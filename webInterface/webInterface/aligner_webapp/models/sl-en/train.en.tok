Alexander Tsiaras : Conception to birth -- visualized
I was offered a position as associate professor of medicine and chief of scientific visualization at Yale University in the department of medicine .
And my job was to write many of the algorithms and code for NASA to do virtual surgery in preparation for the astronauts going into deep spaceflight , so they could be kept in robotic pods .
One of the fascinating things about what we were actually working on is that we were seeing , using new kinds of scanning technologies , things that had just never been seen before -- I mean , not only in disease management , but also things that allowed us to see things about the body that just made you marvel .
I remember one of the first times we were looking at collagen .
And your entire body , everything -- your hair , skin , bone , nails -- everything is made of collagen .
And it &apos;s a kind of rope-like structure that twirls and swirls like this .
And the only place that collagen changes its structure is in the cornea of your eye .
In your eye , it becomes a grid formation , and therefore , it becomes transparent , as opposed to opaque .
So perfectly organized a structure , it was hard not to attribute divinity to it .
Because we kept on seeing this over and over and over again in different parts of the body .
One of the opportunities I had was one person was working on a really interesting micromagnetic resonance imaging machine with the NIH .
And what we were going to do was scan a new project on the development of the fetus from conception to birth using these kinds of new technologies .
So I wrote the algorithms in code , and he built the hardware -- Paul Lauterbur -- then went onto win the Nobel Prize for inventing the MRI .
I got the data .
And I &apos;m going to show you a sample of the piece , &quot; From Conception to Birth . &quot;
Thank you .
But as you can see , when you actually start working on this data , it &apos;s pretty spectacular .
And as we kept on scanning more and more , working on this project , looking at these two simple cells that have this kind of unbelievable machinery that will become the magic of you .
And as we kept on working on this data , looking at small clusters of the body , these little pieces of tissue that were a trophoblast coming off of a blastocyst , all of a sudden burrowing itself into the side of the uterus , saying , &quot; I &apos;m here to stay . &quot;
All of a sudden having conversation and communications with the estrogens , the progesterones , saying , &quot; I &apos;m here to stay , plant me , &quot; building this incredible trilinear fetus that becomes , within 44 days , something that you can recognize , and then at nine weeks is really kind of a little human being .
The marvel of this information : How do we actually have this biological mechanism inside our body to actually see this information ?
I &apos;m going to show you something pretty unique .
Here &apos;s a human heart at 25 &#91; weeks &#93; .
It &apos;s just basically two strands .
And like this magnificent origami , cells are developing at one million cells per second at four weeks , as it &apos;s just folding on itself .
Within five weeks , you can start to see the early atrium and the early ventricles .
Six weeks , these folds are now beginning with the papilla on the inside of the heart actually being able to pull down each one of those valves in your heart until you get a mature heart -- and then basically the development of the entire human body .
The magic of the mechanisms inside each genetic structure saying exactly where that nerve cell should go -- the complexity of these mathematical models of how these things are indeed done are beyond human comprehension .
Even though I am a mathematician , I look at this with marvel of how do these instruction sets not make these mistakes as they build what is us ?
It &apos;s a mystery , it &apos;s magic , it &apos;s divinity .
Then you start to take a look at adult life .
Take a look at this little tuft of capillaries .
It &apos;s just a tiny sub-substructure , microscopic .
But basically by the time you &apos;re nine months and you &apos;re given birth , you have almost 60,000 miles of vessels inside your body .
I mean , and only one mile is visible .
59,999 miles that are basically bringing nutrients and taking waste away .
The complexity of building that within a single system is , again , beyond any comprehension or any existing mathematics today .
And that instruction set , from the brain to every other part of the body -- look at the complexity of the folding .
Where does this intelligence of knowing that a fold can actually hold more information , so as you actually watch the baby &apos;s brain grow -- and this is one of the things that we &apos;re doing right now .
We &apos;re actually doing the launch of two new studies of actually scanning babies &apos; brains from the moment they &apos;re born .
Every six months until they &apos;re six years old -- we &apos;re going to be doing actually to about 250 children -- watching exactly how the gyri and the sulci of the brains fold to see how this magnificent development actually turns into memories and the marvel that is us .
And it &apos;s not just our own existence , but how does the woman &apos;s body understand to have genetic structure that not only builds her own , but then has the understanding that allows her to become a walking immunological , cardiovascular system that basically is a mobile system that can actually nurture , treat this child with a kind of marvel that is beyond , again , our comprehension -- the magic that is existence , that is us ?
Thank you .

Yoav Medan : Ultrasound surgery -- healing without cuts
Over the last 13 years -- one , three , 13 years -- I &apos;ve been part of an exceptional team at InSightec in Israel and partners around the world for taking this idea , this concept , noninvasive surgery , from the research lab to routine clinical use .
And this is what I &apos;ll tell you about .
13 years -- for some of you , you can empathize with that number .
For me , today , on this date , it &apos;s like a second bar mitzvah experience .
So this dream is really enabled by the convergence of two known technologies .
One is the focused ultrasound , and the other one is the vision-enabled magnetic resonance imaging .
So let &apos;s first talk about focused ultrasound .
And I hold in my hand a tissue-mimicking phantom .
It is made out of silicon .
It is transparent , made just for you .
So you see , it &apos;s all intact , completely transparent .
I &apos;ll take you now to the acoustic lab .
You see the phantom within the aquarium .
This is a setup I put in a physics lab .
On the right-hand side , you see an ultrasonic transducer .
So the ultrasonic transducer emits basically an ultrasonic beam that focuses inside the phantom .
Okay , when you hear the click , this is when the energy starts to emit and you see a little lesion form inside the phantom .
Okay , so everything around it is whole and intact .
It &apos;s just a lesion formed inside .
So think about , this is in your brain .
We need to reach a target inside the brain .
We can do it without harming any tissue .
So this is , I think , the first kosher Hippocratic surgical system .
Okay , so let &apos;s talk a little bit about ultrasound , the force of ultrasound .
You know all about imaging , right , ultrasound imaging .
And you know also about lithotripsy -- breaking kidney stones .
But ultrasound can be shaped to be anything in between , because it &apos;s a mechanical force .
Basically , it &apos;s a force acting on a tissue that it transverses .
So you can change the intensity , the frequency , the duration , the pulse shape of the ultrasound to create anything from an airbrush to a hammer .
And I am going to show you multiple applications in the medical field that can be enabled just by focusing , physically focusing .
So this idea of harnessing focused ultrasound to treat lesions in the brain is not new at all .
When I was born , this idea was already conceived by pioneers such as the Fry brothers and Lars Leksell , who is know actually as the inventor of the gammaknife .
But you may not know that he tried to perform lobotomies in the brain , with focused ultrasound in the &apos; 50s .
He failed , so he then invented the gammaknife .
And it makes you ponder why those pioneers failed .
And there was something fundamental that they were missing .
They were missing the vision .
It wasn &apos;t until the invention of the MR and really the integration of MR with focused ultrasound that we could get the feedback -- both the anatomical and the physiological in order to have a completely noninvasive , closed-loop surgical procedure .
So this is how it looks , you know , the operating room of the future today .
This is an MR suite with a focused ultrasound system .
And I will give you several examples .
So the first one is in the brain .
One of the neurological conditions that can be treated with focused ultrasound are movement disorders , like Parkinson &apos;s or essential tremor .
What is typical to those conditions , to essential tremor for example , is inability to drink or eat cereal or soup without spilling everything all over you , or write legibly so people can understand it , and be really independent in your life without the help of others .
So I &apos;d like you to meet John .
John is a retired professor of history from Virginia .
So he suffered from essential tremor for many years .
And medication didn &apos;t help him anymore .
And many of those patients refused to undergo surgery to have people cut into their brain .
And about four or five months ago , he underwent an experimental procedure .
It is approved under an FDAIDE at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville using focused ultrasound to ablate a point in his thalamus .
And this is his handwriting .
&quot; On June 20th , &quot; if you can read it , &quot; 2011 . &quot;
This is his handwriting on the morning of the treatment before going into the MR So now I &apos;ll take you through &#91; what &#93; a typical procedure like that looks like , &#91; what &#93; noninvasive surgery looks like .
So we put the patient on the MR table .
We attach a transducer , in this case , to the brain , but if it will be a different organ , it will be a different transducer attached to the patient .
And the physician will then take a regular MR scan .
And the objective of that ?
I don &apos;t have a pointer here , but you see the green , sort of rectangle or trapezoid ?
This is the sort of general area of the treatment .
It &apos;s a safety boundary around the target .
It &apos;s a target in the thalamus .
So once those pictures are acquired and the physician has drawn all the necessary safety limits and so on , he selects basically a point -- you see the round point in the middle where the cursor is -- and he presses this blue button called &quot; sonicate . &quot;
We call this instance of injecting the energy , we call it sonication .
The only handwork the physician does here is moving a mouse .
This is the only device he needs in this treatment .
So he presses &quot; sonicate , &quot; and this is what happens .
You see the transducer , the light blue .
There &apos;s water in between the skull and the transducer .
And it does this burst of energy .
It elevates the temperature .
We first need to verify that we are on target .
So the first sonication is at lower energy .
It doesn &apos;t do any damage , but it elevates the temperature by a few degrees .
And one of the unique capabilities that we leverage with the MR is the ability to measure temperature noninvasively .
This is really a unique capability of the MR.
It is not being used in regular diagnostic imaging .
But here we can get both the anatomical imaging and the temperature maps in real time .
And you can see the points there on the graph .
The temperature was raised to 43 degrees C temporarily .
This doesn &apos;t cause any damage .
But the point is we are right on target .
So once the physician verifies that the focus spot is on the target he has chosen , then we move to perform a full-energy ablation like you see here .
And you see the temperature rises to like 55 to 60 degrees C.
If you do it for more than a second , it &apos;s enough to basically destroy the proteins of the cells .
This is the outcome from a patient perspective -- same day after the treatment .
This is an immediate relief .
Thank you .
John is one of &#91; about &#93; a dozen very heroic , courageous people who volunteered for the study .
And you have to understand what is in people &apos;s mind when they are willing to take the risk .
And this is a quote from John after he wrote it .
He said , &quot; Miraculous . &quot;
And his wife said , &quot; This is the happiest moment of my life . &quot;
And you wonder why .
I mean , one of the messages I like to carry over is , what about defending quality of life ?
I mean , those people lose their independence .
They are dependent on others .
And John today is fully independent .
He returned to a normal life routine .
And he also plays golf , like you do in Virginia when you are retired .
Okay , so you can see here the spot .
It &apos;s like three millimeters in the middle of the brain .
There &apos;s no damage outside .
He suffers from no neurodeficit .
There &apos;s no recovery needed , no nothing .
He &apos;s back to his normal life .
Let &apos;s move now to a more painful subject .
Pain is something that can make your life miserable .
And people are suffering from all kinds of pain like neuropathic pain , lower-back pain and cancer pain from bone metastases , when the metastases get to your bones , sometimes they are very painful .
All those I &apos;ve indicated have already been shown to be successfully treated by focused ultrasound relieving the pain , again , very fast .
And I would like to tell you about PJ .
He &apos;s a 78 year-old farmer who suffered from -- how should I say it ? -- it &apos;s called pain in the butt .
He had metastases in his right buttock , and he couldn &apos;t sit even with medication .
He had to forgo all the farm activities .
He was treated with radiation therapy , state-of-the-art radiation therapy , but it didn &apos;t help .
Many patients like that favor radiation therapy .
And again , he volunteered to a pivotal study that we ran worldwide , also in the U.S.
And his wife actually took him .
They drove like three hours from their farm to the hospital .
He had to sit on a cushion , stand still , not move , because it was very painful .
He took the treatment , and on the way back , he drove the truck by himself .
So again , this is an immediate relief .
And you have to understand what those people feel and what their family experiences when it happens .
He returned again to his daily routine on the farm .
He rides his tractor .
He rides his horse to their mountain cabin regularly .
And he has been very happy .
But now , you ask me , but what about war , the war on cancer ?
Show us some primary cancer .
What can be done there ?
So I have good news and bad news .
The good news : there &apos;s a lot that can be done .
And it has been shown actually outside of the U.S.
And doing that in the U.S.
is very painful .
I don &apos;t see , without this nation taking it as some collective will or something that is a national goal to make that happen , it will not happen .
And it &apos;s not just because of regulation ; it &apos;s because of the amount of money needed under the current evidence-based medicine and the size of trials and so on to make it happen .
So the first two applications are breast cancer and prostate cancer .
They were the first to be treated by focused ultrasound .
And we have better-than-surgery results in breasts .
But I have a message for the men here .
We heard here yesterday Quyen talking about the adverse event trait in prostate cancer .
There is a unique opportunity now with focused ultrasound guided by MR , because we can actually think about prostate lumpectomy -- treating just the focal lesion and not removing the whole gland , and by that , avoiding all the issues with potency and incontinence .
Well , there are other cancer tumors in the abdomen -- quite lethal , very lethal actually -- pancreas , liver , kidney .
The challenge there with a breathing and awake patient -- and in all our treatments , the patient is awake and conscious and speaks with the physician -- is you have to teach the MR some tricks how to do it in real time .
And this will take time .
This will take two years .
But I have now a message to the ladies .
And this is , in 2004 , the FDA has approved MR-guided focused ultrasounds for the treatment of symptomatic uterine fibroids .
Women suffer from that disease .
All those tumors have heavy bleeding during periods , abdominal pressure , back pain , frequent urination .
And sometimes , they cannot even conceive and become pregnant because of the fibroid .
This is Frances .
She was diagnosed with a grapefruit-sized fibroid .
This is a big fibroid .
She was offered a hysterectomy , but this is an inconceivable proposition for someone who wants to keep her pregnancy option .
So she elected to undergo a focused ultrasound procedure in 2008 .
And in 2010 , she became a first-time mother to a healthy baby .
So new life was born .
So in conclusion , I &apos;d like to leave you with actually four messages .
One is , think about the amount of suffering that is saved from patients undergoing noninvasive surgery , and also the economical and emotional burden removed from their families and communities and the society at large -- and I think also from their physicians , by the way .
And the other thing I would like you to think about is the new type of relationship between physician and patients when you have a patient on the table &#91; who &#93; is awake and can even monitor the treatment .
In all our treatments , the patient holds a stop sonication button .
He can stop the surgery at any moment .
And with that note , I would like to thank you for listening .

Phil Plait : How to defend Earth from asteroids
I want to talk to you about something kind of big .
We &apos;ll start here .
65 million years ago the dinosaurs had a bad day .
A chunk of rock six miles across , moving something like 50 times the speed of a rifle bullet , slammed into the Earth .
It released its energy all at once , and it was an explosion that was mind-numbing .
If you took every nuclear weapon ever built at the height of the Cold War , lumped them together and blew them up at the same time , that would be one one-millionth of the energy released at that moment .
The dinosaurs had a really bad day .
Okay ?
Now , a six-mile-wide rock is very large .
We all live here in Boulder .
If you look out your window and you can see Long &apos;s Peak , you &apos;re probably familiar with it .
Now , scoop up Long &apos;s Peak , and put it out in space .
Take Meeker , Mt . Meeker . Lump that in there , and put that in space as well , and Mt . Everest , and K2 , and the Indian peaks .
Then you &apos;re starting to get an idea of how much rock we &apos;re talking about , okay ?
We know it was that big because of the impact it had and the crater it left .
It hit in what we now know as Yucatan , the Gulf of Mexico .
You can see here , there &apos;s the Yucatan Peninsula , if you recognize Cozumel off the east coast there .
Here is how big of a crater was left .
It was huge . To give you a sense of the scale , okay , there you go . The scale here is 50 miles on top , a hundred kilometers on the bottom . This thing was 300 kilometers across -- 200 miles -- an enormous crater that excavated out vast amounts of earth that splashed around the globe and set fires all over the planet , threw up enough dust to block out the sun .
It wiped out 75 percent of all species on Earth .
Now , not all asteroids are that big .
Some of them are smaller .
Here is one that came in over the United States in October of 1992 .
It came in on a Friday night .
Why is that important ?
Because back then , video cameras were just starting to become popular , and people would bring them , parents would bring them , to their kids &apos; football games to film their kids play football . And since this came in on a Friday , they were able to get this great footage of this thing breaking up as it came in over West Virgina , Maryland , Pennsylvania and New Jersey until it did that to a car in New York .
Now , this is not a 200-mile-wide crater , but then again you can see the rock which is sitting right here , about the size of a football , that hit that car and did that damage .
Now this thing was probably about the size of a school bus when it first came in .
It broke up through atmospheric pressure , it crumbled , and then the pieces fell apart and did some damage .
Now , you wouldn &apos;t want that falling on your foot or your head , because it would do that to it .
That would be bad .
But it won &apos;t wipe out , you know , all life on Earth , so that &apos;s fine . But it turns out , you don &apos;t need something six miles across to do a lot of damage .
There is a median point between tiny rock and gigantic rock , and in fact , if any of you have ever been to near Winslow , Arizona , there is a crater in the desert there that is so iconic that it is actually called Meteor Crater .
To give you a sense of scale , this is about a mile wide .
If you look up at the top , that &apos;s a parking lot , and those are recreational vehicles right there .
So it &apos;s about a mile across , 600 feet deep .
The object that formed this was probably about 30 to 50 yards across , so roughly the size of Mackey Auditorium here .
It came in at speeds that were tremendous , slammed into the ground , blew up , and exploded with the energy of roughly a 20-megaton nuclear bomb -- a very hefty bomb .
This was 50,000 years ago , so it may have wiped out a few buffalo or antelope , or something like that out in the desert , but it probably would not have caused global devastation .
It turns out that these things don &apos;t have to hit the ground to do a lot of damage .
Now , in 1908 , over Siberia , near the Tunguska region -- for those of you who are Dan Aykroyd fans and saw &quot; Ghostbusters , &quot; when he talked about the greatest cross-dimensional rift since the Siberia blast of 1909 , where he got the date wrong , but that &apos;s okay .
It was 1908 . That &apos;s fine . I can live with that .
Another rock came into the Earth &apos;s atmosphere and this one blew up above the ground , several miles up above the surface of the Earth .
The heat from the explosion set fire to the forest below it , and then the shock wave came down and knocked down trees for hundreds of square miles , okay ?
This did a huge amount of damage .
And again , this was a rock probably roughly the size of this auditorium that we &apos;re sitting in .
In Meteor Crater it was made of metal , and metal is much tougher , so it made it to the ground .
The one over Tunguska was probably made of rock , and that &apos;s much more crumbly , so it blew up in the air . Either way , these are tremendous explosions , 20 megatons .
Now , when these things blow up , they &apos;re not going to do global ecological damage .
They &apos;re not going to do something like the dinosaur-killer did .
They &apos;re just not big enough .
But they will do global economic damage , because they don &apos;t have to hit , necessarily , to do this kind of damage .
They don &apos;t have to do global devastation .
If one of these things were to hit pretty much anywhere , it would cause a panic .
But if it came over a city , an important city -- not that any city is more important than others , but some of them we depend on them more on the global economic basis -- that could do a huge amount of damage to us as a civilization .
So , now that I &apos;ve scared the crap out of you ...
what can we do about this ? All right ?
This is a potential threat .
Let me note that we have not had a giant impact like the dinosaur-killer for 65 million years . They &apos;re very rare .
The smaller ones happen more often , but probably on the order of a millennium , every few centuries or every few thousand years , but it &apos;s still something to be aware of .
Well , what do we do about them ?
The first thing we have to do is find them .
This is an image of an asteroid that passed us in 2009 .
It &apos;s right here .
But you can see that it &apos;s extremely faint .
I don &apos;t even know if you can see that in the back row . These are just stars .
This is a rock that was about 30 yards across , so roughly the size of the ones that blew up over Tunguska and hit Arizona 50,000 years ago .
These things are faint .
They &apos;re hard to see , and the sky is really big .
We have to find these things first .
Well the good news is , we &apos;re looking for them .
NASA has devoted money to this .
The National Science Foundation , other countries are very interested in doing this .
We &apos;re building telescopes that are looking for the threat . That &apos;s a great first step , but what &apos;s the second step ? The second step is that we see one heading toward us , we have to stop it . What do we do ?
You &apos;ve probably heard about the asteroid Apophis . If you haven &apos;t yet , you will .
If you &apos;ve heard about the Mayan 2012 apocalypse , you &apos;re going to hear about Apophis , because you &apos;re keyed in to all the doomsday networks anyway .
Apophis is an asteroid that was discovered in 2004 .
It &apos;s roughly 250 yards across , so it &apos;s pretty big -- big size , you know , bigger than a football stadium -- and it &apos;s going to pass by the Earth in April of 2029 .
And it &apos;s going to pass us so close that it &apos;s actually going to come underneath our weather satellites .
The Earth &apos;s gravity is going to bend the orbit of this thing so much that if it &apos;s just right , if it passes through this region of space , this kidney bean-shaped region called the keyhole , the Earth &apos;s gravity will bend it just enough that seven years later on April 13 , which is a Friday , I &apos;ll note , in the year 2036 ...
-- you can &apos;t plan that kind of stuff -- Apophis is going to hit us . And it &apos;s 250 meters across , so it would do unbelievable damage .
Now the good news is that the odds of it actually passing through this keyhole and hitting us next go-around are one in a million , roughly -- very , very low odds , so I personally am not lying awake at night worrying about this at all .
I don &apos;t think Apophis is a problem .
In fact , Apophis is a blessing in disguise , because it woke us up to the dangers of these things .
This thing was discovered just a few years ago and could hit us a few years from now .
It won &apos;t , but it gives us a chance to study these kinds of asteroids . We didn &apos;t really necessarily understand these keyholes , and now we do and it turns out that &apos;s really important , because how do you stop an asteroid like this ?
Well , let me ask you , what happens if you &apos;re standing in the middle of the road and a car &apos;s headed for you ? What do you do ? You do this .
Right ? Move . The car goes past you .
But we can &apos;t move the Earth , at least not easily , but we can move a small asteroid .
And it turns out , we &apos;ve even done it .
In the year 2005 , NASA launched a probe called Deep Impact , which slammed into -- slammed a piece of itself into the nucleus of a comet .
Comets are very much like asteroids .
The purpose wasn &apos;t to push it out of the way .
The purpose was to make a crater to excavate the material and see what was underneath the surface of this comet , which we learned quite a bit about .
We did move the comet a little tiny bit , not very much , but that wasn &apos;t the point .
However , think about this .
This thing is orbiting the sun at 10 miles per second , 20 miles per second .
We shot a space probe at it and hit it . Okay ?
Imagine how hard that must be , and we did it .
That means we can do it again .
If we need , if we see an asteroid that &apos;s coming toward us , and it &apos;s headed right for us , and we have two years to go , boom ! We hit it .
You can try to -- you know , if you watch the movies , you might think about , why don &apos;t we use a nuclear weapon ?
It &apos;s like , well , you can try that , but the problem is timing .
You shoot a nuclear weapon at this thing , you have to blow it up within a few milliseconds of tolerance or else you &apos;ll just miss it .
And there are a lot of other problems with that . It &apos;s very hard to do .
But just hitting something ? That &apos;s pretty easy .
I think even NASA can do that , and they proved that they can .
The problem is , what happens if you hit this asteroid , you &apos;ve changed the orbit , you measure the orbit and then you find out , oh , yeah , we just pushed it into a keyhole , and now it &apos;s going to hit us in three years .
Well , my opinion is , fine . Okay ?
It &apos;s not hitting us in six months . That &apos;s good .
Now we have three years to do something else .
And you can hit it again . That &apos;s kind of ham-fisted . You might just push it into a third keyhole or whatever , so you don &apos;t do that .
And this is the part , it &apos;s the part I just love .
After the big macho &quot; Rrrrrrr BAM ! We &apos;re gonna hit this thing in the face , &quot; then we bring in the velvet gloves .
There &apos;s a group of scientists and engineers and astronauts and they call themselves The B612 Foundation . For those of you who &apos;ve read &quot; The Little Prince , &quot; you understand that reference , I hope . The little prince who lived on an asteroid , it was called B612 .
These are smart guys -- men and women -- astronauts , like I said , engineers .
Rusty Schweickart , who was an Apollo 9 astronaut , is on this . Dan Durda , my friend who made this image , works here at Southwest Research Institute in Boulder , on Walnut Street . He created this image for this , and he &apos;s actually one of the astronomers who works for them . If we see an asteroid that &apos;s going to hit the Earth and we have enough time , we can hit it to move it into a better orbit . But then what we do is we launch a probe that has to weigh a ton or two .
It doesn &apos;t have to be huge -- couple of tons , not that big -- and you park it near the asteroid .
You don &apos;t land on it , because these things are tumbling end over end . It &apos;s very hard to land on them .
Instead you get near it .
The gravity of the asteroid pulls on the probe , and the probe has a couple of tons of mass .
It has a little tiny bit of gravity , but it &apos;s enough that it can pull the asteroid , and you have your rockets set up , so you can -- oh , you can barely see it here , but there &apos;s rocket plumes -- and you basically , these guys are connected by their own gravity , and if you move the probe very slowly , very , very gently , you can very easily finesse that rock into a safe orbit .
You can even put in orbit around the Earth where we could mine it , although that &apos;s a whole other thing . I won &apos;t go into that .
But we &apos;d be rich !
So think about this , right ?
There are these giant rocks flying out there , and they &apos;re hitting us , and they &apos;re doing damage to us , but we &apos;ve figured out how to do this , and all the pieces are in place to do this .
We have astronomers in place with telescopes looking for them . We have smart people , very , very smart people , who are concerned about this and figuring out how to fix the problem , and we have the technology to do this .
This probe actually can &apos;t use chemical rockets .
Chemical rockets provide too much thrust , too much push . The probe would just shoot away .
We invented something called an ion drive , which is a very , very , very low-thrust engine .
It generates the force a piece of paper would have on your hand , incredibly light , but it can run for months and years , providing that very gentle push .
If anybody here is a fan of the original &quot; Star Trek , &quot; they ran across an alien ship that had an ion drive , and Spock said , &quot; They &apos;re very technically sophisticated .
They &apos;re a hundred years ahead of us with this drive . &quot;
Yeah , we have an ion drive now .
We don &apos;t have the Enterprise , but we &apos;ve got an ion drive now .
Spock .
So ...
that &apos;s the difference , that &apos;s the difference between us and the dinosaurs .
This happened to them .
It doesn &apos;t have to happen to us .
The difference between the dinosaurs and us is that we have a space program and we can vote , and so we can change our future .
We have the ability to change our future .
65 million years from now , we don &apos;t have to have our bones collecting dust in a museum .
Thank you very much .

Damon Horowitz : Philosophy in prison
Meet Tony . He &apos;s my student .
He &apos;s about my age , and he &apos;s in San Quentin State Prison .
When Tony was 16 years old , one day , one moment , &quot; It was mom &apos;s gun .
Just flash it , scare the guy . He &apos;s a punk .
He took some money ; we &apos;ll take his money . That &apos;ll teach him .
Then last minute , I &apos;m thinking , &apos; Can &apos;t do this . This is wrong . &apos; My buddy says , &apos; C &apos;mon , let &apos;s do this . &apos; I say , &apos; Let &apos;s do this . &apos; &quot; And those three words , Tony &apos;s going to remember , because the next thing he knows , he hears the pop .
There &apos;s the punk on the ground , puddle of blood .
And that &apos;s felony murder -- 25 to life , parole at 50 if you &apos;re lucky , and Tony &apos;s not feeling very lucky .
So when we meet in my philosophy class in his prison and I say , &quot; In this class , we will discuss the foundations of ethics , &quot; Tony interrupts me .
&quot; What are you going to teach me about right and wrong ?
I know what is wrong . I have done wrong .
I am told every day , by every face I see , every wall I face , that I am wrong .
If I ever get out of here , there will always be a mark by my name .
I &apos;m a convict ; I am branded &apos; wrong . &apos; What are you going to tell me about right and wrong ? &quot;
So I say to Tony , &quot; Sorry , but it &apos;s worse than you think .
You think you know right and wrong ?
Then can you tell me what wrong is ?
No , don &apos;t just give me an example .
I want to know about wrongness itself , the idea of wrong .
What is that idea ?
What makes something wrong ?
How do we know that it &apos;s wrong ? Maybe you and I disagree .
Maybe one of us is wrong about the wrong .
Maybe it &apos;s you , maybe it &apos;s me -- but we &apos;re not here to trade opinions ; everyone &apos;s got an opinion .
We are here for knowledge .
Our enemy is thoughtlessness . This is philosophy . &quot;
And something changes for Tony .
&quot; Could be I &apos;m wrong . I &apos;m tired of being wrong .
I want to know what is wrong .
I want to know what I know . &quot;
What Tony sees in that moment is the project of philosophy , the project that begins in wonder -- what Kant called &quot; admiration and awe at the starry sky above and the moral law within . &quot;
What can creatures like us know of such things ?
It is the project that always takes us back to the condition of existence -- what Heidegger called &quot; the always already there . &quot;
It is the project of questioning what we believe and why we believe it -- what Socrates called &quot; the examined life . &quot;
Socrates , a man wise enough to know that he knows nothing .
Socrates died in prison , his philosophy intact .
So Tony starts doing his homework .
He learns his whys and wherefores , his causes and correlations , his logic , his fallacies .
Turns out , Tony &apos;s got the philosophy muscle .
His body is in prison , but his mind is free .
Tony learns about the ontologically promiscuous , the epistemologically anxious , the ethically dubious , the metaphysically ridiculous .
That &apos;s Plato , Descartes , Nietzsche and Bill Clinton .
So when he gives me his final paper , in which he argues that the categorical imperative is perhaps too uncompromising to deal with the conflict that affects our everyday and challenges me to tell him whether therefore we are condemned to moral failure , I say , &quot; I don &apos;t know .
Let us think about that . &quot;
Because in that moment , there &apos;s no mark by Tony &apos;s name ; it &apos;s just the two of us standing there .
It is not professor and convict , it is just two minds ready to do philosophy .
And I say to Tony , &quot; Let &apos;s do this . &quot;
Thank you .

Political prisoners aren &apos;t the only ones being tortured -- the vast majority of judicial torture happens in ordinary cases , even in &apos; functioning &apos; legal systems . Social activist Karen Tse shows how we can , and should , stand up and end the use of routine torture .

Karen Tse : How to stop torture
In 1994 , I walked into a prison in Cambodia , and I met a 12-year-old boy who had been tortured and was denied access to counsel .
And as I looked into his eyes , I realized that for the hundreds of letters I had written for political prisoners , that I would never have written a letter for him , because he was not a 12-year-old boy who had done something important for anybody .
He was not a political prisoner .
He was a 12-year-old boy who had stolen a bicycle .
What I also realized at that point was that it was not only Cambodia , but developing countries that torture , 93 of these countries have all passed laws that say you have a right to a lawyer and you have a right not to be tortured .
And what I recognized was that there was an incredible window of opportunity for us as a world community to come together and end torture as an investigative tool .
We often think of torture as being political torture or reserved for just the worst , but , in fact , 95 percent of torture today is not for political prisoners .
It is for people who are in broken-down legal systems , and unfortunately because torture is the cheapest form of investigation -- it &apos;s cheaper than having a legal system , cheaper than having a lawyer and early access to counsel -- it is what happens most of the time .
I believe today that it is possible for us as a world community , if we make a decision , to come together and end torture as an investigative tool in our lifetime , but it will require three things .
First is the training , empowerment , and connection of defenders worldwide .
The second is insuring that there is systematic early access to counsel .
And the third is commitment .
So in the year 2000 , I began to wonder , what if we came together ?
Could we do something for these 93 countries ?
And I founded International Bridges to Justice which has a specific mission of ending torture as an investigative tool and implementing due process rights in the 93 countries by placing trained lawyers at an early stage in police stations and in courtrooms .
My first experiences , though , did come from Cambodia , and at the time I remember first coming to Cambodia and there were , in 1994 , still less than 10 attorneys in the country because the Khmer Rouge had killed them all .
And even 20 years later , there was only 10 lawyers in the country , so consequently you &apos;d walk into a prison and not only would you meet 12-year-old boys , you &apos;d meet women and you &apos;d say , &quot; Why are you here ? &quot; Women would say , &quot; Well I &apos;ve been here for 10 years because my husband committed a crime , but they can &apos;t find him . &quot;
So it &apos;s just a place where there was no rule of law .
The first group of defenders came together and I still remember , as I was training , I said , &quot; Okay , what do you do for an investigation ? &quot;
And there was silence in the class , and finally one woman stood up , &#91; inaudible name &#93; , and she said &quot; Khrew , &quot; which means &quot; teacher . &quot;
She said , &quot; I have defended more than a hundred people , and I &apos;ve never had to do any investigation , because they all come with confessions . &quot;
And we talked about , as a class , the fact that number one , the confessions might not be reliable , but number two , we did not want to encourage the police to keep doing this , especially as it was now against the law .
And it took a lot of courage for these defenders to decide that they would begin to stand up and support each other in implementing these laws .
And I still remember the first cases where they came , all 25 together , she would stand up , and they were in the back , and they would support her , and the judges kept saying , &quot; No , no , no , no , we &apos;re going to do things the exact same way we &apos;ve been doing them . &quot;
But one day the perfect case came , and it was a woman who was a vegetable seller , she was sitting outside of a house .
She said she actually saw the person run out who she thinks stole whatever the jewelry was , but the police came , they got her , there was nothing on her .
She was pregnant at the time . She had cigarette burns on her . She &apos;d miscarried .
And when they brought her case to the judge , for the first time he stood up and he said , &quot; Yes , there &apos;s no evidence except for your torture confession and you will be released . &quot;
And the defenders began to take cases over and over again and you will see , they have step by step began to change the course of history in Cambodia .
But Cambodia is not alone .
I used to think , well is it Cambodia ?
Or is it other countries ?
But it is in so many countries .
In Burundi I walked into a prison and it wasn &apos;t a 12-year-old boy , it was an 8-year-old boy for stealing a mobile phone .
Or a woman , I picked up her baby , really cute baby , I said &quot; Your baby is so cute . &quot;
It wasn &apos;t a baby , she was three .
And she said &quot; Yeah , but she &apos;s why I &apos;m here , &quot; because she was accused of stealing two diapers and an iron for her baby and still had been in prison .
And when I walked up to the prison director , I said , &quot; You &apos;ve got to let her out .
A judge would let her out . &quot;
And he said , &quot; Okay , we can talk about it , but look at my prison . Eighty percent of the two thousand people here are without a lawyer . What can we do ? &quot;
So lawyers began to courageously stand up together to organize a system where they can take cases .
But we realized that it &apos;s not only the training of the lawyers , but the connection of the lawyers that makes a difference .
For example , in Cambodia , it was that &#91; inaudible name &#93; did not go alone but she had 24 lawyers with her who stood up together . And in the same way , in China , they always tell me , &quot; It &apos;s like a fresh wind in the desert when we can come together . &quot;
Or in Zimbabwe , where I remember Innocent , after coming out of a prison where everybody stood up and said , &quot; I &apos;ve been here for one year , eight years , 12 years without a lawyer , &quot; he came and we had a training together and he said , &quot; I have heard it said &quot; -- because he had heard people mumbling and grumbling -- &quot; I have heard it said that we cannot help to create justice because we do not have the resources . &quot;
And then he said , &quot; But I want you to know that the lack of resources is never an excuse for injustice . &quot;
And with that , he successfully organized 68 lawyers who have been systematically taking the cases .
The key that we see , though , is training and then early access .
I was recently in Egypt , and was inspired to meet with another group of lawyers , and what they told me is that they said , &quot; Hey , look , we don &apos;t have police on the streets now . The police are one of the main reasons why we had the revolution . They were torturing everybody all the time . &quot;
And I said , &quot; But there &apos;s been tens of millions of dollars that have recently gone in to the development of the legal system here .
What &apos;s going on ? &quot;
I met with one of the development agencies , and they were training prosecutors and judges , which is the normal bias , as opposed to defenders .
And they showed me a manual which actually was an excellent manual .
I said , &quot; I &apos;m gonna copy this . &quot;
It had everything in it . Lawyers can come at the police station . It was perfect .
Prosecutors were perfectly trained .
But I said to them , &quot; I just have one question , which is , by the time that everybody got to the prosecutor &apos;s office , what had happened to them ? &quot;
And after a pause , they said , &quot; They had been tortured . &quot;
So the pieces are , not only the training of the lawyers , but us finding a way to systematically implement early access to counsel , because they are the safeguard in the system for people who are being tortured .
And as I tell you this , I &apos;m also aware of the fact that it sounds like , &quot; Oh , okay , it sounds like we could do it , but can we really do it ? &quot;
Because it sounds big .
And there are many reasons why I believe it &apos;s possible .
The first reason is the people on the ground who find ways of creating miracles because of their commitment .
It &apos;s not only Innocent , who I told you about in Zimbabwe , but defenders all over the world who are looking for these pieces .
We have a program called JusticeMakers , and we realized there are people that are courageous and want to do things , but how can we support them ?
So it &apos;s an online contest where it &apos;s only five thousand dollars if you come up with and innovative way of implementing justice .
And there are 30 JusticeMakers throughout the world , from Sri Lanka to Swaziland to the DRC , who with five thousand dollars do amazing things , through SMS programs , through paralegal programs , through whatever they can do .
And it &apos;s not only these JusticeMakers , but people we courageously see figure out who their networks are and how they can move it forward .
So in China , for instance , great laws came out where it says police cannot torture people or they will be punished .
And I was sitting side by side with one of our very courageous lawyers , and said , &quot; How can we get this out ? How can we make sure that this is implemented ?
This is fantastic . &quot; And he said to me , &quot; Well , do you have money ? &quot; And I said , &quot; No . &quot; And he said , &quot; That &apos;s okay , we can still figure it out . &quot;
And on December 4 , he organized three thousand members of the Youth Communist League , from 14 of the top law schools , who organized themselves , developed posters with the new laws , and went to the police stations and began what he says is a non-violent legal revolution to protect citizen rights .
So I talked about the fact that we need to train and support defenders .
We need to systematically implement early access to counsel .
But the third and most important thing is that we make a commitment to this .
And people often say to me , &quot; You know , this is great , but it &apos;s wildly idealistic .
Never going to happen . &quot;
And the reason that I think that those words are interesting is because those were the same kinds of words that were used for people who decided they would end slavery , or end apartheid .
It began with a small group of people who decided they would commit .
Now , there &apos;s one of our favorite poems from the defenders , which they share from each other , is : &quot; Take courage friends , the road is often long , the path is never clear , and the stakes are very high , but deep down , you are not alone . &quot;
And I believe that if we can come together as a world community to support not only defenders , but also everyone in the system who is looking towards it , we can end torture as an investigative tool .
I end always , because I &apos;m sure the questions are -- and I &apos;d be happy to talk to you at any point -- &quot; But what can I really do ? &quot;
Well , I would say this . First of all , you know what you can do . But second of all , I would leave you with the story of Vishna , who actually was my inspiration for starting International Bridges to Justice .
Vishna was a 4-year-old boy when I met him who was born in a Cambodian prison in Kandal Province . But because he was born in the prison , everybody loved him , including the guards , so he was the only one who was allowed to come in and out of the bars .
So , you know , there &apos;s bars . And by the time that Vishna was getting bigger , which means what gets bigger ? Your head gets bigger .
So he would come to the first bar , the second bar and then the third bar , and then really slowly move his head so he could fit through , and come back , third , second , first . And he would grab my pinkie , because what he wanted to do every day is he wanted to go visit .
You know , he never quite made it to all of them every day , but he wanted to visit all 156 prisoners . And I would lift him , and he would put his fingers through .
Or if they were dark cells , it was like iron corrugated , and he would put his fingers through .
And most of the prisoners said that he was their greatest joy and their sunshine , and they looked forward to him . And I was like , here &apos;s Vishna . He &apos;s a 4-year-old boy .
He was born in a prison with almost nothing , no material goods , but he had a sense of his own heroic journey , which I believe we are all born into . He said , &quot; Probably I can &apos;t do everything .
But I &apos;m one . I can do something .
And I will do the one thing that I can do . &quot;
So I thank you for having the prophetic imagination to imagine the shaping of a new world with us together , and invite you into this journey with us .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .

At TEDMED , Sheila Nirenberg shows a bold way to create sight in people with certain kinds of blindness : by hooking into the optic nerve and sending signals from a camera direct to the brain .

Sheila Nirenberg : A prosthetic eye to treat blindness
I study how the brain processes information . That is , how it takes information in from the outside world , and converts it into patterns of electrical activity , and then how it uses those patterns to allow you to do things -- to see , hear , to reach for an object .
So I &apos;m really a basic scientist , not a clinician , but in the last year and a half I &apos;ve started to switch over , to use what we &apos;ve been learning about these patterns of activity to develop prosthetic devices , and what I wanted to do today is show you an example of this .
It &apos;s really our first foray into this .
It &apos;s the development of a prosthetic device for treating blindness .
So let me start in on that problem .
There are 10 million people in the U.S.
and many more worldwide who are blind or are facing blindness due to diseases of the retina , diseases like macular degeneration , and there &apos;s little that can be done for them .
There are some drug treatments , but they &apos;re only effective on a small fraction of the population . And so , for the vast majority of patients , their best hope for regaining sight is through prosthetic devices .
The problem is that current prosthetics don &apos;t work very well . They &apos;re still very limited in the vision that they can provide .
And so , you know , for example , with these devices , patients can see simple things like bright lights and high contrast edges , not very much more , so nothing close to normal vision has been possible .
So what I &apos;m going to tell you about today is a device that we &apos;ve been working on that I think has the potential to make a difference , to be much more effective , and what I wanted to do is show you how it works . Okay , so let me back up a little bit and show you how a normal retina works first so you can see the problem that we were trying to solve .
Here you have a retina .
So you have an image , a retina , and a brain .
So when you look at something , like this image of this baby &apos;s face , it goes into your eye and it lands on your retina , on the front-end cells here , the photoreceptors .
Then what happens is the retinal circuitry , the middle part , goes to work on it , and what it does is it performs operations on it , it extracts information from it , and it converts that information into a code .
And the code is in the form of these patterns of electrical pulses that get sent up to the brain , and so the key thing is that the image ultimately gets converted into a code . And when I say code , I do literally mean code .
Like this pattern of pulses here actually means &quot; baby &apos;s face , &quot; and so when the brain gets this pattern of pulses , it knows that what was out there was a baby &apos;s face , and if it got a different pattern it would know that what was out there was , say , a dog , or another pattern would be a house .
Anyway , you get the idea .
And , of course , in real life , it &apos;s all dynamic , meaning that it &apos;s changing all the time , so the patterns of pulses are changing all the time because the world you &apos;re looking at is changing all the time too .
So , you know , it &apos;s sort of a complicated thing . You have these patterns of pulses coming out of your eye every millisecond telling your brain what it is that you &apos;re seeing .
So what happens when a person gets a retinal degenerative disease like macular degeneration ? What happens is is that , the front-end cells die , the photoreceptors die , and over time , all the cells and the circuits that are connected to them , they die too .
Until the only things that you have left are these cells here , the output cells , the ones that send the signals to the brain , but because of all that degeneration they aren &apos;t sending any signals anymore .
They aren &apos;t getting any input , so the person &apos;s brain no longer gets any visual information -- that is , he or she is blind .
So , a solution to the problem , then , would be to build a device that could mimic the actions of that front-end circuitry and send signals to the retina &apos;s output cells , and they can go back to doing their normal job of sending signals to the brain .
So this is what we &apos;ve been working on , and this is what our prosthetic does .
So it consists of two parts , what we call an encoder and a transducer .
And so the encoder does just what I was saying : it mimics the actions of the front-end circuitry -- so it takes images in and converts them into the retina &apos;s code .
And then the transducer then makes the output cells send the code on up to the brain , and the result is a retinal prosthetic that can produce So a completely blind retina , even one with no front-end circuitry at all , no photoreceptors , can now send out normal signals , signals that the brain can understand .
So no other device has been able to do this .
Okay , so I just want to take a sentence or two to say something about the encoder and what it &apos;s doing , because it &apos;s really the key part and it &apos;s sort of interesting and kind of cool .
I &apos;m not sure &quot; cool &quot; is really the right word , but you know what I mean .
So what it &apos;s doing is , it &apos;s replacing the retinal circuitry , really the guts of the retinal circuitry , with a set of equations , a set of equations that we can implement on a chip . So it &apos;s just math .
In other words , we &apos;re not literally replacing the components of the retina .
It &apos;s not like we &apos;re making a little mini-device for each of the different cell types .
We &apos;ve just abstracted what the retina &apos;s doing with a set of equations .
And so , in a way , the equations are serving as sort of a codebook . An image comes in , goes through the set of equations , and out comes streams of electrical pulses , just like a normal retina would produce .
Now let me put my money where my mouth is and show you that we can actually produce normal output , and what the implications of this are .
Here are three sets of firing patterns . The top one is from a normal animal , the middle one is from a blind animal that &apos;s been treated with this encoder-transducer device , and the bottom one is from a blind animal treated with a standard prosthetic .
So the bottom one is the state-of-the-art device that &apos;s out there right now , which is basically made up of light detectors , but no encoder . So what we did was we presented movies of everyday things -- people , babies , park benches , you know , regular things happening -- and we recorded the responses from the retinas of these three groups of animals .
Now just to orient you , each box is showing the firing patterns of several cells , and just as in the previous slides , each row is a different cell , and I just made the pulses a little bit smaller and thinner so I could show you a long stretch of data .
So as you can see , the firing patterns from the blind animal treated with the encoder-transducer really do very closely match the normal firing patterns -- and it &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s pretty good -- and the blind animal treated with the standard prosthetic , the responses really don &apos;t .
And so with the standard method , the cells do fire , they just don &apos;t fire in the normal firing patterns because they don &apos;t have the right code .
How important is this ?
What &apos;s the potential impact on a patient &apos;s ability to see ?
So I &apos;m just going to show you one bottom-line experiment that answers this , and of course I &apos;ve got a lot of other data , so if you &apos;re interested I &apos;m happy to show more . So the experiment is called a reconstruction experiment .
So what we did is we took a moment in time from these recordings and asked , what was the retina seeing at that moment ?
Can we reconstruct what the retina was seeing from the responses from the firing patterns ?
So , when we did this for responses from the standard method and from our encoder and transducer .
So let me show you , and I &apos;m going to start with the standard method first .
So you can see that it &apos;s pretty limited , and because the firing patterns aren &apos;t in the right code , they &apos;re very limited in what they can tell you about what &apos;s out there . So you can see that there &apos;s something there , but it &apos;s not so clear what that something is , and this just sort of circles back to what I was saying in the beginning , that with the standard method , patients can see high-contrast edges , they can see light , but it doesn &apos;t easily go further than that . So what was the image ? It was a baby &apos;s face .
So what about with our approach , adding the code ? And you can see that it &apos;s much better . Not only can you tell that it &apos;s a baby &apos;s face , but you can tell that it &apos;s this baby &apos;s face , which is a really challenging task .
So on the left is the encoder alone , and on the right is from an actual blind retina , so the encoder and the transducer .
But the key one really is the encoder alone , because we can team up the encoder with the different transducer .
This is just actually the first one that we tried .
I just wanted to say something about the standard method .
When this first came out , it was just a really exciting thing , the idea that you even make a blind retina respond at all .
But there was this limiting factor , the issue of the code , and how to make the cells respond better , produce normal responses , and so this was our contribution .
Now I just want to wrap up , and as I was mentioning earlier of course I have a lot of other data if you &apos;re interested , but I just wanted to give this sort of basic idea of being able to communicate with the brain in its language , and the potential power of being able to do that .
So it &apos;s different from the motor prosthetics where you &apos;re communicating from the brain to a device . Here we have to communicate from the outside world into the brain and be understood , and be understood by the brain .
And then the last thing I wanted to say , really , is to emphasize that the idea generalizes .
So the same strategy that we used to find the code for the retina we can also use to find the code for other areas , for example , the auditory system and the motor system , so for treating deafness and for motor disorders .
So just the same way that we were able to jump over the damaged circuitry in the retina to get to the retina &apos;s output cells , we can jump over the damaged circuitry in the cochlea to get the auditory nerve , or jump over damaged areas in the cortex , in the motor cortex , to bridge the gap produced by a stroke .
I just want to end with a simple message that understanding the code is really , really important , and if we can understand the code , the language of the brain , things become possible that didn &apos;t seem obviously possible before . Thank you .

What aspects of religion should atheists adopt ? Alain de Botton suggests a &quot; religion for atheists &quot; -- call it Atheism 2.0 -- that incorporates religious forms and traditions to satisfy our human need for connection , ritual and transcendence .

Alain de Botton : Atheism 2.0
One of the most common ways of dividing the world is into those who believe and those who don &apos;t -- into the religious and the atheists .
And for the last decade or so , it &apos;s been quite clear what being an atheist means .
There have been some very vocal atheists who &apos;ve pointed out , not just that religion is wrong , but that it &apos;s ridiculous .
These people , many of whom have lived in North Oxford , have argued -- they &apos;ve argued that believing in God is akin to believing in fairies and essentially that the whole thing is a childish game .
Now I think it &apos;s too easy .
I think it &apos;s too easy to dismiss the whole of religion that way .
And it &apos;s as easy as shooting fish in a barrel .
And what I &apos;d like to inaugurate today is a new way of being an atheist -- if you like , a new version of atheism we could call Atheism 2.0 .
Now what is Atheism 2.0 ?
Well it starts from a very basic premise : of course , there &apos;s no God .
Of course , there are no deities or supernatural spirits or angels , etc .
Now let &apos;s move on ; that &apos;s not the end of the story , that &apos;s the very , very beginning .
I &apos;m interested in the kind of constituency that thinks something along these lines : that thinks , &quot; I can &apos;t believe in any of this stuff .
I can &apos;t believe in the doctrines .
I don &apos;t think these doctrines are right .
But , &quot; a very important but , &quot; I love Christmas carols .
I really like the art of Mantegna .
I really like looking at old churches .
I really like turning the pages of the Old Testament . &quot;
Whatever it may be , you know the kind of thing I &apos;m talking about -- people who are attracted to the ritualistic side , the moralistic , communal side of religion , but can &apos;t bear the doctrine .
Until now , these people have faced a rather unpleasant choice .
It &apos;s almost as though either you accept the doctrine and then you can have all the nice stuff , or you reject the doctrine and you &apos;re living in some kind of spiritual wasteland under the guidance of CNN and Walmart .
So that &apos;s a sort of tough choice .
I don &apos;t think we have to make that choice .
I think there is an alternative .
I think there are ways -- and I &apos;m being both very respectful and completely impious -- of stealing from religions .
If you don &apos;t believe in a religion , there &apos;s nothing wrong with picking and mixing , with taking out the best sides of religion .
And for me , atheism 2.0 is about both , as I say , a respectful and an impious way of going through religions and saying , &quot; What here could we use ? &quot;
The secular world is full of holes .
We have secularized badly , I would argue .
And a thorough study of religion could give us all sorts of insights into areas of life that are not going too well .
And I &apos;d like to run through a few of these today .
I &apos;d like to kick off by looking at education .
Now education is a field the secular world really believes in .
When we think about how we &apos;re going to make the world a better place , we think education ; that &apos;s where we put a lot of money .
Education is going to give us , not only commercial skills , industrial skills , it &apos;s also going to make us better people .
You know the kind of thing a commencement address is , and graduation ceremonies , those lyrical claims that education , the process of education -- particularly higher education -- will make us into nobler and better human beings .
That &apos;s a lovely idea .
Interesting where it came from .
In the early 19th century , church attendance in Western Europe started sliding down very , very sharply , and people panicked .
They asked themselves the following question .
They said , where are people going to find the morality , where are they going to find guidance , and where are they going to find sources of consolation ?
And influential voices came up with one answer .
They said culture .
It &apos;s to culture that we should look for guidance , for consolation , for morality .
Let &apos;s look to the plays of Shakespeare , the dialogues of Plato , the novels of Jane Austen .
In there , we &apos;ll find a lot of the truths that we might previously have found in the Gospel of Saint John .
Now I think that &apos;s a very beautiful idea and a very true idea .
They wanted to replace scripture with culture .
And that &apos;s a very plausible idea .
It &apos;s also an idea that we have forgotten .
If you went to a top university -- let &apos;s say you went to Harvard or Oxford or Cambridge -- and you said , &quot; I &apos;ve come here because I &apos;m in search of morality , guidance and consolation ; I want to know how to live , &quot; they would show you the way to the insane asylum .
This is simply not what our grandest and best institutes of higher learning are in the business of .
Why ? They don &apos;t think we need it .
They don &apos;t think we are in an urgent need of assistance .
They see us as adults , rational adults .
What we need is information .
We need data , we don &apos;t need help .
Now religions start from a very different place indeed .
All religions , all major religions , at various points call us children .
And like children , they believe that we are in severe need of assistance .
We &apos;re only just holding it together .
Perhaps this is just me , maybe you .
But anyway , we &apos;re only just holding it together .
And we need help . Of course , we need help .
And so we need guidance and we need didactic learning .
You know , in the 18th century in the U.K. , the greatest preacher , greatest religious preacher , was a man called John Wesley , who went up and down this country delivering sermons , advising people how they could live .
He delivered sermons on the duties of parents to their children and children to their parents , the duties of the rich to the poor and the poor to the rich .
He was trying to tell people how they should live through the medium of sermons , the classic medium of delivery of religions .
Now we &apos;ve given up with the idea of sermons .
If you said to a modern liberal individualist , &quot; Hey , how about a sermon ? &quot;
they &apos;d go , &quot; No , no . I don &apos;t need one of those .
I &apos;m an independent , individual person . &quot;
What &apos;s the difference between a sermon and our modern , secular mode of delivery , the lecture ?
Well a sermon wants to change your life and a lecture wants to give you a bit of information .
And I think we need to get back to that sermon tradition .
The tradition of sermonizing is hugely valuable , because we are in need of guidance , morality and consolation -- and religions know that .
Another point about education : we tend to believe in the modern secular world that if you tell someone something once , they &apos;ll remember it .
Sit them in a classroom , tell them about Plato at the age of 20 , send them out for a career in management consultancy for 40 years , and that lesson will stick with them .
Religions go , &quot; Nonsense .
You need to keep repeating the lesson 10 times a day .
So get on your knees and repeat it . &quot;
That &apos;s what all religions tell us : &quot; Get on you knees and repeat it 10 or 20 or 15 times a day . &quot;
Otherwise our minds are like sieves .
So religions are cultures of repetition .
They circle the great truths again and again and again .
We associate repetition with boredom .
&quot; Give us the new , &quot; we &apos;re always saying .
&quot; The new is better than the old . &quot;
If I said to you , &quot; Okay , we &apos;re not going to have new TED .
We &apos;re just going to run through all the old ones and watch them five times because they &apos;re so true .
We &apos;re going to watch Elizabeth Gilbert five times because what she says is so clever , &quot; you &apos;d feel cheated .
Not so if you &apos;re adopting a religious mindset .
The other things that religions do is to arrange time .
All the major religions give us calendars .
What is a calendar ?
A calendar is a way of making sure that across the year you will bump into certain very important ideas .
In the Catholic chronology , Catholic calendar , at the end of March you will think about St. Jerome and his qualities of humility and goodness and his generosity to the poor .
You won &apos;t do that by accident ; you will do that because you are guided to do that .
Now we don &apos;t think that way .
In the secular world we think , &quot; If an idea is important , I &apos;ll bump into it .
I &apos;ll just come across it . &quot;
Nonsense , says the religious world view .
Religious view says we need calendars , we need to structure time , we need to synchronize encounters .
This comes across also in the way in which religions set up rituals around important feelings .
Take the Moon . It &apos;s really important to look at the Moon .
You know , when you look at the Moon , you think , &quot; I &apos;m really small . What are my problems ? &quot;
It sets things into perspective , etc . , etc .
We should all look at the Moon a bit more often . We don &apos;t .
Why don &apos;t we ? Well there &apos;s nothing to tell us , &quot; Look at the Moon . &quot;
But if you &apos;re a Zen Buddhist in the middle of September , you will be ordered out of your home , made to stand on a canonical platform and made to celebrate the festival of Tsukimi , where you will be given poems to read in honor of the Moon and the passage of time and the frailty of life that it should remind us of .
You &apos;ll be handed rice cakes .
And the Moon and the reflection on the Moon will have a secure place in your heart .
That &apos;s very good .
The other thing that religions are really aware of is : speak well -- I &apos;m not doing a very good job of this here -- but oratory , oratory is absolutely key to religions .
In the secular world , you can come through the university system and be a lousy speaker and still have a great career .
But the religious world doesn &apos;t think that way .
What you &apos;re saying needs to be backed up by a really convincing way of saying it .
So if you go to an African American Pentecostalist church in the American South and you listen to how they talk , my goodness , they talk well .
After every convincing point , people will go , &quot; Amen , amen , amen . &quot;
At the end of a really rousing paragraph , they &apos;ll all stand up , and they &apos;ll go , &quot; Thank you Jesus , thank you Christ , thank you Savior . &quot;
If we were doing it like they do it -- let &apos;s not do it , but if we were to do it -- I would tell you something like , &quot; Culture should replace scripture . &quot;
And you would go , &quot; Amen , amen , amen . &quot;
And at the end of my talk , you would all stand up and you would go , &quot; Thank you Plato , thank you Shakespeare , thank you Jane Austen . &quot;
And we &apos;d know that we had a real rhythm going .
All right , all right . We &apos;re getting there . We &apos;re getting there .
The other thing that religions know is we &apos;re not just brains , we are also bodies .
And when they teach us a lesson , they do it via the body .
So for example , take the Jewish idea of forgiveness .
Jews are very interested in forgiveness and how we should start anew and start afresh .
They don &apos;t just deliver us sermons on this .
They don &apos;t just give us books or words about this .
They tell us to have a bath .
So in Orthodox Jewish communities , every Friday you go to a Mikveh .
You immerse yourself in the water , and a physical action backs up a philosophical idea .
We don &apos;t tend to do that .
Our ideas are in one area and our behavior with our bodies is in another .
Religions are fascinating in the way they try and combine the two .
Let &apos;s look at art now .
Now art is something that in the secular world , we think very highly of . We think art is really , really important .
A lot of our surplus wealth goes to museums , etc .
We sometimes hear it said that museums are our new cathedrals , or our new churches .
You &apos;ve heard that saying .
Now I think that the potential is there , but we &apos;ve completely let ourselves down .
And the reason we &apos;ve let ourselves down is that we &apos;re not properly studying how religions handle art .
The two really bad ideas that are hovering in the modern world that inhibit our capacity to draw strength from art : The first idea is that art should be for art &apos;s sake -- a ridiculous idea -- an idea that art should live in a hermetic bubble and should not try to do anything with this troubled world .
I couldn &apos;t disagree more .
The other thing that we believe is that art shouldn &apos;t explain itself , that artists shouldn &apos;t say what they &apos;re up to , because if they said it , it might destroy the spell and we might find it too easy .
That &apos;s why a very common feeling when you &apos;re in a museum -- let &apos;s admit it -- is , &quot; I don &apos;t know what this is about . &quot;
But if we &apos;re serious people , we don &apos;t admit to that .
But that feeling of puzzlement is structural to contemporary art .
Now religions have a much saner attitude to art .
They have no trouble telling us what art is about .
Art is about two things in all the major faiths .
Firstly , it &apos;s trying to remind you of what there is to love .
And secondly , it &apos;s trying to remind you of what there is to fear and to hate .
And that &apos;s what art is .
Art is a visceral encounter with the most important ideas of your faith .
So as you walk around a church , or a mosque or a cathedral , what you &apos;re trying to imbibe , what you &apos;re imbibing is , through your eyes , through your senses , truths that have otherwise come to you through your mind .
Essentially it &apos;s propaganda .
Rembrandt is a propagandist in the Christian view .
Now the word &quot; propaganda &quot; sets off alarm bells .
We think of Hitler , we think of Stalin . Don &apos;t , necessarily .
Propaganda is a manner of being didactic in honor of something .
And if that thing is good , there &apos;s no problem with it at all .
My view is that museums should take a leaf out of the book of religions .
And they should make sure that when you walk into a museum -- if I was a museum curator , I would make a room for love , a room for generosity .
All works of art are talking to us about things .
And if we were able to arrange spaces where we could come across works where we would be told , use these works of art to cement these ideas in your mind , we would get a lot more out of art .
Art would pick up the duty that it used to have and that we &apos;ve neglected because of certain mis-founded ideas .
Art should be one of the tools by which we improve our society .
Art should be didactic .
Let &apos;s think of something else .
The people in the modern world , in the secular world , who are interested in matters of the spirit , in matters of the mind , in higher soul-like concerns , tend to be isolated individuals .
They &apos;re poets , they &apos;re philosophers , they &apos;re photographers , they &apos;re filmmakers .
And they tend to be on their own .
They &apos;re our cottage industries . They are vulnerable , single people .
And they get depressed and they get sad on their own .
And they don &apos;t really change much .
Now think about religions , think about organized religions .
What do organized religions do ?
They group together , they form institutions .
And that has all sorts of advantages .
First of all , scale , might .
The Catholic Church pulled in 97 billion dollars last year according to the Wall Street Journal .
These are massive machines .
They &apos;re collaborative , they &apos;re branded , they &apos;re multinational , and they &apos;re highly disciplined .
These are all very good qualities .
We recognize them in relation to corporations .
And corporations are very like religions in many ways , except they &apos;re right down at the bottom of the pyramid of needs .
They &apos;re selling us shoes and cars .
Whereas the people who are selling us the higher stuff -- the therapists , the poets -- are on their own and they have no power , they have no might .
So religions are the foremost example of an institution that is fighting for the things of the mind .
Now we may not agree with what religions are trying to teach us , but we can admire the institutional way in which they &apos;re doing it .
Books alone , books written by lone individuals , are not going to change anything .
We need to group together .
If you want to change the world , you have to group together , you have to be collaborative .
And that &apos;s what religions do .
They are multinational , as I say , they are branded , they have a clear identity , so they don &apos;t get lost in a busy world .
That &apos;s something we can learn from .
I want to conclude .
Really what I want to say is for many of you who are operating in a range of different fields , there is something to learn from the example of religion -- even if you don &apos;t believe any of it .
If you &apos;re involved in anything that &apos;s communal , that involves lots of people getting together , there are things for you in religion .
If you &apos;re involved , say , in a travel industry in any way , look at pilgrimage .
Look very closely at pilgrimage .
We haven &apos;t begun to scratch the surface of what travel could be because we haven &apos;t looked at what religions do with travel .
If you &apos;re in the art world , look at the example of what religions are doing with art .
And if you &apos;re an educator in any way , again , look at how religions are spreading ideas .
You may not agree with the ideas , but my goodness , they &apos;re highly effective mechanisms for doing so .
So really my concluding point is you may not agree with religion , but at the end of the day , religions are so subtle , so complicated , so intelligent in many ways that they &apos;re not fit to be abandoned to the religious alone ; they &apos;re for all of us .
Thank you very much .
Now this is actually a courageous talk , because you &apos;re kind of setting up yourself in some ways to be ridiculed in some quarters .
You can get shot by both sides .
You can get shot by the hard-headed atheists , and you can get shot by those who fully believe .
Incoming missiles from North Oxford at any moment .
Indeed .
But you left out one aspect of religion that a lot of people might say your agenda could borrow from , which is this sense -- that &apos;s actually probably the most important thing to anyone who &apos;s religious -- of spiritual experience , of some kind of connection with something that &apos;s bigger than you are .
Is there any room for that experience in Atheism 2.0 ?
Absolutely . I , like many of you , meet people who say things like , &quot; But isn &apos;t there something bigger than us , something else ? &quot;
And I say , &quot; Of course . &quot; And they say , &quot; So aren &apos;t you sort of religious ? &quot;
And I go , &quot; No . &quot; Why does that sense of mystery , that sense of the dizzying scale of the universe , need to be accompanied by a mystical feeling ?
Science and just observation gives us that feeling without it , so I don &apos;t feel the need .
The universe is large and we are tiny , without the need for further religious superstructure .
So one can have so-called spiritual moments without belief in the spirit .
Actually , let me just ask a question .
How many people here would say that religion is important to them ?
Is there an equivalent process by which there &apos;s a sort of bridge between what you &apos;re talking about and what you would say to them ?
I would say that there are many , many gaps in secular life and these can be plugged .
It &apos;s not as though , as I try to suggest , it &apos;s not as though either you have religion and then you have to accept all sorts of things , or you don &apos;t have religion and then you &apos;re cut off from all these very good things .
It &apos;s so sad that we constantly say , &quot; I don &apos;t believe so I can &apos;t have community , so I &apos;m cut off from morality , so I can &apos;t go on a pilgrimage . &quot;
One wants to say , &quot; Nonsense . Why not ? &quot;
And that &apos;s really the spirit of my talk .
There &apos;s so much we can absorb .
Atheism shouldn &apos;t cut itself off from the rich sources of religion .
It seems to me that there &apos;s plenty of people in the TED community who are atheists .
But probably most people in the community certainly don &apos;t think that religion is going away any time soon and want to find the language to have a constructive dialogue and to feel like we can actually talk to each other and at least share some things in common .
Are we foolish to be optimistic about the possibility of a world where , instead of religion being the great rallying cry of divide and war , that there could be bridging ?
No , we need to be polite about differences .
Politeness is a much-overlooked virtue .
It &apos;s seen as hypocrisy .
But we need to get to a stage when you &apos;re an atheist and someone says , &quot; Well you know , I did pray the other day , &quot; you politely ignore it .
You move on .
Because you &apos;ve agreed on 90 percent of things , because you have a shared view on so many things , and you politely differ .
And I think that &apos;s what the religious wars of late have ignored .
They &apos;ve ignored the possibility of harmonious disagreement .
And finally , does this new thing that you &apos;re proposing that &apos;s not a religion but something else , does it need a leader , and are you volunteering to be the pope ?
Well , one thing that we &apos;re all very suspicious of is individual leaders .
It doesn &apos;t need it .
What I &apos;ve tried to lay out is a framework and I &apos;m hoping that people can just fill it in .
I &apos;ve sketched a sort of broad framework .
But wherever you are , as I say , if you &apos;re in the travel industry , do that travel bit .
If you &apos;re in the communal industry , look at religion and do the communal bit .
So it &apos;s a wiki project .
Alain , thank you for sparking many conversations later .

A.J. Jacobs : How healthy living nearly killed me
I &apos;ve spent the last decade subjecting myself to pain and humiliation , hopefully for a good cause , which is self-improvement .
And I &apos;ve done this in three parts .
So first I started with the mind .
And I decided to try to get smarter by reading the entire Encyclopedia Britannica from A to Z -- or , more precisely , from &quot; a-ak &quot; to &quot; Zywiec . &quot;
And here &apos;s a little image of that .
And this was an amazing year .
It was really a fascinating journey .
It was painful at times , especially for those around me .
My wife started to fine me one dollar for every irrelevant fact I inserted into conversation .
So it had its downsides .
But after that , I decided to work on the spirit .
As I mentioned last year , I grew up with no religion at all .
I &apos;m Jewish , but I &apos;m Jewish in the same way the Olive Garden is Italian .
Not really .
But I decided to learn about the Bible and my heritage by actually diving in and trying to live it and immerse myself in it .
So I decided to follow all the rules of the Bible .
And from the Ten Commandments to growing my beard -- because Leviticus says you cannot shave .
So this is what I looked like by the end .
Thank you for that reaction .
I look a little like Moses , or Ted Kaczynski .
I got both of them .
So there was the topiary there .
And there &apos;s the sheep .
Now the final part of the trilogy was I wanted to focus on the body and try to be the healthiest person I could be , the healthiest person alive .
So that &apos;s what I &apos;ve been doing the last couple of years .
And I just finished a couple of months ago .
And I have to say , thank God .
Because living so healthily was killing me .
It was so overwhelming , because the amount of things you have to do , it &apos;s just mind-boggling .
I was listening to all the experts and talking to sort of a board of medical advisers .
And they were telling me all the things I had to do .
I had to eat right , exercise , meditate , pet dogs , because that lowers the blood pressure .
I wrote the book on a treadmill , and it took me about a thousand miles to write the book .
I had to put on sunscreen .
This was no small feat , because if you listen to dermatologists , they say that you should have a shot glass full of sunscreen .
And you have to reapply it every two to four hours .
So I think half of my book advance went into sunscreen .
I was like a glazed doughnut for most of the year .
There was the washing of hands .
I had to do that properly .
And my immunologist told me that I should also wipe down all of the remote controls and iPhones in my house , because those are just orgies of germs .
So that took a lot of time .
I also tried to be the safest person I could be , because that &apos;s a part of health .
I was inspired by the Danish Safety Council .
They started a public campaign that says , &quot; A walking helmet is a good helmet . &quot;
So they believe you should not just wear helmets for biking , but also for walking around .
And you can see there they &apos;re shopping with their helmets .
Well yeah , I tried that .
Now it &apos;s a little extreme , I admit .
But if you think about this , this is actually -- the &quot; Freakonomics &quot; authors wrote about this -- that more people die on a per mile basis from drunk walking than from drunk driving .
So something to think about tonight if you &apos;ve had a couple .
So I finished , and it was a success in a sense .
All of the markers went in the right direction .
My cholesterol went down , I lost weight , my wife stopped telling me that I looked pregnant .
So that was nice .
And it was successful overall .
But I also learned that I was too healthy , and that was unhealthy .
I was so focused on doing all these things that I was neglecting my friends and family .
And as Dan Buettner can tell you , having a strong social network is so crucial to our health .
So I finished .
And I kind of went overboard on the week after the project was over .
I went to the dark side , and I just indulged myself .
It was like something out of Caligula .
Without the sex part .
Because I have three young kids , so that wasn &apos;t happening .
But the over-eating and over-drinking , definitely .
And I finally have stabilized .
So now I &apos;m back to adopting many -- not all ; I don &apos;t wear a helmet anymore -- but dozens of healthy behaviors that I adopted during my year .
It was really a life-changing project .
And I , of course , don &apos;t have time to go into all of them .
Let me just tell you two really quickly .
The first is -- and this was surprising to me ; I didn &apos;t expect this to come out -- but I live a much quieter life now .
Because we live in such a noisy world .
There &apos;s trains and planes and cars and Bill O &apos;Reilly , he &apos;s very noisy .
And this is a real underestimated , under-appreciated health hazard -- not just because it harms our hearing , which it obviously does , but it actually initiates the fight-or-flight response .
A loud noise will get your fight-or-flight response going .
And this , over the years , can cause real damage , cardiovascular damage .
The World Health Organization just did a big study that they published this year .
And it was done in Europe .
And they estimated that 1.6 million years of healthy living are lost every year in Europe because of noise pollution .
So they think it &apos;s actually very deadly .
And by the way , it &apos;s also terrible for your brain .
It really impairs cognition .
And our Founding Fathers knew about this .
When they wrote the Constitution , they put dirt all over the cobblestones outside the hall so that they could concentrate .
So without noise reduction technology , our country would not exist .
So as a patriot , I felt it was important to -- I wear all the earplugs and the earphones , and it &apos;s really improved my life in a surprising and unexpected way .
And the second point I want to make , the final point , is that -- and it &apos;s actually been a theme of TEDMED -- that joy is so important to your health , that very few of these behaviors will stick with me unless there &apos;s some sense of pleasure and joy in them .
And just to give you one instance of this : food .
The junk food industry is really great at pressing our pleasure buttons and figuring out what &apos;s the most pleasurable .
But I think we can use their techniques and apply them to healthy food .
To give just one example , we love crunchiness , mouthfeel .
So I basically have tried to incorporate crunchiness into a lot of my recipes -- throw in some sunflower seeds .
And you can almost trick yourself into thinking you &apos;re eating Doritos .
And it has made me a healthier person .
So that is it .
The book about it comes out in April .
It &apos;s called &quot; Drop Dead Healthy . &quot;
And I hope that I don &apos;t get sick during the book tour .
That &apos;s my greatest hope .
So thank you very much .

We have no ways to directly observe molecules and what they do -- Drew Berry wants to change that . At TEDxSydney he shows his scientifically accurate animations that help researchers see unseeable processes within our own cells .

Drew Berry : Animations of unseeable biology
What I &apos;m going to show you are the astonishing molecular machines that create the living fabric of your body .
Now molecules are really , really tiny .
And by tiny , I mean really .
They &apos;re smaller than a wavelength of light , so we have no way to directly observe them .
But through science , we do have a fairly good idea of what &apos;s going on down at the molecular scale .
So what we can do is actually tell you about the molecules , but we don &apos;t really have a direct way of showing you the molecules .
One way around this is to draw pictures .
And this idea is actually nothing new .
Scientists have always created pictures as part of their thinking and discovery process .
They draw pictures of what they &apos;re observing with their eyes , through technology like telescopes and microscopes , and also what they &apos;re thinking about in their minds .
I picked two well-known examples , because they &apos;re very well-known for expressing science through art .
And I start with Galileo who used the world &apos;s first telescope to look at the Moon .
And he transformed our understanding of the Moon .
The perception in the 17th century was the Moon was a perfect heavenly sphere .
But what Galileo saw was a rocky , barren world , which he expressed through his watercolor painting .
Another scientist with very big ideas , the superstar of biology , is Charles Darwin .
And with this famous entry in his notebook , he begins in the top left-hand corner with , &quot; I think , &quot; and then sketches out the first tree of life , which is his perception of how all the species , all living things on Earth , are connected through evolutionary history -- the origin of species through natural selection and divergence from an ancestral population .
Even as a scientist , I used to go to lectures by molecular biologists and find them completely incomprehensible , with all the fancy technical language and jargon that they would use in describing their work , until I encountered the artworks of David Goodsell , who is a molecular biologist at the Scripps Institute .
And his pictures , everything &apos;s accurate and it &apos;s all to scale .
And his work illuminated for me what the molecular world inside us is like .
So this is a transection through blood .
In the top left-hand corner , you &apos;ve got this yellow-green area .
The yellow-green area is the fluids of blood , which is mostly water , but it &apos;s also antibodies , sugars , hormones , that kind of thing .
And the red region is a slice into a red blood cell .
And those red molecules are hemoglobin .
They are actually red ; that &apos;s what gives blood its color .
And hemoglobin acts as a molecular sponge to soak up the oxygen in your lungs and then carry it to other parts of the body .
I was very much inspired by this image many years ago , and I wondered whether we could use computer graphics to represent the molecular world .
What would it look like ?
And that &apos;s how I really began . So let &apos;s begin .
This is DNA in its classic double helix form .
And it &apos;s from X-ray crystallography , so it &apos;s an accurate model of DNA .
If we unwind the double helix and unzip the two strands , you see these things that look like teeth .
Those are the letters of genetic code , the 25,000 genes you &apos;ve got written in your DNA .
This is what they typically talk about -- the genetic code -- this is what they &apos;re talking about .
But I want to talk about a different aspect of DNA science , and that is the physical nature of DNA .
It &apos;s these two strands that run in opposite directions for reasons I can &apos;t go into right now .
But they physically run in opposite directions , which creates a number of complications for your living cells , as you &apos;re about to see , most particularly when DNA is being copied .
And so what I &apos;m about to show you is an accurate representation of the actual DNA replication machine that &apos;s occurring right now inside your body , at least 2002 biology .
So DNA &apos;s entering the production line from the left-hand side , and it hits this collection , these miniature biochemical machines , that are pulling apart the DNA strand and making an exact copy .
So DNA comes in and hits this blue , doughnut-shaped structure and it &apos;s ripped apart into its two strands .
One strand can be copied directly , and you can see these things spooling off to the bottom there .
But things aren &apos;t so simple for the other strand because it must be copied backwards .
So it &apos;s thrown out repeatedly in these loops and copied one section at a time , creating two new DNA molecules .
Now you have billions of this machine right now working away inside you , copying your DNA with exquisite fidelity .
It &apos;s an accurate representation , and it &apos;s pretty much at the correct speed for what is occurring inside you .
I &apos;ve left out error correction and a bunch of other things .
This was work from a number of years ago .
Thank you .
This is work from a number of years ago , but what I &apos;ll show you next is updated science , it &apos;s updated technology .
So again , we begin with DNA .
And it &apos;s jiggling and wiggling there because of the surrounding soup of molecules , which I &apos;ve stripped away so you can see something .
DNA is about two nanometers across , which is really quite tiny .
But in each one of your cells , each strand of DNA is about 30 to 40 million nanometers long .
So to keep the DNA organized and regulate access to the genetic code , it &apos;s wrapped around these purple proteins -- or I &apos;ve labeled them purple here .
It &apos;s packaged up and bundled up .
All this field of view is a single strand of DNA .
This huge package of DNA is called a chromosome .
And we &apos;ll come back to chromosomes in a minute .
We &apos;re pulling out , we &apos;re zooming out , out through a nuclear pore , which is the gateway to this compartment that holds all the DNA called the nucleus .
All of this field of view is about a semester &apos;s worth of biology , and I &apos;ve got seven minutes .
So we &apos;re not going to be able to do that today ?
No , I &apos;m being told , &quot; No . &quot;
This is the way a living cell looks down a light microscope .
And it &apos;s been filmed under time-lapse , which is why you can see it moving .
The nuclear envelope breaks down .
These sausage-shaped things are the chromosomes , and we &apos;ll focus on them .
They go through this very striking motion that is focused on these little red spots .
When the cell feels it &apos;s ready to go , it rips apart the chromosome .
One set of DNA goes to one side , the other side gets the other set of DNA -- identical copies of DNA .
And then the cell splits down the middle .
And again , you have billions of cells undergoing this process right now inside of you .
Now we &apos;re going to rewind and just focus on the chromosomes and look at its structure and describe it .
So again , here we are at that equator moment .
The chromosomes line up .
And if we isolate just one chromosome , we &apos;re going to pull it out and have a look at its structure .
So this is one of the biggest molecular structures that you have , at least as far as we &apos;ve discovered so far inside of us .
So this is a single chromosome .
And you have two strands of DNA in each chromosome .
One is bundled up into one sausage .
The other strand is bundled up into the other sausage .
These things that look like whiskers that are sticking out from either side are the dynamic scaffolding of the cell .
They &apos;re called mircrotubules . That name &apos;s not important .
But what we &apos;re going to focus on is this red region -- I &apos;ve labeled it red here -- and it &apos;s the interface between the dynamic scaffolding and the chromosomes .
It is obviously central to the movement of the chromosomes .
We have no idea really as to how it &apos;s achieving that movement .
We &apos;ve been studying this thing they call the kinetochore for over a hundred years with intense study , and we &apos;re still just beginning to discover what it &apos;s all about .
It is made up of about 200 different types of proteins , thousands of proteins in total .
It is a signal broadcasting system .
It broadcasts through chemical signals telling the rest of the cell when it &apos;s ready , when it feels that everything is aligned and ready to go for the separation of the chromosomes .
It is able to couple onto the growing and shrinking microtubules .
It &apos;s involved with the growing of the microtubules , and it &apos;s able to transiently couple onto them .
It &apos;s also an attention sensing system .
It &apos;s able to feel when the cell is ready , when the chromosome is correctly positioned .
It &apos;s turning green here because it feels that everything is just right .
And you &apos;ll see , there &apos;s this one little last bit that &apos;s still remaining red .
And it &apos;s walked away down the microtubules .
That is the signal broadcasting system sending out the stop signal .
And it &apos;s walked away . I mean , it &apos;s that mechanical .
It &apos;s molecular clockwork .
This is how you work at the molecular scale .
So with a little bit of molecular eye candy , we &apos;ve got kinesins , which are the orange ones .
They &apos;re little molecular courier molecules walking one way .
And here are the dynein . They &apos;re carrying that broadcasting system .
And they &apos;ve got their long legs so they can step around obstacles and so on .
So again , this is all derived accurately from the science .
The problem is we can &apos;t show it to you any other way .
Exploring at the frontier of science , at the frontier of human understanding , is mind-blowing .
Discovering this stuff is certainly a pleasurable incentive to work in science .
But most medical researchers -- discovering the stuff is simply steps along the path to the big goals , which are to eradicate disease , to eliminate the suffering and the misery that disease causes and to lift people out of poverty .
Thank you .

Annie Murphy Paul : What we learn before we &apos;re born
My subject today is learning .
And in that spirit , I want to spring on you all a pop quiz .
Ready ?
When does learning begin ?
Now as you ponder that question , maybe you &apos;re thinking about the first day of preschool or kindergarten , the first time that kids are in a classroom with a teacher .
Or maybe you &apos;ve called to mind the toddler phase when children are learning how to walk and talk and use a fork .
Maybe you &apos;ve encountered the Zero-to-Three movement , which asserts that the most important years for learning are the earliest ones .
And so your answer to my question would be : Learning begins at birth .
Well today I want to present to you an idea that may be surprising and may even seem implausible , but which is supported by the latest evidence from psychology and biology .
And that is that some of the most important learning we ever do happens before we &apos;re born , while we &apos;re still in the womb .
Now I &apos;m a science reporter .
I write books and magazine articles .
And I &apos;m also a mother .
And those two roles came together for me in a book that I wrote called &quot; Origins . &quot;
&quot; Origins &quot; is a report from the front lines of an exciting new field called fetal origins .
Fetal origins is a scientific discipline that emerged just about two decades ago , and it &apos;s based on the theory that our health and well-being throughout our lives is crucially affected by the nine months we spend in the womb .
Now this theory was of more than just intellectual interest to me .
I was myself pregnant while I was doing the research for the book .
And one of the most fascinating insights I took from this work is that we &apos;re all learning about the world even before we enter it .
When we hold our babies for the first time , we might imagine that they &apos;re clean slates , unmarked by life , when in fact , they &apos;ve already been shaped by us and by the particular world we live in .
Today I want to share with you some of the amazing things that scientists are discovering about what fetuses learn while they &apos;re still in their mothers &apos; bellies .
First of all , they learn the sound of their mothers &apos; voices .
Because sounds from the outside world have to travel through the mother &apos;s abdominal tissue and through the amniotic fluid that surrounds the fetus , the voices fetuses hear , starting around the fourth month of gestation , are muted and muffled .
One researcher says that they probably sound a lot like the the voice of Charlie Brown &apos;s teacher in the old &quot; Peanuts &quot; cartoon .
But the pregnant woman &apos;s own voice reverberates through her body , reaching the fetus much more readily .
And because the fetus is with her all the time , it hears her voice a lot .
Once the baby &apos;s born , it recognizes her voice and it prefers listening to her voice over anyone else &apos;s .
How can we know this ?
Newborn babies can &apos;t do much , but one thing they &apos;re really good at is sucking .
Researchers take advantage of this fact by rigging up two rubber nipples , so that if a baby sucks on one , it hears a recording of its mother &apos;s voice on a pair of headphones , and if it sucks on the other nipple , it hears a recording of a female stranger &apos;s voice .
Babies quickly show their preference by choosing the first one .
Scientists also take advantage of the fact that babies will slow down their sucking when something interests them and resume their fast sucking when they get bored .
This is how researchers discovered that , after women repeatedly read aloud a section of Dr. Seuss &apos; &quot; The Cat in the Hat &quot; while they were pregnant , their newborn babies recognized that passage when they hear it outside the womb .
My favorite experiment of this kind is the one that showed that the babies of women who watched a certain soap opera every day during pregnancy recognized the theme song of that show once they were born .
So fetuses are even learning about the particular language that &apos;s spoken in the world that they &apos;ll be born into .
A study published last year found that from birth , from the moment of birth , babies cry in the accent of their mother &apos;s native language .
French babies cry on a rising note while German babies end on a falling note , imitating the melodic contours of those languages .
Now why would this kind of fetal learning be useful ?
It may have evolved to aid the baby &apos;s survival .
From the moment of birth , the baby responds most to the voice of the person who is most likely to care for it -- its mother .
It even makes its cries sound like the mother &apos;s language , which may further endear the baby to the mother , and which may give the baby a head start in the critical task of learning how to understand and speak its native language .
But it &apos;s not just sounds that fetuses are learning about in utero .
It &apos;s also tastes and smells .
By seven months of gestation , the fetus &apos; taste buds are fully developed , and its olfactory receptors , which allow it to smell , are functioning .
The flavors of the food a pregnant woman eats find their way into the amniotic fluid , which is continuously swallowed by the fetus .
Babies seem to remember and prefer these tastes once they &apos;re out in the world .
In one experiment , a group of pregnant women was asked to drink a lot of carrot juice during their third trimester of pregnancy , while another group of pregnant women drank only water .
Six months later , the women &apos;s infants were offered cereal mixed with carrot juice , and their facial expressions were observed while they ate it .
The offspring of the carrot juice drinking women ate more carrot-flavored cereal , and from the looks of it , they seemed to enjoy it more .
A sort of French version of this experiment was carried out in Dijon , France where researchers found that mothers who consumed food and drink flavored with licorice-flavored anise during pregnancy showed a preference for anise on their first day of life , and again , when they were tested later , on their fourth day of life .
Babies whose mothers did not eat anise during pregnancy showed a reaction that translated roughly as &quot; yuck . &quot;
What this means is that fetuses are effectively being taught by their mothers about what is safe and good to eat .
Fetuses are also being taught about the particular culture that they &apos;ll be joining through one of culture &apos;s most powerful expressions , which is food .
They &apos;re being introduced to the characteristic flavors and spices of their culture &apos;s cuisine even before birth .
Now it turns out that fetuses are learning even bigger lessons .
But before I get to that , I want to address something that you may be wondering about .
The notion of fetal learning may conjure up for you attempts to enrich the fetus -- like playing Mozart through headphones placed on a pregnant belly .
But actually , the nine-month-long process of molding and shaping that goes on in the womb is a lot more visceral and consequential than that .
Much of what a pregnant woman encounters in her daily life -- the air she breathes , the food and drink she consumes , the chemicals she &apos;s exposed to , even the emotions she feels -- are shared in some fashion with her fetus .
They make up a mix of influences as individual and idiosyncratic as the woman herself .
The fetus incorporates these offerings into its own body , makes them part of its flesh and blood .
And often it does something more .
It treats these maternal contributions as information , as what I like to call biological postcards from the world outside .
So what a fetus is learning about in utero is not Mozart &apos;s &quot; Magic Flute &quot; but answers to questions much more critical to its survival .
Will it be born into a world of abundance or scarcity ?
Will it be safe and protected , or will it face constant dangers and threats ?
Will it live a long , fruitful life or a short , harried one ?
The pregnant woman &apos;s diet and stress level in particular provide important clues to prevailing conditions like a finger lifted to the wind .
The resulting tuning and tweaking of a fetus &apos; brain and other organs are part of what give us humans our enormous flexibility , our ability to thrive in a huge variety of environments , from the country to the city , from the tundra to the desert .
To conclude , I want to tell you two stories about how mothers teach their children about the world even before they &apos;re born .
In the autumn of 1944 , the darkest days of World War II , German troops blockaded Western Holland , turning away all shipments of food .
The opening of the Nazi &apos;s siege was followed by one of the harshest winters in decades -- so cold the water in the canals froze solid .
Soon food became scarce , with many Dutch surviving on just 500 calories a day -- a quarter of what they consumed before the war .
As weeks of deprivation stretched into months , some resorted to eating tulip bulbs .
By the beginning of May , the nation &apos;s carefully rationed food reserve was completely exhausted .
The specter of mass starvation loomed .
And then on May 5th , 1945 , the siege came to a sudden end when Holland was liberated by the Allies .
The &quot; Hunger Winter , &quot; as it came to be known , killed some 10,000 people and weakened thousands more .
But there was another population that was affected -- the 40,000 fetuses in utero during the siege .
Some of the effects of malnutrition during pregnancy were immediately apparent in higher rates of stillbirths , birth defects , low birth weights and infant mortality .
But others wouldn &apos;t be discovered for many years .
Decades after the &quot; Hunger Winter , &quot; researchers documented that people whose mothers were pregnant during the siege have more obesity , more diabetes and more heart disease in later life than individuals who were gestated under normal conditions .
These individuals &apos; prenatal experience of starvation seems to have changed their bodies in myriad ways .
They have higher blood pressure , poorer cholesterol profiles and reduced glucose tolerance -- a precursor of diabetes .
Why would undernutrition in the womb result in disease later ?
One explanation is that fetuses are making the best of a bad situation .
When food is scarce , they divert nutrients towards the really critical organ , the brain , and away from other organs like the heart and liver .
This keeps the fetus alive in the short-term , but the bill comes due later on in life when those other organs , deprived early on , become more susceptible to disease .
But that may not be all that &apos;s going on .
It seems that fetuses are taking cues from the intrauterine environment and tailoring their physiology accordingly .
They &apos;re preparing themselves for the kind of world they will encounter on the other side of the womb .
The fetus adjusts its metabolism and other physiological processes in anticipation of the environment that awaits it .
And the basis of the fetus &apos; prediction is what its mother eats .
The meals a pregnant woman consumes constitute a kind of story , a fairy tale of abundance or a grim chronicle of deprivation .
This story imparts information that the fetus uses to organize its body and its systems -- an adaptation to prevailing circumstances that facilitates its future survival .
Faced with severely limited resources , a smaller-sized child with reduced energy requirements will , in fact , have a better chance of living to adulthood .
The real trouble comes when pregnant women are , in a sense , unreliable narrators , when fetuses are led to expect a world of scarcity and are born instead into a world of plenty .
This is what happened to the children of the Dutch &quot; Hunger Winter . &quot;
And their higher rates of obesity , diabetes and heart disease are the result .
Bodies that were built to hang onto every calorie found themselves swimming in the superfluous calories of the post-war Western diet .
The world they had learned about while in utero was not the same as the world into which they were born .
Here &apos;s another story .
At 8 : 46 a.m. on September 11th , 2001 , there were tens of thousands of people in the vicinity of the World Trade Center in New York -- commuters spilling off trains , waitresses setting tables for the morning rush , brokers already working the phones on Wall Street .
1,700 of these people were pregnant women .
When the planes struck and the towers collapsed , many of these women experienced the same horrors inflicted on other survivors of the disaster -- the overwhelming chaos and confusion , the rolling clouds of potentially toxic dust and debris , the heart-pounding fear for their lives .
About a year after 9 / 11 , researchers examined a group of women who were pregnant when they were exposed to the World Trade Center attack .
In the babies of those women who developed post-traumatic stress syndrome , or PTSD , following their ordeal , researchers discovered a biological marker of susceptibility to PTSD -- an effect that was most pronounced in infants whose mothers experienced the catastrophe in their third trimester .
In other words , the mothers with post-traumatic stress syndrome had passed on a vulnerability to the condition to their children while they were still in utero .
Now consider this : post-traumatic stress syndrome appears to be a reaction to stress gone very wrong , causing its victims tremendous unnecessary suffering .
But there &apos;s another way of thinking about PTSD .
What looks like pathology to us may actually be a useful adaptation in some circumstances .
In a particularly dangerous environment , the characteristic manifestations of PTSD -- a hyper-awareness of one &apos;s surroundings , a quick-trigger response to danger -- could save someone &apos;s life .
The notion that the prenatal transmission of PTSD risk is adaptive is still speculative , but I find it rather poignant .
It would mean that , even before birth , mothers are warning their children that it &apos;s a wild world out there , telling them , &quot; Be careful . &quot;
Let me be clear .
Fetal origins research is not about blaming women for what happens during pregnancy .
It &apos;s about discovering how best to promote the health and well-being of the next generation .
That important effort must include a focus on what fetuses learn during the nine months they spend in the womb .
Learning is one of life &apos;s most essential activities , and it begins much earlier than we ever imagined .
Thank you .

Tan Le : My immigration story
How can I speak in 10 minutes about the bonds of women over three generations , about how the astonishing strength of those bonds took hold in the life of a four-year-old girl huddled with her young sister , her mother and her grandmother for five days and nights in a small boat in the China Sea more than 30 years ago , bonds that took hold in the life of that small girl and never let go -- that small girl now living in San Francisco and speaking to you today ?
This is not a finished story .
It is a jigsaw puzzle still being put together .
Let me tell you about some of the pieces .
Imagine the first piece : a man burning his life &apos;s work .
He is a poet , a playwright , a man whose whole life had been balanced on the single hope of his country &apos;s unity and freedom .
Imagine him as the communists enter Saigon , confronting the fact that his life had been a complete waste .
Words , for so long his friends , now mocked him .
He retreated into silence .
He died broken by history .
He is my grandfather .
I never knew him in real life .
But our lives are much more than our memories .
My grandmother never let me forget his life .
My duty was not to allow it to have been in vain , and my lesson was to learn that , yes , history tried to crush us , but we endured .
The next piece of the jigsaw is of a boat in the early dawn slipping silently out to sea .
My mother , Mai , was 18 when her father died -- already in an arranged marriage , already with two small girls .
For her , life had distilled itself into one task : the escape of her family and a new life in Australia .
It was inconceivable to her that she would not succeed .
So after a four-year saga that defies fiction , a boat slipped out to sea disguised as a fishing vessel .
All the adults knew the risks .
The greatest fear was of pirates , rape and death .
Like most adults on the boat , my mother carried a small bottle of poison .
If we were captured , first my sister and I , then she and my grandmother would drink .
My first memories are from the boat -- the steady beat of the engine , the bow dipping into each wave , the vast and empty horizon .
I don &apos;t remember the pirates who came many times , but were bluffed by the bravado of the men on our boat , or the engine dying and failing to start for six hours .
But I do remember the lights on the oil rig off the Malaysian coast and the young man who collapsed and died , the journey &apos;s end too much for him , and the first apple I tasted , given to me by the men on the rig .
No apple has ever tasted the same .
After three months in a refugee camp , we landed in Melbourne .
And the next piece of the jigsaw is about four women across three generations shaping a new life together .
We settled in Footscray , a working-class suburb whose demographic is layers of immigrants .
Unlike the settled middle-class suburbs , whose existence I was oblivious of , there was no sense of entitlement in Footscray .
The smells from shop doors were from the rest of the world .
And the snippets of halting English were exchanged between people who had one thing in common , they were starting again .
My mother worked on farms , then on a car assembly line , working six days , double shifts .
Somehow she found time to study English and gain IT qualifications .
We were poor .
All the dollars were allocated and extra tuition in English and mathematics was budgeted for regardless of what missed out , which was usually new clothes ; they were always secondhand .
Two pairs of stockings for school , each to hide the holes in the other .
A school uniform down to the ankles , because it had to last for six years .
And there were rare but searing chants of &quot; slit-eye &quot; and the occasional graffiti : &quot; Asian , go home . &quot;
Go home to where ?
Something stiffened inside me .
There was a gathering of resolve and a quiet voice saying , &quot; I will bypass you . &quot;
My mother , my sister and I slept in the same bed .
My mother was exhausted each night , but we told one another about our day and listened to the movements of my grandmother around the house .
My mother suffered from nightmares all about the boat .
And my job was to stay awake until her nightmares came so I could wake her .
She opened a computer store then studied to be a beautician and opened another business .
And the women came with their stories about men who could not make the transition , angry and inflexible , and troubled children caught between two worlds .
Grants and sponsors were sought .
Centers were established .
I lived in parallel worlds .
In one , I was the classic Asian student , relentless in the demands that I made on myself .
In the other , I was enmeshed in lives that were precarious , tragically scarred by violence , drug abuse and isolation .
But so many over the years were helped .
And for that work , when I was a final year law student , I was chosen as the young Australian of the year .
And I was catapulted from one piece of the jigsaw to another , and their edges didn &apos;t fit .
Tan Le , anonymous Footscray resident , was now Tan Le , refugee and social activist , invited to speak in venues she had never heard of and into homes whose existence she could never have imagined .
I didn &apos;t know the protocols .
I didn &apos;t know how to use the cutlery .
I didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
I didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
I wanted to retreat to the routines and comfort of life in an unsung suburb -- a grandmother , a mother and two daughters ending each day as they had for almost 20 years , telling one another the story of their day and falling asleep , the three of us still in the same bed .
I told my mother I couldn &apos;t do it .
She reminded me that I was now the same age she had been when we boarded the boat .
No had never been an option .
&quot; Just do it , &quot; she said , &quot; and don &apos;t be what you &apos;re not . &quot;
So I spoke out on youth unemployment and education and the neglect of the marginalized and the disenfranchised .
And the more candidly I spoke , the more I was asked to speak .
I met people from all walks of life , so many of them doing the thing they loved , living on the frontiers of possibility .
And even though I finished my degree , I realized I could not settle into a career in law .
There had to be another piece of the jigsaw .
And I realized at the same time that it is okay to be an outsider , a recent arrival , new on the scene -- and not just okay , but something to be thankful for , perhaps a gift from the boat .
Because being an insider can so easily mean collapsing the horizons , can so easily mean accepting the presumptions of your province .
I have stepped outside my comfort zone enough now to know that , yes , the world does fall apart , but not in the way that you fear .
Possibilities that would not have been allowed were outrageously encouraged .
There was an energy there , an implacable optimism , a strange mixture of humility and daring .
So I followed my hunches .
I gathered around me a small team of people for whom the label &quot; It can &apos;t be done &quot; was an irresistible challenge .
For a year we were penniless .
At the end of each day , I made a huge pot of soup which we all shared .
We worked well into each night .
Most of our ideas were crazy , but a few were brilliant , and we broke through .
I made the decision to move to the U.S.
after only one trip .
My hunches again .
Three months later I had relocated , and the adventure has continued .
Before I close though , let me tell you about my grandmother .
She grew up at a time when Confucianism was the social norm and the local Mandarin was the person who mattered .
Life hadn &apos;t changed for centuries .
Her father died soon after she was born .
Her mother raised her alone .
At 17 she became the second wife of a Mandarin whose mother beat her .
With no support from her husband , she caused a sensation by taking him to court and prosecuting her own case , and a far greater sensation when she won .
&quot; It can &apos;t be done &quot; was shown to be wrong .
I was taking a shower in a hotel room in Sydney the moment she died 600 miles away in Melbourne .
I looked through the shower screen and saw her standing on the other side .
I knew she had come to say goodbye .
My mother phoned minutes later .
A few days later , we went to a Buddhist temple in Footscray and sat around her casket .
We told her stories and assured her that we were still with her .
At midnight the monk came and told us he had to close the casket .
My mother asked us to feel her hand .
She asked the monk , &quot; Why is it that her hand is so warm and the rest of her is so cold ? &quot;
&quot; Because you have been holding it since this morning , &quot; he said .
&quot; You have not let it go . &quot;
If there is a sinew in our family , it runs through the women .
Given who we were and how life had shaped us , we can now see that the men who might have come into our lives would have thwarted us .
Defeat would have come too easily .
Now I would like to have my own children , and I wonder about the boat .
Who could ever wish it on their own ?
Yet I am afraid of privilege , of ease , of entitlement .
Can I give them a bow in their lives , dipping bravely into each wave , the unperturbed and steady beat of the engine , the vast horizon that guarantees nothing ?
I don &apos;t know .
But if I could give it and still see them safely through , I would .

Mick Ebeling : The invention that unlocked a locked-in artist
I have had the distinct blessing in my life to have worked on a bunch of amazing projects .
But the coolest I ever worked on was around this guy .
This guy &apos;s name is TEMPT .
TEMPT was one of the foremost graffiti artists in the 80s .
And he came up home from a run one day and said , &quot; Dad , my legs are tingling . &quot;
And that was the onset of ALS .
So TEMPT is now completely paralyzed .
He only has use of his eyes .
I was exposed to him .
I have a company that does design and animation , so obviously graffiti is definitely an intricate part of what we admire and respect in the art world .
And so we decided that we were going to sponsor Tony , TEMPT , and his cause .
So I went and met with his brother and father and said , &quot; We &apos;re going to give you this money .
What are you going to do with it ? &quot;
And his brother said , &quot; I just want to be able to talk to Tony again .
I just want to be able to communicate with him and him to be able to communicate with me . &quot;
And I said , &quot; Wait a second , isn &apos;t that -- I &apos;ve seen Stephen Hawking -- don &apos;t all paralyzed people have the ability to communicate via these devices ? &quot;
And he said , &quot; No , unless you &apos;re in the upper echelon and you &apos;ve got really amazing insurance , you can &apos;t actually do that .
These devices aren &apos;t accessible to people . &quot;
And I said , &quot; Well , how do you actually communicate ? &quot;
Has everyone seen the movie &quot; The Diving Bell and the Butterfly ? &quot;
That &apos;s how they communicate -- so run their finger along .
I said , &quot; That &apos;s archaic . How can that be ? &quot;
So I showed up with the desire to just write a check , and instead , I wrote a check that I had no freaking idea how I was going to cash .
I committed to his brother and his father right then and there -- I &apos;m like , &quot; All right , here &apos;s the deal : Tony &apos;s going to speak , we &apos;re going to get him a machine , and we &apos;re going to figure out a way for him to do his art again .
Because it &apos;s a travesty that someone who still has all of that in him isn &apos;t able to communicate it . &quot;
So I spoke at a conference a couple months after that .
I met these guys called GRL , Graffiti Research Lab , and they have a technology that allows them to project a light onto any surface and then , with a laser pointer , draw on it , and it just registers the negative space .
So they go around and do art installations like this .
All the things that go up there , they said there &apos;s a life cycle .
First it starts with the sexual organs , then it starts with cuss words , then it was Bush slanders and then people actually got to art .
But there was always a life cycle to their presentations .
So I went home and was having dinner with my wife and was telling her about this , and we were like , &quot; Well wait a second . If we know that this technology exists where you can use your eyes to control things , why don &apos;t we figure out a way for TEMPT to control a laser and he could do graf again ? Well that would be awesome . &quot;
So that started the journey .
And about two years later , about a year later , after a bunch of organization and a bunch of moving things around , we &apos;d accomplished a couple things .
One , we battered down the doors of the insurance companies , and we actually got TEMPT a machine that let him communicate -- a Stephen Hawking machine .
Which was awesome .
And he &apos;s seriously one of the funniest -- I call him Yoda , because you talk to the guy , you get an email from him , and you &apos;re like , &quot; I &apos;m not worthy . This guy &apos;s so amazing . &quot;
The other thing we did is we flew seven programmers from all over the world -- literally every corner of the world -- into our house .
My wife and kids and I moved to our back garage , and these hackers and programmers and conspiracy theorists and anarchists took over our house .
A lot of our friends thought we were absolutely stupid to do that and that we were going to come back and all the pictures on the wall would be removed and graf on the walls .
But for over two weeks , we programmed , we went to the Venice boardwalk , my kids got involved , my dog got involved , and we created this .
This is called the EyeWriter , and you can see the description .
This is a cheap pair of sunglasses that we bought at the Venice Beach boardwalk , some copper wire and some stuff from Home Depot and Radio Shack .
We took a PS3 camera , hacked it open , mounted it to an LED light , and now there &apos;s a device that is free -- you build this yourself , we publish the code for free , you download the software for free .
And now we &apos;ve created a device that has absolutely no limitations .
There &apos;s no insurance company that can say &quot; No . &quot;
There &apos;s no hospital that can say &quot; No . &quot;
Anybody who &apos;s paralyzed now has access to actually draw or communicate using only their eyes .
Thank you .
Thank you guys very much . That was awesome .
So at the end of the two weeks , we went back to TEMPT &apos;s room .
I love this picture , because this is someone else &apos;s room and that &apos;s his room .
So there &apos;s all this hustle and bustle going on for the big unveiling .
And after over a year of planning , two weeks of programming , carb-fest and all-night sessions , Tony drew again for the first time in seven years .
And this is an amazing picture , because this is his life support system , and he &apos;s looking over his life support system .
We kicked his bed so that he could see out .
And we set up a projector on a wall out in the parking lot outside of his hospital .
And he drew again for the first time , in front of his family and friends -- and you can only imagine what the feeling in the parking lot was .
The funny thing was , we had to break into the parking lot too , so we totally felt like we were legit in the whole graf scene too .
So at the end of this , he sent us an email , and this is what the email said : &quot; That was the first time I &apos;ve drawn anything for seven years .
I feel like I had been held underwater , and someone finally reached down and pulled my head up so I could breathe . &quot;
Isn &apos;t that awesome ?
So that &apos;s kind of our battle cry .
That &apos;s what keeps us going and keeps us developing .
And we &apos;ve got such a long way to go with this .
This is an amazing device , but it &apos;s the equivalent of an Etch A Sketch .
And someone who has that kind of artistic potential deserves so much more .
So we &apos;re in the process of trying to figure out how to make it better , faster , stronger .
Since that time , we &apos;ve had all kinds of acknowledgment .
We &apos;ve won a bunch of awards .
Remember , it &apos;s free ; none of us are making any money on this thing .
It &apos;s all coming out of our own pockets .
So the awards were like , &quot; Oh , this is fantastic . &quot;
Armstrong Twittered about us , and then in December , Time magazine honored us as one of the top 50 inventions of 2010 , which was really cool .
The coolest thing about this -- and this is what &apos;s completing the whole circle -- is that in April of this year , at the Geffen MOCA in downtown Los Angeles , there &apos;s going to be an exhibition called &quot; Art of the Streets . &quot;
And &quot; Art of the Streets &quot; is going to have pretty much the bad-asses of the street art scene -- Banksy , Shepard Fairey , KAWS -- all of these guys will be there .
TEMPT &apos;s going to be in the show , which is pretty awesome .
So basically this is my point : If you see something that &apos;s not possible , make it possible .
Everything in this room wasn &apos;t possible -- this stage , this computer , this mic , the EyeWriter -- wasn &apos;t possible at one point .
Make it possible , everyone in this room .
I &apos;m not a programmer , never done anything with ocular recognition technology , but I just recognized something and associated myself with amazing people so that we could make something happen .
And this is the question I want everyone to ask yourself every single day when you come up with something you feel that needs to be done : if not now , then when ? And if not me , then who ?
Thank you guys .

Erik Johansson creates realistic photos of impossible scenes -- capturing ideas , not moments . In this witty how-to , the Photoshop wizard describes the principles he uses to make these fantastical scenarios come to life , while keeping them visually plausible .

Erik Johansson : Impossible photography
I &apos;m here to share my photography .
Or is it photography ?
Because , of course , this is a photograph that you can &apos;t take with your camera .
Yet , my interest in photography started as I got my first digital camera at the age of 15 .
It mixed with my earlier passion for drawing , but it was a bit different , because using the camera , the process was in the planning instead .
And when you take a photograph with a camera , the process ends when you press the trigger .
So to me it felt like photography was more about being at the right place and the right time .
I felt like anyone could do that .
So I wanted to create something different , something where the process starts when you press the trigger .
Photos like this : construction going on along a busy road .
But it has an unexpected twist .
And despite that , it retains a level of realism .
Or photos like these -- both dark and colorful , but all with a common goal of retaining the level of realism .
When I say realism , I mean photo-realism .
Because , of course , it &apos;s not something you can capture really , but I always want it to look like it could have been captured somehow as a photograph .
Photos where you will need a brief moment to think to figure out the trick .
So it &apos;s more about capturing an idea than about capturing a moment really .
But what &apos;s the trick that makes it look realistic ?
Is it something about the details or the colors ?
Is it something about the light ?
What creates the illusion ?
Sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
But in the end , it comes down to how we interpret the world and how it can be realized on a two-dimensional surface .
It &apos;s not really what is realistic , it &apos;s what we think looks realistic really .
So I think the basics are quite simple .
I just see it as a puzzle of reality where you can take different pieces of reality and put it together to create alternate reality .
And let me show you a simple example .
Here we have three perfectly imaginable physical objects , something we all can relate to living in a three-dimensional world .
But combined in a certain way , they can create something that still looks three-dimensional , like it could exist .
But at the same time , we know it can &apos;t .
So we trick our brains , because our brain simply doesn &apos;t accept the fact that it doesn &apos;t really make sense .
And I see the same process with combining photographs .
It &apos;s just really about combining different realities .
So the things that make a photograph look realistic , I think it &apos;s the things that we don &apos;t even think about , the things all around us in our daily lives .
But when combining photographs , this is really important to consider , because otherwise it just looks wrong somehow .
So I would like to say that there are three simple rules to follow to achieve a realistic result .
As you can see , these images aren &apos;t really special .
But combined , they can create something like this .
So the first rule is that photos combined should have the same perspective .
Secondly , photos combined should have the same type of light .
And these two images both fulfill these two requirements -- shot at the same height and in the same type of light .
The third one is about making it impossible to distinguish where the different images begin and end by making it seamless .
Make it impossible to say how the image actually was composed .
So by matching color , contrast and brightness in the borders between the different images , adding photographic defects like depth of field , desaturated colors and noise , we erase the borders between the different images and make it look like one single image , despite the fact that one image can contain hundreds of layers basically .
So here &apos;s another example .
One might think that this is just an image of a landscape and the lower part is what &apos;s manipulated .
But this image is actually entirely composed of photographs from different locations .
I personally think that it &apos;s easier to actually create a place than to find a place , because then you don &apos;t need to compromise with the ideas in your head .
But it does require a lot of planning .
And getting this idea during winter , I knew that I had several months to plan it , to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle basically .
So for example , the fish was captured on a fishing trip .
The shores are from a different location .
The underwater part was captured in a stone pit .
And yeah , I even turned the house on top of the island red to make it look more Swedish .
So to achieve a realistic result , I think it comes down to planning .
It always starts with a sketch , an idea .
Then it &apos;s about combining the different photographs .
And here every piece is very well planned .
And if you do a good job capturing the photos , the result can be quite beautiful and also quite realistic .
So all the tools are out there , and the only thing that limits us is our imagination .
Thank you .

In the 1970s , Diana Nyad set long-distance swim records that are still unbroken . Thirty years later , at 60 , she attempted her longest swim yet , from Cuba to Florida . In this funny , powerful talk at TEDMED , she talks about how to prepare mentally to achieve an extreme dream , and asks : What will YOU do with your wild , precious life ?

Diana Nyad : Extreme swimming with the world &apos;s most dangerous jellyfish
Yeah , so a couple of years ago I was turning 60 , and I don &apos;t like being 60 .
And I started grappling with this existential angst of what little I had done with my life .
It wasn &apos;t the resume of breaking this record here , it was more like , who had I become ?
How had I spent my valuable time ?
How could this have gone by like lightning ?
And I couldn &apos;t forgive myself for the countless , countless hours I had lost in negative thought -- all the time I had spent beating myself up for losing my marriage and not stopping the sexual abuse when I was a kid and career moves and this and this and this .
Just why , why didn &apos;t I do it better ? Why ? Why ? Why ?
And then my mother died at 82 .
And so I starting thinking , not only am I not happy with the past , now I &apos;m getting choked with , &quot; I &apos;ve only got 22 years left . &quot;
What am I going to do with this short amount of time that &apos;s just fleeting ?
And I &apos;m not in the present whatsoever .
And I decided the remedy to all this malaise was going to be for me to chase an elevated dream , an extreme dream , something that would require utter conviction and unwavering passion , something that would make me be my best self in every aspect of my life , every minute of every day , because the dream was so big that I couldn &apos;t get there without that kind of behavior and that kind of conviction .
And I decided , it was an old dream that was lingering , that was from so many years ago , three decades ago -- the only sort of world class swim I had tried and failed at back in my 20s -- was going from Cuba to Florida .
It was deep in my imagination .
No one &apos;s ever done it without a shark cage .
It &apos;s daunting .
It &apos;s more than a hundred miles across a difficult passage of ocean .
It &apos;s probably , at my speed , at my age -- for anybody &apos;s speed at anybody &apos;s age -- going to take 60 , maybe 70 , hours of continuous swimming , never getting out on the boat .
And I started to train .
I hadn &apos;t swum for 31 years , not a stroke .
And I had kept in good shape , but swimming &apos;s a whole different animal .
As a matter of fact , this picture is supposed to be me during training .
It &apos;s a smiling face .
And when you &apos;re training for this sport , you are not smiling .
It &apos;s an arduous , difficult sport , and I don &apos;t remember smiling at any time during this sport .
As I said , I respect other sports , and I compare this sport sometimes to cycling and to mountain climbing and other of the expedition type events , but this is a sensory deprivation , a physical duress .
And when I started in with the eight hours and the 10 hours and the 12 hours and the 14 hours and the 15 hours and the 24-hour swims , I knew I had it , because I was making it through these .
And when I said I &apos;m going to go out and do a 15-hour swim , and we &apos;re coming into the dock after a long day and it &apos;s now night , and we come in and it &apos;s 14 hours and 58 minutes and I can touch the dock and we &apos;re done , the trainer says , &quot; That &apos;s great .
It &apos;s 14 hours 58 minutes . Who cares the last two minutes ? &quot;
I say , &quot; No , it &apos;s got to be 15 hours , &quot; and I swim another minute out and another minute back to make the 15 hours .
And I put together an expedition .
It &apos;s not that I didn &apos;t have help , but honestly , I sort of led , I was the team leader .
And to get the government permissions , you read in the paper , you think it &apos;s easy to get into Cuba everyday ?
Try going in with an armada like we had of 50 people and five boats and CNN &apos;s crew , etc .
The navigation is difficult .
There &apos;s a big river called the Gulf Stream that runs across and it &apos;s not going in the direction you are .
It &apos;s going to the east and you &apos;d like to go north .
It &apos;s tricky .
And there &apos;s dehydration .
And there &apos;s hypothermia .
And there are sharks .
And there are all kinds of problems .
And I gathered together , honestly , the world &apos;s leading experts in every possible way .
And a month ago , the 23rd of September , I stood on that shore and I looked across to that long , long faraway horizon and I asked myself , do you have it ?
Are your shoulders ready ?
And they were . They were prepared .
No stone left unturned .
Was the mind ready ?
You know , you &apos;re swimming with the fogged goggles , you &apos;re swimming at 60 strokes a minute , so you &apos;re never really focused on anything , you don &apos;t see well .
You &apos;ve got tight bathing caps over your ears trying to keep the heat of the head , because it &apos;s where the hypothermia starts , and so you don &apos;t hear very well .
You &apos;re really left alone with your own thoughts .
And I had all kinds of counting systems ready there in English , followed by German , followed by Spanish , followed by French .
You save the French for last .
And I had songs , I had a playlist in my head -- not through headphones , in my own head -- of 65 songs .
And I couldn &apos;t wait to get into the dark in the middle of the night , because that &apos;s when Neil Young comes out .
And it &apos;s odd , isn &apos;t it ?
You &apos;d think you &apos;d be singing Leonard Cohen &apos;s &quot; Hallelujah &quot; out in the majesty of the ocean , not songs about heroin addiction in New York City .
But no , for some reason I couldn &apos;t wait to get into the dark of the night and be singing , ♫ &quot; A heard you knocking at my cellar door ♫ ♫ I love you baby and I want some more ♫ ♫ Ooh , ooh , the damage done &quot; ♫ The night before I started , I finished Stephen Hawking &apos;s &quot; The Grand Design . &quot;
And I couldn &apos;t wait to trip the mind fantastic .
About the 50th hour , I was going to start thinking about the edge of the universe .
Is there an edge ?
Is this an envelope we &apos;re living inside of , or no , does it go onto infinity in both time and space ?
And there &apos;s nothing like swimming for 50 hours in the ocean that gets you thinking about things like this .
I couldn &apos;t wait to prove the athlete I am , that nobody else in the world can do this swim .
And I knew I could do it .
And when I jumped into that water , I yelled in my mother &apos;s French , &quot; Courage ! &quot;
And I started swimming , and , oh my God , it was glassy .
And we knew it , all 50 people on the boat , we all knew this was it , this was our time .
And I reminded myself a couple hours in , you know , the sport is sort of a microcosm of life itself .
First of all , you &apos;re going to hit obstacles .
And even though you &apos;re feeling great at any one moment , don &apos;t take it for granted , be ready , because there &apos;s going to be pain , there &apos;s going to be suffering .
It &apos;s not going to feel this good all the way across .
And I was thinking of the hypothermia and maybe some shoulder pain and all the other things -- the vomiting that comes from being in the saltwater .
You &apos;re immersed in the liquid .
Your body doesn &apos;t like the saltwater .
After a couple of days , three days , you tend to rebel in a lot of physical ways .
But no , two hours in , wham ! Never in my life ...
I knew there were Portuguese men o &apos; war , all kinds of moon jellies , all kinds of things , but the box jellyfish from the southern oceans is not supposed to be in these waters .
And I was on fire -- excruciating , excruciating pain .
I don &apos;t know if you can still see the red line here and up the arm .
Evidently , a piece this big of tentacle has a hundred-thousand little barbs on it and each barb is not just stinging your skin , it &apos;s sending a venom .
The most venomous animal that lives in the ocean is the box jellyfish .
And every one of those barbs is sending that venom into this central nervous system .
So first I feel like boiling hot oil , I &apos;ve been dipped in .
And I &apos;m yelling out , &quot; Fire ! Fire ! Fire ! Fire !
Help me ! Somebody help me ! &quot;
And the next thing is paralysis .
I feel it in the back and then I feel it in the chest up here , and I can &apos;t breathe .
And now I &apos;m not swimming with a nice long stroke , I &apos;m sort of crabbing it this way .
Then come convulsions .
A young man on our boat is an EMT . He dives in to try to help me .
He &apos;s stung .
They drag him out on the boat , and he &apos;s -- evidently , I didn &apos;t see any of this -- but lying on the boat and giving himself epinephrine shots and crying out .
He &apos;s 29 years old , very well-built , lean , he &apos;s six-foot , five , weighs 265 lbs . , and he is down .
And he is crying and he &apos;s yelling to my trainer who &apos;s trying to help me .
And he &apos;s saying , &quot; Bonnie , I think I &apos;m going to die .
My breath is down to three breaths a minute .
I need help , and I can &apos;t help Diana . &quot;
So that was at eight o &apos;clock at night .
The doctor , medical team from University of Miami arrived at five in the morning .
So I swam through the night , and at dawn they got there and they started with prednisone shots .
I didn &apos;t get out , but was in the water taking prednisone shots , taking Xanax , oxygen to the face .
It was like an ICU unit in the water .
And I guess the story is that even Navy SEALS who are stung by the box jelly , they &apos;re done .
They either die or they quickly get to a hospital .
And I swam through the night and I swam through the next day .
And the next night at dusk , again , wham !
The box jelly again -- all across the neck , all across here .
And this time , I don &apos;t like it , I didn &apos;t want to give into it , but there &apos;s a difference between a non-stop swim and a staged swim .
And I gave in to the staged swim .
And they got me out and they started again with the epinephrine and the prednisone and with the oxygen and with everything they had on board .
And I got back in .
And I swam through that night and into the next day .
And at 41 hours , this body couldn &apos;t make it .
The devastation of those stings had taken the respiratory system down so that I couldn &apos;t make the progress I wanted .
And the dream was crushed .
And how odd is this intelligent person who put this together and got all these world experts together .
And I knew about the jellyfish , but I was sort of cavalier .
A lot of athletes have this , you know , sort of invincibility .
They should worry about me . I don &apos;t worry about them .
I &apos;ll just swim right through them .
We &apos;ve got benadryl on board . If I get stung , I &apos;ll just grin and bear it .
Well there was no grin and bearing this .
As a matter of fact , the best advice I got was from an elementary school class in the Caribbean .
And I was telling these kids , 120 of them -- they were all in the school on the gymnasium floor -- and I was telling them about the jellyfish and how they &apos;re gelatinous and you can &apos;t see them at night especially .
And they have these long 30 to 40 to 50-ft. tentacles .
And they do this wrapping .
And they can send the poison into the system .
And a little kid from the back was like this .
And I said , &quot; What &apos;s your name ? &quot; &quot; Henry . &quot;
&quot; Henry , what &apos;s your question ? &quot;
He said , &quot; Well , I didn &apos;t have a question so much as I had a suggestion . &quot;
He said , &quot; You know those guys who really believe in what they believe in and so they wear bombs ? &quot;
And I said , &quot; Well it &apos;s odd that you &apos;ve learned of this as a noble kind of pursuit , but yeah , I know those guys . &quot;
He said , &quot; That &apos;s what you need .
You need like a school of fish that would swim in front of you like this . &quot;
&quot; And when the jellyfish come and they wrap their tentacles around the fish , they &apos;re going to be busy with them , and you &apos;ll just scoot around . &quot;
I said , &quot; Oh , it &apos;s like a suicide army . &quot;
He said , &quot; That &apos;s what I &apos;m talking about . That &apos;s what you need . &quot;
And little did I know , that you should listen to eight year-olds .
And so I started that swim in a bathing suit like normal , and , no joke , this is it ; it came from the shark divers .
I finished the swim like this .
I was swimming with this thing on .
That &apos;s how scared of the jellyfish I was .
So now what do I do ?
I wouldn &apos;t mind if every one of you came up on this stage tonight and told us how you &apos;ve gotten over the big disappointments of your lives .
Because we &apos;ve all had them , haven &apos;t we ?
We &apos;ve all had a heartache .
And so my journey now is to find some sort of grace in the face of this defeat .
And I can look at the journey , not just the destination .
I can feel proud . I can stand here in front of you tonight and say I was courageous .
Yeah .
Thank you .
And with all sincerity , I can say , I am glad I lived those two years of my life that way , because my goal to not suffer regrets anymore , I got there with that goal .
When you live that way , when you live with that kind of passion , there &apos;s no time , there &apos;s no time for regrets , you &apos;re just moving forward .
And I want to live every day of the rest of my life that way , swim or no swim .
But the difference in accepting this particular defeat is that sometimes , if cancer has won , if there &apos;s death and we have no choice , then grace and acceptance are necessary .
But that ocean &apos;s still there .
This hope is still alive .
And I don &apos;t want to be the crazy woman who does it for years and years and years , and tries and fails and tries and fails and tries and fails , but I can swim from Cuba to Florida , and I will swim from Cuba to Florida .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
And so , what after that ?
Are you going to swim the Atlantic ?
No , that &apos;s the last swim .
It &apos;s the only swim I &apos;m interested in .
But I &apos;m ready .
And by the way , a reporter called me the other day and he said he looked on Wikipedia and he said he saw my birthday was August 22nd 1949 , and for some odd reason in Wikipedia , they had my death date too .
He said , &quot; Did you know you &apos;re going to die the same place you were born , New York City , and it &apos;s going to be in January of &apos; 35 ? &quot;
I said , &quot; Nope . I didn &apos;t know . &quot;
And now I &apos;m going to live to 85 .
I have three more years than I thought .
And so I ask myself , I &apos;m starting to ask myself now , even before this extreme dream gets achieved for me , I &apos;m asking myself , and maybe I can ask you tonight too , to paraphrase the poet Mary Oliver , she says , &quot; So what is it , what is it you &apos;re doing , with this one wild and precious life of yours ? &quot;
Thank you very much .
Thank you . Thank you .
Thank you . Thank you .
Live it large . Live it large .

Tal Golesworthy is a boiler engineer -- he knows piping and plumbing . When he needed surgery to repair a life-threatening problem with his aorta , he mixed his engineering skills with his doctors &apos; medical knowledge to design a better repair job .

Tal Golesworthy : How I repaired my own heart
I &apos;m a process engineer .
I know all about boilers and incinerators and fabric filters and cyclones and things like that , but I also have Marfan syndrome .
This is an inherited disorder .
And in 1992 I participated in a genetic study and found to my horror , as you can see from the slide , that my ascending aorta was not in the normal range , the green line at the bottom .
Everyone in here will be between 3.2 and 3.6 cm .
I was already up at 4.4 .
And as you can see , my aorta dilated progressively , and I got closer and closer to the point where surgery was going to be necessary .
The surgery on offer was pretty gruesome -- anesthetize you , open your chest , put you on an artificial heart and lung machine , drop your body temperature to about 18 centigrade , stop your heart , cut the aorta out , replace it with a plastic valve and a plastic aorta , and , most importantly , commit you to a lifetime of anticoagulation therapy , normally warfarin .
The thought of the surgery was not attractive .
The thought of the warfarin was really quite frightening .
So I said to myself , I &apos;m an engineer , I &apos;m in R and D , this is just a plumbing problem .
I can do this . I can change this .
So I set out to change the entire treatment for aortic dilation .
The project aim is really quite simple .
The only real problem with the ascending aorta in people with Marfan syndrome is it lacks some tensile strength .
So the possibility exists to simply externally wrap the pipe .
And it would remain stable and operate quite happily .
If your high-pressure hose pipe , or your high-pressure hydraulic line , bulges a little , you just wrap some tape around the outside of it .
It really is that simple in concept , though not in execution .
The great advantage of an external support for me was that I could retain all of my own bits , all of my own endothelium and valves , and not need any anticoagulation therapy .
So where do we start ?
Well this is a sagittal slice through me .
You could see in the middle that device , that little structure , squeezing out .
Now that &apos;s a left ventricle pushing blood up through the aortic valve -- you can see two of the leaflets of the aortic valve working there -- up into the ascending aorta .
And it &apos;s that part , the ascending aorta , which dilates and ultimately bursts , which , of course , is fatal .
We started by organizing image acquisition from magnetic resonance imaging machines and CT imaging machines from which to make a model of the patient &apos;s aorta .
This is a model of my aorta .
I &apos;ve got a real one in my pocket , if anyone would like to look at it and play with it .
You can see , it &apos;s quite a complex structure .
It has a funny trilobal shape at the bottom , which contains the aortic valve .
It then comes back into a round form and then tapers and curves off .
So it &apos;s quite a difficult structure to produce .
This , like I say , is a CAD model of me , and this is one of the later CAD models .
We went through an iterative process of producing better and better models .
When we produced that model we turn it into a solid plastic model , as you can see , using a rapid prototyping technique , another engineering technique .
We then use that former to manufacture a perfectly bespoke porous textile mesh , which takes the shape of the former and perfectly fits the aorta .
So this is absolutely personalized medicine at its best really .
Every patient we do has an absolutely bespoke implant .
Once you &apos;ve made it , the installation &apos;s quite easy .
John Pepper , bless his heart , professor of cardiothoracic surgery -- never done it before in his life -- he put the first one in , didn &apos;t like it , took it out , put the second one in .
Happy , away I went .
Four and a half hours on the table and everything was done .
So the surgical implantation actually was the easiest part .
If you compare our new treatment to the existing alternative , the so-called composite aortic root graft , there are one of two startling comparisons , which I &apos;m sure will be clear to all of you .
Two hours to install one of our devices compared to six hours for the existing treatment .
The existing treatment requires , as I &apos;ve said , the heart and lung bypass machine and it requires a total body cooling .
We don &apos;t need any of that ; we work on a beating heart .
He opens you up , he accesses the aorta while your heart is beating , all at the right temperature .
No breaking into your circulatory system .
So it really is great .
But for me , absolutely the best point is there is no anticoagulation therapy required .
I don &apos;t take any drugs at all other than recreational ones that I would choose to take .
And in fact , if you speak to people who are on long-term warfarin , it is a serious compromise to your quality of life .
And even worse , it inevitably foreshortens your life .
Likewise , if you have the artificial valve option , you &apos;re committed to antibiotic therapy whenever you have any intrusive medical treatment at all .
Even trips to the dentist require that you take antibiotics , in case you get an internal infection on the valve .
Again , I don &apos;t have any of that , so I &apos;m entirely free .
My aorta is fixed , I haven &apos;t got to worry about it , which is a rebirth for me .
Back to the theme of the presentation : In multidisciplinary research , how on earth does a process engineer used to working with boilers end up producing a medical device which transforms his own life ?
Well the answer to that is a multidisciplinary team .
This is a list of the core team .
And as you can see , there are not only two principal technical disciplines there , medicine and engineering , but also there are various specialists from within those two disciplines .
John Pepper there was the cardiac surgeon who did the actual work on me , but everyone else there had to contribute one way or another .
Raad Mohiaddin , medical radiologist : We had to get good quality images from which to make the CAD model .
Warren Thornton , who still does all our CAD models for us , had to write a bespoke piece of CAD code to produce this model from this really rather difficult input data set .
There are some barriers to this though . There are some problems with it .
Jargon is a big one .
I would think no one in this room understands those four first jargon points there .
The engineers amongst you will recognize rapid prototyping and CAD .
The medics amongst you , if there are any , will recognize the first two .
But there will be nobody else in this room that understands all of those four words .
Taking the jargon out was very important to ensure that everyone in the team understood exactly what was meant when a particular phrase was used .
Our disciplinary conventions were funny as well .
We took a lot of horizontal slice images through me , produced those slices and then used those to build a CAD model .
And the very first CAD model we made , the surgeons were playing with the plastic model , couldn &apos;t quite figure it out .
And then we realized that it was actually a mirror image of the real aorta .
And it was a mirror image because in the real world we always look down on plans , plans of houses or streets or maps .
In the medical world they look up at plans .
So the horizontal images were all an inversion .
So one needs to be careful with disciplinary conventions .
Everyone needs to understand what is assumed and what is not assumed .
Institutional barriers were another serious headache in the project .
The Brompton Hospital was taken over by Imperial College &apos;s School of Medicine , and there are some seriously bad relationship problems between the two organizations .
I was working with Imperial and the Brompton , and this generated some serious problems with the project , really problems that shouldn &apos;t exist .
Research and ethics committee : If you want to do anything new in surgery , you have to get a license from your local research and ethics .
I &apos;m sure it &apos;s the same in Poland .
There will be some form of equivalent , which licenses new types of surgery .
We didn &apos;t only have the bureaucratic problems associated with that , was also had professional jealousies .
There were people on the research and ethics committee who really didn &apos;t want to see John Pepper succeed again , because he &apos;s so successful .
And they made extra problems for us .
Bureaucratic problems : Ultimately when you have a new treatment you have to have a guidance note going out for all of the hospitals in the country .
In the U.K. we have the National Institute for Clinical Excellence , NICE .
You &apos;ll have an equivalent in Poland , no doubt .
We had to get past the NICE problem .
We now have a great clinical guidance out on the Net .
So any of the hospitals interested can come along , read the NICE report get in touch with us and then get doing it themselves .
Funding barriers : Another big area to be concerned with .
A big problem with understanding one of those perspectives : When we first approached one of the big U.K. charitable organizations that funds this kind of stuff , what they were looking at was essentially an engineering proposal .
They didn &apos;t understand it ; they were doctors , they were next to God .
It must be rubbish . They binned it .
So in the end I went to private investors and I just gave up on it .
But most R and D is going to be institutionally funded , by the Polish Academy of Sciences or the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council or whatever , and you need to get past those people .
Jargon is a huge problem when you &apos;re trying to work across disciplines , because in an engineering world , we all understand CAD and R.P. -- not in the medical world .
I suppose ultimately the funding bureaucrats have really got to get their act together .
They &apos;ve really got to start talking to each other , and they &apos;ve got to exercise a bit of imagination , if that &apos;s not too much to ask -- which it probably is .
I &apos;ve coined a phrase &quot; obstructive conservatism . &quot;
So many people in the medical world don &apos;t want to change , particularly not when some jumped-up engineer has come along with the answer .
They don &apos;t want to change .
They simply want to do whatever they &apos;ve done before .
And in fact , there are many surgeons in the U.K.
still waiting for one of our patients to have some sort of episode , so that they can say , &quot; Ah , I told you that was no good . &quot;
We &apos;ve actually got 30 patients .
I &apos;m at seven and a half years .
We &apos;ve got 90 post-op patient years between us , and we haven &apos;t had a single problem .
And still , there are people in the U.K. saying , &quot; Yeah , that external aortic root , yeah , it &apos;ll never work , you know . &quot;
It really is a problem . It really is a problem .
I &apos;m sure everyone in this room has come across arrogance amongst medics , doctors , surgeons at some point .
The middle point is simply the way that the doctors protect themselves .
&quot; Yeah , well of course , I &apos;m looking after my patient . &quot;
I think it &apos;s not good , but there you are , that &apos;s my view .
Egos , of course , again , a huge problem If you &apos;re working in a multidisciplinary team , you &apos;ve got to give your guys the benefit of the doubt .
You &apos;ve got to express support for them .
Tom Treasure , professor of cardiothoracic surgery : incredible guy .
Dead easy to give him respect .
Him giving me respect ? Slightly different .
That &apos;s all the bad news .
The good news is the benefits are stonkingly huge .
Translate that one . I bet they can &apos;t .
When you have a group of people who have had a different professional training , a different professional experience , they not only have a different knowledge base , but they have a different perspective on everything .
And if you can bring those guys together and you can get them talking and understanding each other , the results can be spectacular .
You can find novel solutions , really novel solutions , that have never been looked at before very , very quickly and easily .
You can shortcut huge amounts of work simply by using the extended knowledge base you have .
And as a result , it &apos;s an entirely different use of the technology and the knowledge around you .
The result of all this is that you can get incredibly quick progress on incredibly small budgets .
I &apos;m so embarrassed at how cheap it was to get from my idea to me being implanted that I &apos;m not prepared to tell you what it cost .
Because I suspect there are absolutely standard surgical treatments probably in the USA which cost more for a one-off patient than the cost of us getting from my dream to my reality .
That &apos;s all I want to say , and I &apos;ve got three minutes left .
So Heather &apos;s going to like me .
If you have any questions , please come up and talk to me later on .
It would be a pleasure to speak with you . Many thanks .

Empathy , cooperation , fairness and reciprocity -- caring about the well-being of others seems like a very human trait . But Frans de Waal shares some surprising videos of behavioral tests , on primates and other mammals , that show how many of these moral traits all of us share .
animals , community , morality , science

Frans de Waal : Moral behavior in animals
I was born in Den Bosch , where the painter Hieronymus Bosch named himself after .
And so I &apos;ve always been very fond of this painter who lived and worked in the 15th century .
And what is interesting about him in relation to morality is that he lived at a time where religion &apos;s influence was waning , and he was sort of wondering , I think , what would happen with society if there was no religion or if there was less religion .
And so he painted this famous painting , &quot; The Garden of Earthly Delights , &quot; which some have interpreted as being humanity before the Fall , or being humanity without any Fall at all .
And so it makes you wonder , what would happen if we hadn &apos;t tasted the fruit of knowledge , so to speak , and what kind of morality would we have ?
Much later , as a student , I went to a very different garden , a zoological garden in Arnhem where we keep chimpanzees .
This is me at an early age with a baby chimpanzee .
And I discovered there that the chimpanzees are very power hungry and wrote a book about it .
And at that time the focus in a lot of animal research was on aggression and competition .
I painted a whole picture of the animal kingdom , and humanity included , was that deep down we are competitors , we are aggressive , we &apos;re all out for our own profit basically .
This is the launch of my book .
I &apos;m not sure how well the chimpanzees read it , but they surely seemed interested in the book .
Now in the process of doing all this work on power and dominance and aggression and so on , I discovered that chimpanzees reconcile after fights .
And so what you see here is two males who have had a fight .
They ended up in a tree , and one of them holds out a hand to the other .
And about a second after I took the picture , they came together in the fork of the tree and they kissed and embraced each other .
Now this is very interesting because at the time everything was about competition and aggression , and so it wouldn &apos;t make any sense .
The only thing that matters is that you win or that you lose .
But why would you reconcile after a fight ?
That doesn &apos;t make any sense .
This is the way bonobos do it . Bonobos do everything with sex .
And so they also reconcile with sex .
But the principle is exactly the same .
The principle is that you have a valuable relationship that is damaged by conflict , so you need to do something about it .
So my whole picture of the animal kingdom , and including humans also , started to change at that time .
So we have this image in political science , economics , the humanities , philosophy for that matter , that man is a wolf to man .
And so deep down our nature &apos;s actually nasty .
I think it &apos;s a very unfair image for the wolf .
The wolf is , after all , a very cooperative animal .
And that &apos;s why many of you have a dog at home , which has all these characteristics also .
And it &apos;s really unfair to humanity , because humanity is actually much more cooperative and empathic than given credit for .
So I started getting interested in those issues and studying that in other animals .
So these are the pillars of morality .
If you ask anyone , &quot; What is morality based on ? &quot;
these are the two factors that always come out .
One is reciprocity , and associated with it is a sense of justice and a sense of fairness .
And the other one is empathy and compassion .
And human morality is more than this , but if you would remove these two pillars , there would be not much remaining I think .
And so they &apos;re absolutely essential .
So let me give you a few examples here .
This is a very old video from the Yerkes Primate Center where they train chimpanzees to cooperate .
So this is already about a hundred years ago that we were doing experiments on cooperation .
What you have here is two young chimpanzees who have a box , and the box is too heavy for one chimp to pull in .
And of course , there &apos;s food on the box .
Otherwise they wouldn &apos;t be pulling so hard .
And so they &apos;re bringing in the box .
And you can see that they &apos;re synchronized .
You can see that they work together , they pull at the same moment .
It &apos;s already a big advance over many other animals who wouldn &apos;t be able to do that .
And now you &apos;re going to get a more interesting picture , because now one of the two chimps has been fed .
So one of the two is not really interested in the task anymore .
Now look at what happens at the very end of this .
He takes basically everything .
So there are two interesting parts about this .
One is that the chimp on the right has a full understanding he needs the partner -- so a full understanding of the need for cooperation .
The second one is that the partner is willing to work even though he &apos;s not interested in the food .
Why would that be ? Well that probably has to do with reciprocity .
There &apos;s actually a lot of evidence in primates and other animals that they return favors .
So he will get a return favor at some point in the future .
And so that &apos;s how this all operates .
We do the same task with elephants .
Now with elephants , it &apos;s very dangerous to work with elephants .
Another problem with elephants is that you cannot make an apparatus that is too heavy for a single elephant .
Now you can probably make it , but it &apos;s going to be a pretty flimsy apparatus I think .
And so what we did in that case -- we do these studies in Thailand for Josh Plotnik -- is we have an apparatus around which there is a rope , a single rope .
And if you pull on this side of the rope , the rope disappears on the other side .
So two elephants need to pick it up at exactly the same time and pull .
Otherwise nothing is going to happen and the rope disappears .
And the first tape you &apos;re going to see is two elephants who are released together arrive at the apparatus .
The apparatus is on the left with food on it .
And so they come together , they arrive together , they pick it up together and they pull together .
So it &apos;s actually fairly simple for them .
There they are .
And so that &apos;s how they bring it in .
But now we &apos;re going to make it more difficult .
Because the whole purpose of this experiment is to see how well they understand cooperation .
Do they understand that as well as the chimps , for example ?
And so what we do in the next step is we release one elephant before the other , and that elephant needs to be smart enough to stay there and wait and not pull at the rope -- because if he pulls at the rope , it disappears and the whole test is over .
Now this elephant does something illegal that we did not teach it .
But it shows the understanding that he has , because he puts his big foot on the rope , stands on the rope and waits there for the other , and then the other is going to do all the work for him .
So it &apos;s what we call freeloading .
But it shows the intelligence that the elephants have .
They develop several of these alternative techniques that we did not approve of necessarily .
So the other elephant is now coming and is going to pull it in .
Now look at the other . The other doesn &apos;t forget to eat , of course .
This was the cooperation , reciprocity part .
Now something on empathy .
Empathy is my main topic at the moment of research .
And empathy has sort of two qualities .
One is the understanding part of it . This is just a regular definition : the ability to understand and share the feelings of another .
And the emotional part .
And so empathy has basically two channels .
One is the body channel .
If you talk with a sad person , you &apos;re going to adopt a sad expression and a sad posture , and before you know it you feel sad .
And that &apos;s sort of the body channel of emotional empathy , which many animals have .
Your average dog has that also .
That &apos;s actually why people keep mammals in the home and not turtles or snakes or something like that who don &apos;t have that kind of empathy .
And then there &apos;s a cognitive channel , which is more that you can take the perspective of somebody else .
And that &apos;s more limited .
There &apos;s few animals -- I think elephants and apes can do that kind of thing -- but there are very few animals who can do that .
So synchronization , which is part of that whole empathy mechanism is a very old one in the animal kingdom .
And in humans , of course , we can study that with yawn contagion .
Humans yawn when others yawn .
And it &apos;s related to empathy .
It activates the same areas in the brain .
Also , we know that people who have a lot of yawn contagion are highly empathic .
People who have problems with empathy , such as autistic children , they don &apos;t have yawn contagion .
So it is connected .
And we study that in our chimpanzees by presenting them with an animated head .
So that &apos;s what you see on the upper-left , an animated head that yawns .
And there &apos;s a chimpanzee watching , an actual real chimpanzee watching a computer screen on which we play these animations .
So yawn contagion that you &apos;re probably all familiar with -- and maybe you &apos;re going to start yawning soon now -- is something that we share with other animals .
And that &apos;s related to that whole body channel of synchronization that underlies empathy and that is universal in the mammals basically .
Now we also study more complex expressions . This is consolation .
This is a male chimpanzee who has lost a fight and he &apos;s screaming , and a juvenile comes over and puts an arm around him and calms him down .
That &apos;s consolation . It &apos;s very similar to human consolation .
And consolation behavior , it &apos;s empathy driven .
Actually the way to study empathy in human children is to instruct a family member to act distressed , and then they see what young children do .
And so it is related to empathy , and that &apos;s the kind of expressions we look at .
We also recently published an experiment you may have heard about .
It &apos;s on altruism and chimpanzees where the question is , do chimpanzees care about the welfare of somebody else ?
And for decades it had been assumed that only humans can do that , that only humans worry about the welfare of somebody else .
Now we did a very simple experiment .
We do that on chimpanzees that live in Lawrenceville , in the field station of Yerkes .
And so that &apos;s how they live .
And we call them into a room and do experiments with them .
In this case , we put two chimpanzees side-by-side .
and one has a bucket full of tokens , and the tokens have different meanings .
One kind of token feeds only the partner who chooses , the other one feeds both of them .
So this is a study we did with Vicky Horner .
And here you have the two color tokens .
So they have a whole bucket full of them .
And they have to pick one of the two colors .
You will see how that goes .
So if this chimp makes the selfish choice , which is the red token in this case , he needs to give it to us .
So we pick it up , we put it on a table where there &apos;s two food rewards , but in this case only the one on the right gets food .
The one on the left walks away because she knows already .
that this is not a good test for her .
Then the next one is the pro-social token .
So the one who makes the choices -- that &apos;s the interesting part here -- for the one who makes the choices , it doesn &apos;t really matter .
So she gives us now a pro-social token and both chimps get fed .
So the one who makes the choices always gets a reward .
So it doesn &apos;t matter whatsoever .
And she should actually be choosing blindly .
But what we find is that they prefer the pro-social token .
So this is the 50 percent line that &apos;s the random expectation .
And especially if the partner draws attention to itself , they choose more .
And if the partner puts pressure on them -- so if the partner starts spitting water and intimidating them -- then the choices go down .
It &apos;s as if they &apos;re saying , &quot; If you &apos;re not behaving , I &apos;m not going to be pro-social today . &quot;
And this is what happens without a partner , when there &apos;s no partner sitting there .
And so we found that the chimpanzees do care about the well-being of somebody else -- especially , these are other members of their own group .
So the final experiment that I want to mention to you is our fairness study .
And so this became a very famous study .
And there &apos;s now many more , because after we did this about 10 years ago , it became very well known .
And we did that originally with capuchin monkeys .
And I &apos;m going to show you the first experiment that we did .
It has now been done with dogs and with birds and with chimpanzees .
But with Sarah Brosnan we started out with capuchin monkeys .
So what we did is we put two capuchin monkeys side-by-side .
Again , these animals , they live in a group , they know each other .
We take them out of the group , put them in a test chamber .
And there &apos;s a very simple task that they need to do .
And if you give both of them cucumber for the task , the two monkeys side-by-side , they &apos;re perfectly willing to do this 25 times in a row .
So cucumber , even though it &apos;s only really water in my opinion , but cucumber is perfectly fine for them .
Now if you give the partner grapes -- the food preferences of my capuchin monkeys correspond exactly with the prices in the supermarket -- and so if you give them grapes -- it &apos;s a far better food -- then you create inequity between them .
So that &apos;s the experiment we did .
Recently we videotaped it with new monkeys who &apos;d never done the task , thinking that maybe they would have a stronger reaction , and that turned out to be right .
The one on the left is the monkey who gets cucumber .
The one on the right is the one who gets grapes .
The one who gets cucumber , note that the first piece of cucumber is perfectly fine .
The first piece she eats .
Then she sees the other one getting grape , and you will see what happens .
So she gives a rock to us . That &apos;s the task .
And we give her a piece of cucumber and she eats it .
The other one needs to give a rock to us .
And that &apos;s what she does .
And she gets a grape and she eats it .
The other one sees that .
She gives a rock to us now , gets , again , cucumber .
She tests a rock now against the wall .
She needs to give it to us .
And she gets cucumber again .
So this is basically the Wall Street protest that you see here .
Let me tell you -- I still have two minutes left , let me tell you a funny story about this .
This study became very famous and we got a lot of comments , especially anthropologists , economists , philosophers .
They didn &apos;t like this at all .
Because they had decided in their minds , I believe , that fairness is a very complex issue and that animals cannot have it .
And so one philosopher even wrote us that it was impossible that monkeys had a sense of fairness because fairness was invented during the French Revolution .
Now another one wrote a whole chapter saying that he would believe it had something to do with fairness if the one who got grapes would refuse the grapes .
Now the funny thing is that Sarah Brosnan , who &apos;s been doing this with chimpanzees , had a couple of combinations of chimpanzees where , indeed , the one who would get the grape would refuse the grape until the other guy also got a grape .
So we &apos;re getting very close to the human sense of fairness .
And I think philosophers need to rethink their philosophy for awhile .
So let me summarize .
I believe there &apos;s an evolved morality .
I think morality is much more than what I &apos;ve been talking about , but it would be impossible without these ingredients that we find in other primates , which are empathy and consolation , pro-social tendencies and reciprocity and a sense of fairness .
And so we work on these particular issues to see if we can create a morality from the bottom up , so to speak , without necessarily God and religion involved , and to see how we can get to an evolved morality .
And I thank you for your attention .

Mark Bezos : A life lesson from a volunteer firefighter
Back in New York , I am the head of development for a non-profit called Robin Hood .
When I &apos;m not fighting poverty , I &apos;m fighting fires as the assistant captain of a volunteer fire company .
Now in our town , where the volunteers supplement a highly skilled career staff , you have to get to the fire scene pretty early to get in on any action .
I remember my first fire .
I was the second volunteer on the scene , so there was a pretty good chance I was going to get in .
But still it was a real footrace against the other volunteers to get to the captain in charge to find out what our assignments would be .
When I found the captain , he was having a very engaging conversation with the homeowner , who was surely having one of the worst days of her life .
Here it was , the middle of the night , she was standing outside in the pouring rain , under an umbrella , in her pajamas , barefoot , while her house was in flames .
The other volunteer who had arrived just before me -- let &apos;s call him Lex Luther -- got to the captain first and was asked to go inside and save the homeowner &apos;s dog .
The dog ! I was stunned with jealousy .
Here was some lawyer or money manager who , for the rest of his life , gets to tell people that he went into a burning building to save a living creature , just because he beat me by five seconds .
Well , I was next .
The captain waved me over .
He said , &quot; Bezos , I need you to go into the house .
I need you to go upstairs , past the fire , and I need you to get this woman a pair of shoes . &quot;
I swear .
So , not exactly what I was hoping for , but off I went -- up the stairs , down the hall , past the &apos; real &apos; firefighters , who were pretty much done putting out the fire at this point , into the master bedroom to get a pair of shoes .
Now I know what you &apos;re thinking , but I &apos;m no hero .
I carried my payload back downstairs where I met my nemesis and the precious dog by the front door .
We took our treasures outside to the homeowner , where , not surprisingly , his received much more attention than did mine .
A few weeks later , the department received a letter from the homeowner thanking us for the valiant effort displayed in saving her home .
The act of kindness she noted above all others : someone had even gotten her a pair of shoes .
In both my vocation at Robin Hood and my avocation as a volunteer firefighter , I am witness to acts of generosity and kindness on a monumental scale , but I &apos;m also witness to acts of grace and courage on an individual basis .
And you know what I &apos;ve learned ?
They all matter .
So as I look around this room at people who either have achieved , or are on their way to achieving , remarkable levels of success , I would offer this reminder : don &apos;t wait .
Don &apos;t wait until you make your first million to make a difference in somebody &apos;s life .
If you have something to give , give it now .
Serve food at a soup kitchen . Clean up a neighborhood park .
Be a mentor .
Not every day is going to offer us a chance to save somebody &apos;s life , but every day offers us an opportunity to affect one .
So get in the game . Save the shoes .
Thank you .
Bruno Giussani : Mark , Mark , come back .
Mark Bezos : Thank you .

Jok Church : A circle of caring
You know , what I do is write for children , and I &apos;m probably America &apos;s most widely read children &apos;s author , in fact .
And I always tell people that I don &apos;t want to show up looking like a scientist .
You can have me as a farmer , or in leathers , and no one has ever chose farmer .
I &apos;m here today to talk to you about circles and epiphanies .
And you know , an epiphany is usually something you find that you dropped someplace .
You &apos;ve just got to go around the block to see it as an epiphany .
That &apos;s a painting of a circle .
A friend of mine did that -- Richard Bollingbroke .
It &apos;s the kind of complicated circle that I &apos;m going to tell you about .
My circle began back in the &apos; 60s in high school in Stow , Ohio where I was the class queer .
I was the guy beaten up bloody every week in the boys &apos; room , until one teacher saved my life .
She saved my life by letting me go to the bathroom in the teachers &apos; lounge .
She did it in secret .
She did it for three years .
And I had to get out of town .
I had a thumb , I had 85 dollars , and I ended up in San Francisco , California -- met a lover -- and back in the &apos; 80s , found it necessary to begin work on AIDS organizations .
About three or four years ago , I got a phone call in the middle of the night from that teacher , Mrs. Posten , who said , &quot; I need to see you .
I &apos;m disappointed that we never got to know each other as adults .
Could you please come to Ohio , and please bring that man that I know you have found by now .
And I should mention that I have pancreatic cancer , and I &apos;d like you to please be quick about this . &quot;
Well , the next day we were in Cleveland .
We took a look at her , we laughed , we cried , and we knew that she needed to be in a hospice .
We found her one , we got her there , and we took care of her and watched over her family , because it was necessary .
It &apos;s something we knew how to do .
And just as the woman who wanted to know me as an adult got to know me , she turned into a box of ashes and was placed in my hands .
And what had happened was the circle had closed , it had become a circle -- and that epiphany I talked about presented itself .
The epiphany is that death is a part of life .
She saved my life ; I and my partner saved hers .
And you know , that part of life needs everything that the rest of life does .
It needs truth and beauty , and I &apos;m so happy it &apos;s been mentioned so much here today .
It also needs -- it needs dignity , love and pleasure , and it &apos;s our job to hand those things out .
Thank you .

Ric Elias had a front-row seat on Flight 1549 , the plane that crash-landed in the Hudson River in New York in January 2009 . What went through his mind as the doomed plane went down ? At TED , he tells his story publicly for the first time .

Ric Elias : 3 things I learned while my plane crashed
Imagine a big explosion as you climb through 3,000 ft .
Imagine a plane full of smoke .
Imagine an engine going clack , clack , clack , clack , clack , clack , clack .
It sounds scary .
Well I had a unique seat that day . I was sitting in 1D .
I was the only one who could talk to the flight attendants .
So I looked at them right away , and they said , &quot; No problem . We probably hit some birds . &quot;
The pilot had already turned the plane around , and we weren &apos;t that far .
You could see Manhattan .
Two minutes later , three things happened at the same time .
The pilot lines up the plane with the Hudson River .
That &apos;s usually not the route .
He turns off the engines .
Now imagine being in a plane with no sound .
And then he says three words -- the most unemotional three words I &apos;ve ever heard .
He says , &quot; Brace for impact . &quot;
I didn &apos;t have to talk to the flight attendant anymore .
I could see in her eyes , it was terror . Life was over .
Now I want to share with you three things I learned about myself that day .
I learned that it all changes in an instant .
We have this bucket list , we have these things we want to do in life , and I thought about all the people I wanted to reach out to that I didn &apos;t , all the fences I wanted to mend , all the experiences I wanted to have and I never did .
As I thought about that later on , I came up with a saying , which is , &quot; I collect bad wines . &quot;
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there , I &apos;m opening it .
I no longer want to postpone anything in life .
And that urgency , that purpose , has really changed my life .
The second thing I learned that day -- and this is as we clear the George Washington Bridge , which was by not a lot -- I thought about , wow , I really feel one real regret .
I &apos;ve lived a good life .
In my own humanity and mistakes , I &apos;ve tried to get better at everything I tried .
But in my humanity , I also allow my ego to get in .
And I regretted the time I wasted on things that did not matter with people that matter .
And I thought about my relationship with my wife , with my friends , with people .
And after , as I reflected on that , I decided to eliminate negative energy from my life .
It &apos;s not perfect , but it &apos;s a lot better .
I &apos;ve not had a fight with my wife in two years .
It feels great .
I no longer try to be right ; I choose to be happy .
The third thing I learned -- and this is as your mental clock starts going , &quot; 15 , 14 , 13 . &quot;
You can see the water coming .
I &apos;m saying , &quot; Please blow up . &quot;
I don &apos;t want this thing to break in 20 pieces like you &apos;ve seen in those documentaries .
And as we &apos;re coming down , I had a sense of , wow , dying is not scary .
It &apos;s almost like we &apos;ve been preparing for it our whole lives .
But it was very sad .
I didn &apos;t want to go ; I love my life .
And that sadness really framed in one thought , which is , I only wish for one thing .
I only wish I could see my kids grow up .
About a month later , I was at a performance by my daughter -- first-grader , not much artistic talent ...
... yet .
And I &apos;m balling , I &apos;m crying , like a little kid .
And it made all the sense in the world to me .
I realized at that point , by connecting those two dots , that the only thing that matters in my life is being a great dad .
Above all , above all , the only goal I have in life is to be a good dad .
I was given the gift of a miracle , of not dying that day .
I was given another gift , which was to be able to see into the future and come back and live differently .
I challenge you guys that are flying today , imagine the same thing happens on your plane -- and please don &apos;t -- but imagine , and how would you change ?
What would you get done that you &apos;re waiting to get done because you think you &apos;ll be here forever ?
How would you change your relationships and the negative energy in them ?
And more than anything , are you being the best parent you can ?
Thank you .

In a culture where being social and outgoing are prized above all else , it can be difficult , even shameful , to be an introvert . But , as Susan Cain argues in this passionate talk , introverts bring extraordinary talents and abilities to the world , and should be encouraged and celebrated .

Susan Cain : The power of introverts
When I was nine years old I went off to summer camp for the first time .
And my mother packed me a suitcase full of books , which to me seemed like a perfectly natural thing to do .
Because in my family , reading was the primary group activity .
And this might sound antisocial to you , but for us it was really just a different way of being social .
You have the animal warmth of your family sitting right next to you , but you are also free to go roaming around the adventureland inside your own mind .
And I had this idea that camp was going to be just like this , but better .
I had a vision of 10 girls sitting in a cabin cozily reading books in their matching nightgowns .
Camp was more like a keg party without any alcohol .
And on the very first day our counselor gathered us all together and she taught us a cheer that she said we would be doing every day for the rest of the summer to instill camp spirit .
And it went like this : &quot; R-O-W-D-I-E , that &apos;s the way we spell rowdie .
Rowdie , rowdie , let &apos;s get rowdie . &quot;
Yeah .
So I couldn &apos;t figure out for the life of me why we were supposed to be so rowdy , or why we had to spell this word incorrectly .
But I recited a cheer . I recited a cheer along with everybody else .
I did my best .
And I just waited for the time that I could go off and read my books .
But the first time that I took my book out of my suitcase , the coolest girl in the bunk came up to me and she asked me , &quot; Why are you being so mellow ? &quot; -- mellow , of course , being the exact opposite of R-O-W-D-I-E .
And then the second time I tried it , the counselor came up to me with a concerned expression on her face and she repeated the point about camp spirit and said we should all work very hard to be outgoing .
And so I put my books away , back in their suitcase , and I put them under my bed , and there they stayed for the rest of the summer .
And I felt kind of guilty about this .
I felt as if the books needed me somehow , and they were calling out to me and I was forsaking them .
But I did forsake them and I didn &apos;t open that suitcase again until I was back home with my family at the end of the summer .
Now , I tell you this story about summer camp .
I could have told you 50 others just like it -- all the times that I got the message that somehow my quiet and introverted style of being was not necessarily the right way to go , that I should be trying to pass as more of an extrovert .
And I always sensed deep down that this was wrong and that introverts were pretty excellent just as they were .
But for years I denied this intuition , and so I became a Wall Street lawyer , of all things , instead of the writer that I had always longed to be -- partly because I needed to prove to myself that I could be bold and assertive too .
And I was always going off to crowded bars when I really would have preferred to just have a nice dinner with friends .
And I made these self-negating choices so reflexively , that I wasn &apos;t even aware that I was making them .
Now this is what many introverts do , and it &apos;s our loss for sure , but it is also our colleagues &apos; loss and our communities &apos; loss .
And at the risk of sounding grandiose , it is the world &apos;s loss .
Because when it comes to creativity and to leadership , we need introverts doing what they do best .
A third to a half of the population are introverts -- a third to a half .
So that &apos;s one out of every two or three people you know .
So even if you &apos;re an extrovert yourself , I &apos;m talking about your coworkers and your spouses and your children and the person sitting next to you right now -- all of them subject to this bias that is pretty deep and real in our society .
We all internalize it from a very early age without even having a language for what we &apos;re doing .
Now to see the bias clearly you need to understand what introversion is .
It &apos;s different from being shy .
Shyness is about fear of social judgment .
Introversion is more about , how do you respond to stimulation , including social stimulation .
So extroverts really crave large amounts of stimulation , whereas introverts feel at their most alive and their most switched-on and their most capable when they &apos;re in quieter , more low-key environments .
Not all the time -- these things aren &apos;t absolute -- but a lot of the time .
So the key then to maximizing our talents is for us all to put ourselves in the zone of stimulation that is right for us .
But now here &apos;s where the bias comes in .
Our most important institutions , our schools and our workplaces , they are designed mostly for extroverts and for extroverts &apos; need for lots of stimulation .
And also we have this belief system right now that I call the new groupthink , which holds that all creativity and all productivity comes from a very oddly gregarious place .
So if you picture the typical classroom nowadays : When I was going to school , we sat in rows .
We sat in rows of desks like this , and we did most of our work pretty autonomously .
But nowadays , your typical classroom has pods of desks -- four or five or six or seven kids all facing each other .
And kids are working in countless group assignments .
Even in subjects like math and creative writing , which you think would depend on solo flights of thought , kids are now expected to act as committee members .
And for the kids who prefer to go off by themselves or just to work alone , those kids are seen as outliers often or , worse , as problem cases .
And the vast majority of teachers reports believing that the ideal student is an extrovert as opposed to an introvert , even though introverts actually get better grades and are more knowledgeable , according to research .
Okay , same thing is true in our workplaces .
Now , most of us work in open plan offices , without walls , where we are subject to the constant noise and gaze of our coworkers .
And when it comes to leadership , introverts are routinely passed over for leadership positions , even though introverts tend to be very careful , much less likely to take outsize risks -- which is something we might all favor nowadays .
And interesting research by Adam Grant at the Wharton School has found that introverted leaders often deliver better outcomes than extroverts do , because when they are managing proactive employees , they &apos;re much more likely to let those employees run with their ideas , whereas an extrovert can , quite unwittingly , get so excited about things that they &apos;re putting their own stamp on things , and other people &apos;s ideas might not as easily then bubble up to the surface .
Now in fact , some of our transformative leaders in history have been introverts .
I &apos;ll give you some examples .
Eleanor Roosevelt , Rosa Parks , Gandhi -- all these peopled described themselves as quiet and soft-spoken and even shy .
And they all took the spotlight , even though every bone in their bodies was telling them not to .
And this turns out to have a special power all its own , because people could feel that these leaders were at the helm , not because they enjoyed directing others and not out of the pleasure of being looked at ; they were there because they had no choice , because they were driven to do what they thought was right .
Now I think at this point it &apos;s important for me to say that I actually love extroverts .
I always like to say some of my best friends are extroverts , including my beloved husband .
And we all fall at different points , of course , along the introvert / extrovert spectrum .
Even Carl Jung , the psychologist who first popularized these terms , said that there &apos;s no such thing as a pure introvert or a pure extrovert .
He said that such a man would be in a lunatic asylum , if he existed at all .
And some people fall smack in the middle of the introvert / extrovert spectrum , and we call these people ambiverts .
And I often think that they have the best of all worlds .
But many of us do recognize ourselves as one type or the other .
And what I &apos;m saying is that culturally we need a much better balance .
We need more of a yin and yang between these two types .
This is especially important when it comes to creativity and to productivity , because when psychologists look at the lives of the most creative people , what they find are people who are very good at exchanging ideas and advancing ideas , but who also have a serious streak of introversion in them .
And this is because solitude is a crucial ingredient often to creativity .
So Darwin , he took long walks alone in the woods and emphatically turned down dinner party invitations .
Theodor Geisel , better known as Dr. Seuss , he dreamed up many of his amazing creations in a lonely bell tower office that he had in the back of his house in La Jolla , California .
And he was actually afraid to meet the young children who read his books for fear that they were expecting him this kind of jolly Santa Claus-like figure and would be disappointed with his more reserved persona .
Steve Wozniak invented the first Apple computer sitting alone in his cubical in Hewlett-Packard where he was working at the time .
And he says that he never would have become such an expert in the first place had he not been too introverted to leave the house when he was growing up .
Now of course , this does not mean that we should all stop collaborating -- and case in point , is Steve Wozniak famously coming together with Steve Jobs to start Apple Computer -- but it does mean that solitude matters and that for some people it is the air that they breathe .
And in fact , we have known for centuries about the transcendent power of solitude .
It &apos;s only recently that we &apos;ve strangely begun to forget it .
If you look at most of the world &apos;s major religions , you will find seekers -- Moses , Jesus , Buddha , Muhammad -- seekers who are going off by themselves alone to the wilderness where they then have profound epiphanies and revelations that they then bring back to the rest of the community .
So no wilderness , no revelations .
This is no surprise though if you look at the insights of contemporary psychology .
It turns out that we can &apos;t even be in a group of people without instinctively mirroring , mimicking their opinions .
Even about seemingly personal and visceral things like who you &apos;re attracted to , you will start aping the beliefs of the people around you without even realizing that that &apos;s what you &apos;re doing .
And groups famously follow the opinions of the most dominant or charismatic person in the room , even though there &apos;s zero correlation between being the best talker and having the best ideas -- I mean zero .
So ...
You might be following the person with the best ideas , but you might not .
And do you really want to leave it up to chance ?
Much better for everybody to go off by themselves , generate their own ideas freed from the distortions of group dynamics , and then come together as a team to talk them through in a well-managed environment and take it from there .
Now if all this is true , then why are we getting it so wrong ?
Why are we setting up our schools this way and our workplaces ?
And why are we making these introverts feel so guilty about wanting to just go off by themselves some of the time ?
One answer lies deep in our cultural history .
Western societies , and in particular the U.S. , have always favored the man of action over the man of contemplation and &quot; man &quot; of contemplation .
But in America &apos;s early days , we lived in what historians call a culture of character , where we still , at that point , valued people for their inner selves and their moral rectitude .
And if you look at the self-help books from this era , they all had titles with things like &quot; Character , the Grandest Thing in the World . &quot;
And they featured role models like Abraham Lincoln who was praised for being modest and unassuming .
Ralph Waldo Emerson called him &quot; A man who does not offend by superiority . &quot;
But then we hit the 20th century and we entered a new culture that historians call the culture of personality .
What happened is we had evolved an agricultural economy to a world of big business .
And so suddenly people are moving from small towns to the cities .
And instead of working alongside people they &apos;ve known all their lives , now they are having to prove themselves in a crowd of strangers .
So , quite understandably , qualities like magnetism and charisma suddenly come to seem really important .
And sure enough , the self-help books change to meet these new needs and they start to have names like &quot; How to Win Friends and Influence People . &quot;
And they feature as their role models really great salesmen .
So that &apos;s the world we &apos;re living in today .
That &apos;s our cultural inheritance .
Now none of this is to say that social skills are unimportant , and I &apos;m also not calling for the abolishing of teamwork at all .
The same religions who send their sages off to lonely mountain tops also teach us love and trust .
And the problems that we are facing today in fields like science and in economics are so vast and so complex that we are going to need armies of people coming together to solve them working together .
But I am saying that the more freedom that we give introverts to be themselves , the more likely that they are to come up with their own unique solutions to these problems .
So now I &apos;d like to share with you what &apos;s in my suitcase today .
Guess what ?
Books .
I have a suitcase full of books .
Here &apos;s Margaret Atwood , &quot; Cat &apos;s Eye . &quot;
Here &apos;s a novel by Milan Kundera .
And here &apos;s &quot; The Guide for the Perplexed &quot; by Maimonides .
But these are not exactly my books .
I brought these books with me because they were written by my grandfather &apos;s favorite authors .
My grandfather was a rabbi and he was a widower who lived alone in a small apartment in Brooklyn that was my favorite place in the world when I was growing up , partly because it was filled with his very gentle , very courtly presence and partly because it was filled with books .
I mean literally every table , every chair in this apartment had yielded its original function to now serve as a surface for swaying stacks of books .
Just like the rest of my family , my grandfather &apos;s favorite thing to do in the whole world was to read .
But he also loved his congregation , and you could feel this love in the sermons that he gave every week for the 62 years that he was a rabbi .
He would takes the fruits of each week &apos;s reading and he would weave these intricate tapestries of ancient and humanist thought .
And people would come from all over to hear him speak .
But here &apos;s the thing about my grandfather .
Underneath this ceremonial role , he was really modest and really introverted -- so much so that when he delivered these sermons , he had trouble making eye contact with the very same congregation that he had been speaking to for 62 years .
And even away from the podium , when you called him to say hello , he would often end the conversation prematurely for fear that he was taking up too much of your time .
But when he died at the age of 94 , the police had to close down the streets of his neighborhood to accommodate the crowd of people who came out to mourn him .
And so these days I try to learn from my grandfather &apos;s example in my own way .
So I just published a book about introversion , and it took me about seven years to write .
And for me , that seven years was like total bliss , because I was reading , I was writing , I was thinking , I was researching .
It was my version of my grandfather &apos;s hours of the day alone in his library .
But now all of a sudden my job is very different , and my job is to be out here talking about it , talking about introversion .
And that &apos;s a lot harder for me , because as honored as I am to be here with all of you right now , this is not my natural milieu .
So I prepared for moments like these as best I could .
I spent the last year practicing public speaking every chance I could get .
And I call this my &quot; year of speaking dangerously . &quot;
And that actually helped a lot .
But I &apos;ll tell you , what helps even more is my sense , my belief , my hope that when it comes to our attitudes to introversion and to quiet and to solitude , we truly are poised on the brink on dramatic change .
I mean , we are .
And so I am going to leave you now with three calls for action for those who share this vision .
Number one : Stop the madness for constant group work .
Just stop it .
Thank you .
And I want to be clear about what I &apos;m saying , because I deeply believe our offices should be encouraging casual , chatty cafe-style types of interactions -- you know , the kind where people come together and serendipitously have an exchange of ideas .
That is great .
It &apos;s great for introverts and it &apos;s great for extroverts .
But we need much more privacy and much more freedom and much more autonomy at work .
School , same thing .
We need to be teaching kids to work together , for sure , but we also need to be teaching them how to work on their own .
This is especially important for extroverted children too .
They need to work on their own because that is where deep thought comes from in part .
Okay , number two : Go to the wilderness .
Be like Buddha , have your own revelations .
I &apos;m not saying that we all have to now go off and build our own cabins in the woods and never talk to each other again , but I am saying that we could all stand to unplug and get inside our own heads a little more often .
Number three : Take a good look at what &apos;s inside your own suitcase and why you put it there .
So extroverts , maybe your suitcases are also full of books .
Or maybe they &apos;re full of champagne glasses or skydiving equipment .
Whatever it is , I hope you take these things out every chance you get and grace us with your energy and your joy .
But introverts , you being you , you probably have the impulse to guard very carefully what &apos;s inside your own suitcase .
And that &apos;s okay .
But occasionally , just occasionally , I hope you will open up your suitcases for other people to see , because the world needs you and it needs the things you carry .
So I wish you the best of all possible journeys and the courage to speak softly .
Thank you very much .
Thank you . Thank you .

Camille Seaman : Haunting photos of polar ice
As an artist , connection is very important to me .
Through my work I &apos;m trying to articulate that humans are not separate from nature and that everything is interconnected .
I first went to Antarctica almost 10 years ago , where I saw my first icebergs .
I was in awe .
My heart beat fast , my head was dizzy , trying to comprehend what it was that stood in front of me .
The icebergs around me were almost 200 feet out of the water , and I could only help but wonder that this was one snowflake on top of another snowflake , year after year .
Icebergs are born when they calve off of glaciers or break off of ice shelves .
Each iceberg has its own individual personality .
They have a distinct way of interacting with their environment and their experiences .
Some refuse to give up and hold on to the bitter end , while others can &apos;t take it anymore and crumble in a fit of dramatic passion .
It &apos;s easy to think , when you look at an iceberg , that they &apos;re isolated , that they &apos;re separate and alone , much like we as humans sometimes view ourselves .
But the reality is far from it .
As an iceberg melts , I am breathing in its ancient atmosphere .
As the iceberg melts , it is releasing mineral-rich fresh water that nourishes many forms of life .
I approach photographing these icebergs as if I &apos;m making portraits of my ancestors , knowing that in these individual moments they exist in that way and will never exist that way again .
It is not a death when they melt ; it is not an end , but a continuation of their path through the cycle of life .
Some of the ice in the icebergs that I photograph is very young -- a couple thousand years old .
And some of the ice is over 100,000 years old .
The last pictures I &apos;d like to show you are of an iceberg that I photographed in Qeqetarsuaq , Greenland .
It &apos;s a very rare occasion that you get to actually witness an iceberg rolling .
So here it is .
You can see on the left side a small boat .
That &apos;s about a 15-foot boat .
And I &apos;d like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and where it is at the waterline .
You can see here , it begins to roll , and the boat has moved to the other side , and the man is standing there .
This is an average-size Greenlandic iceberg .
It &apos;s about 120 feet above the water , or 40 meters .
And this video is real time .
And just like that , the iceberg shows you a different side of its personality .
Thank you .

Amit Sood : Building a museum of museums on the web
My name is Amit .
And 18 months ago , I had another job at Google , and I pitched this idea of doing something with museums and art to my boss who &apos;s actually here , and she allowed me to do it .
And it took 18 months .
A lot of fun , negotiations and stories , I can tell you , with 17 very interesting museums from nine countries .
But I &apos;m going to focus on the demo .
There are a lot of stories about why we did this .
I think my personal story is explained very simply on the slide , and it &apos;s access .
And I grew up in India .
I had a great education -- I &apos;m not complaining -- but I didn &apos;t have access to a lot of these museums and these artworks .
And so when I started traveling and going to these museums , I started learning a lot .
And while working at Google , I tried to put this desire to make it more accessible with technology together .
So we formed a team , a great team of people , and we started doing this .
I &apos;m going to probably get into the demo and then tell you a couple of the interesting things we &apos;ve had since launch .
So , simple : you come to GoogleArtProject.com.
You look around at all these museums here .
You &apos;ve got the Uffizi , you &apos;ve got the MoMA , the Hermitage , the Rijks , the Van Gogh .
I &apos;m going to actually get to one of my favorites , the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York .
Two ways of going in -- very simple .
Click and , bang , you &apos;re in this museum .
It doesn &apos;t matter where you are -- Bombay , Mexico , it doesn &apos;t really matter .
You move around , you have fun .
You want to navigate around the museum ?
Open the plan up , and , in one click , jump .
You &apos;re in there , you want to go to the end of the corridor .
Keep going . Have fun .
Explore .
Thanks . I haven &apos;t come to the best part .
So now I &apos;m in front of one of my favorite paintings , &quot; The Harvesters &quot; by Pieter Bruegel at the Met .
I see this plus sign .
If the museum has given us the image , you click on it .
Now this is one of the images .
So this is all of the meta-data information .
For those of you who are truly interested in art , you can click this -- but I &apos;m going to click this off right now .
And this is one of these images that we captured in what we call gigapixel technology .
So this image , for example , has close to , I think , around 10 billion pixels .
And I get a lot of people asking me : &quot; What do you get for 10 billion pixels ? &quot;
So I &apos;m going to try and show you what you really get for 10 billion pixels .
You can zoom around very simply .
You see some fun stuff happening here .
I love this guy ; his expression is priceless .
But then you really want to go deep .
And so I started playing around , and I found something going on over here .
And I was like , &quot; Hold on . That sounds interesting . &quot;
Went in , and I started noticing that these kids were actually beating something .
I did a little research , spoke to a couple of my contacts at the Met , and actually found out that this is a game called squall , which involves beating a goose with a stick on Shrove Tuesday .
And apparently it was quite popular .
I don &apos;t know why they did it , but I learned something about it .
Now just to get really deep in , you can really get to the cracks .
Now just to give you some perspective , I &apos;m going to zoom out so you really see what you get .
Here is where we were , and this is the painting .
The best is yet to come -- so in a second .
So now let &apos;s just quickly jump into the MoMA , again in New York .
So another one of my favorites , &quot; The Starry Night . &quot;
Now the example I showed you was all about finding details .
But what if you want to see brush strokes ?
And what if you want to see how Van Gogh actually created this masterpiece ?
You zoom in . You really go in .
I &apos;m going to go to one of my favorite parts in this painting , and I &apos;m really going to get to the cracks .
This is &quot; The Starry Night , &quot; I think , never seen like this before .
I &apos;m going to show you my other favorite feature .
There &apos;s a lot of other stuff here , but I don &apos;t have time .
This is the real cool part . It &apos;s called Collections .
Any one of you , anybody -- doesn &apos;t matter if you &apos;re rich , if you &apos;re poor , if you have a fancy house -- doesn &apos;t matter .
You can go and create your own museum online -- create your own collection across all these images .
Very simply , you go in -- and I &apos;ve created this , called The Power of Zoom -- you can just zoom around .
This is &quot; The Ambassadors , &quot; based in the National Gallery .
You can annotate the stuff , send it to your friends and really get a conversation going about what you &apos;re feeling when you go through these masterpieces .
So I think , in conclusion , for me , the main thing is that all the amazing stuff here does not really come from Google .
It doesn &apos;t , in my opinion , even come from the museums .
I probably shouldn &apos;t say that .
It really comes from these artists .
And that &apos;s been my humbling experience in this .
I mean , I hope in this digital medium that we do justice to their artwork and represent it properly online .
And the biggest question I get asked nowadays is , &quot; Did you do this to replicate the experience of going to a museum ? &quot;
And the answer is no .
It &apos;s to supplement the experience .

Hans Rosling had a question : Do some religions have a higher birth rate than others -- and how does this affect global population growth ? Speaking at the TEDxSummit in Doha , Qatar , he graphs data over time and across religions . With his trademark humor and sharp insight , Hans reaches a surprising conclusion on world fertility rates .

Hans Rosling : Religions and babies
I &apos;m going to talk about religion .
But it &apos;s a broad and very delicate subject , so I have to limit myself .
And therefore I will limit myself to only talk about the links between religion and sexuality .
This is a very serious talk .
So I will talk of what I remember as the most wonderful .
It &apos;s when the young couple whisper , &quot; Tonight we are going to make a baby . &quot;
My talk will be about the impact of religions on the number of babies per woman .
This is indeed important , because everyone understands that there is some sort of limit on how many people we can be on this planet .
And there are some people who say that the world population is growing like this -- three billion in 1960 , seven billion just last year -- and it will continue to grow because there are religions that stop women from having few babies , and it may continue like this .
To what extent are these people right ?
When I was born there was less than one billion children in the world , and today , 2000 , there &apos;s almost two billion .
What has happened since , and what do the experts predict will happen with the number of children during this century ?
This is a quiz . What do you think ?
Do you think it will decrease to one billion ?
Will it remain the same and be two billion by the end of the century ?
Will the number of children increase each year up to 15 years , or will it continue in the same fast rate and be four billion children up there ?
I will tell you by the end of my speech .
But now , what does religion have to do with it ?
When you want to classify religion , it &apos;s more difficult than you think .
You go to Wikipedia and the first map you find is this .
It divides the world into Abrahamic religions and Eastern religion , but that &apos;s not detailed enough .
So we went on and we looked in Wikipedia , we found this map .
But that subdivides Christianity , Islam and Buddhism into many subgroups , which was too detailed .
Therefore at Gapminder we made our own map , and it looks like this .
Each country &apos;s a bubble .
The size is the population -- big China , big India here .
And the color now is the majority religion .
It &apos;s the religion where more than 50 percent of the people say that they belong .
It &apos;s Eastern religion in India and China and neighboring Asian countries .
Islam is the majority religion all the way from the Atlantic Ocean across the Middle East , Southern Europe and through Asia all the way to Indonesia .
That &apos;s where we find Islamic majority .
And Christian majority religions , we see in these countries . They are blue .
And that is most countries in America and Europe , many countries in Africa and a few in Asia .
The white here are countries which cannot be classified , because one religion does not reach 50 percent or there is doubt about the data or there &apos;s some other reason .
So we were careful with that .
So bear with our simplicity now when I take you over to this shot .
This is in 1960 .
And now I show the number of babies per woman here : two , four or six -- many babies , few babies .
And here the income per person in comparable dollars .
The reason for that is that many people say you have to get rich first before you get few babies .
So low income here , high income there .
And indeed in 1960 , you had to be a rich Christian to have few babies .
The exception was Japan .
Japan here was regarded as an exception .
Otherwise it was only Christian countries .
But there was also many Christian countries that had six to seven babies per woman .
But they were in Latin America or they were in Africa .
And countries with Islam as the majority religion , all of them almost had six to seven children per woman , irregardless of the income level .
And all the Eastern religions except Japan had the same level .
Now let &apos;s see what has happened in the world .
I start the world , and here we go .
Now 1962 -- can you see they &apos;re getting a little richer , but the number of babies per woman is falling ?
Look at China . They &apos;re falling fairly fast .
And all of the Muslim majority countries across the income are coming down , as do the Christian majority countries in the middle income range .
And when we enter into this century , you &apos;ll find more than half of mankind down here .
And by 2010 , we are actually 80 percent of humans who live in countries with about two children per woman .
It &apos;s a quite amazing development which has happened .
And these are countries from United States here , with $ 40,000 per capita , France , Russia , Iran , Mexico , Turkey , Algeria , Indonesia , India and all the way to Bangladesh and Vietnam , which has less than five percent of the income per person of the United States and the same amount of babies per woman .
I can tell you that the data on the number of children per woman is surprisingly good in all countries .
We get that from the census data .
It &apos;s not one of these statistics which is very doubtful .
So what we can conclude is you don &apos;t have to get rich to have few children .
It has happened across the world .
And then when we look at religions , we can see that the Eastern religions , indeed there &apos;s not one single country with a majority of that religion that has more than three children .
Whereas with Islam as a majority religion and Christianity , you see countries all the way .
But there &apos;s no major difference .
There &apos;s no major difference between these religions .
There is a difference with income .
The countries which have many babies per woman here , they have quite low income .
Most of them are in sub-Saharan Africa .
But there are also countries here like Guatemala , like Papua New Guinea , like Yemen and Afghanistan .
Many think that Afghanistan here and Congo , which have suffered severe conflicts , that they don &apos;t have fast population growth .
It &apos;s the other way around .
In the world today , it &apos;s the countries that have the highest mortality rates that have the fastest population growth .
Because the death of a child is compensated by one more child .
These countries have six children per woman .
They have a sad death rate of one to two children per woman .
But 30 years from now , Afghanistan will go from 30 million to 60 million .
Congo will go from 60 to 120 .
That &apos;s where we have the fast population growth .
And many think that these countries are stagnant , but they are not .
Let me compare Senegal , a Muslim dominated country , with a Christian dominated country , Ghana .
I take them backwards here to their independence , when they were up here in the beginning of the 1960s .
Just look what they have done .
It &apos;s an amazing improvement , from seven children per woman , they &apos;ve gone all the way down to between four and five .
It &apos;s a tremendous improvement .
So what does it take ?
Well we know quite well what is needed in these countries .
You need to have children to survive .
You need to get out of the deepest poverty so children are not of importance for work in the family .
You need to have access to some family planning .
And you need the fourth factor , which perhaps is the most important factor .
But let me illustrate that fourth factor by looking at Qatar .
Here we have Qatar today , and there we have Bangladesh today .
If I take these countries back to the years of their independence , which is almost the same year -- &apos; 71 , &apos; 72 -- it &apos;s a quite amazing development which had happened .
Look at Bangladesh and Qatar .
With so different incomes , it &apos;s almost the same drop in number of babies per woman .
And what is the reason in Qatar ?
Well I do as I always do .
I went to the statistical authority of Qatar , to their webpage -- It &apos;s a very good webpage . I recommend it -- and I looked up -- oh yeah , you can have lots of fun here -- and provided free of charge , I found Qatar &apos;s social trends .
Very interesting . Lots to read .
I found fertility at birth , and I looked at total fertility rate per woman .
These are the scholars and experts in the government agency in Qatar , and they say the most important factors are : &quot; Increased age at first marriage , increased educational level of Qatari woman and more women integrated in the labor force . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t agree more . Science couldn &apos;t agree more .
This is a country that indeed has gone through a very , very interesting modernization .
So what it is , is these four : Children should survive , children shouldn &apos;t be needed for work , women should get education and join the labor force and family planning should be accessible .
Now look again at this .
The average number of children in the world is like in Colombia -- it &apos;s 2.4 today .
There are countries up here which are very poor .
And that &apos;s where family planning , better child survival is needed .
I strongly recommend Melinda Gates &apos; last TEDTalk .
And here , down , there are many countries which are less than two children per woman .
So when I go back now to give you the answer of the quiz , it &apos;s two .
We have reached peak child .
The number of children is not growing any longer in the world .
We are still debating peak oil , but we have definitely reached peak child .
And the world population will stop growing .
The United Nations Population Division has said it will stop growing at 10 billion .
But why do they grow if the number of children doesn &apos;t grow ?
Well I will show you here .
I will use these card boxes in which your notebooks came .
They are quite useful for educational purposes .
Each card box is one billion people .
And there are two billion children in the world .
There are two billion young people between 15 and 30 .
These are rounded numbers .
Then there is one billion between 30 and 45 , almost one between 45 and 60 .
And then it &apos;s my box .
This is me : 60-plus .
We are here on top .
So what will happen now is what we call &quot; the big fill-up . &quot;
You can see that it &apos;s like three billion missing here .
They are not missing because they &apos;ve died ; they were never born .
Because before 1980 , there were much fewer people born than there were during the last 30 years .
So what will happen now is quite straightforward .
The old , sadly , we will die .
The rest of you , you will grow older and you will get two billion children .
Then the old will die .
The rest will grow older and get two billion children .
And then again the old will die and you will get two billion children .
This is the great fill-up .
It &apos;s inevitable .
And can you see that this increase took place without life getting longer and without adding children ?
Religion has very little to do with the number of babies per woman .
All the religions in the world are fully capable to maintain their values and adapt to this new world .
And we will be just 10 billion in this world , if the poorest people get out of poverty , their children survive , they get access to family planning .
That is needed .
But it &apos;s inevitable that we will be two to three billion more .
So when you discuss and when you plan for the resources and the energy needed for the future , for human beings on this planet , you have to plan for 10 billion .
Thank you very much .

Physicists are used to the idea that subatomic particles behave according to the bizarre rules of quantum mechanics , completely different to human-scale objects . In a breakthrough experiment , Aaron O &apos;Connell has blurred that distinction by creating an object that is visible to the unaided eye , but provably in two places at the same time . In this talk he suggests an intriguing way of thinking about the result .
philosophy , physics , science

Aaron O &apos;Connell : Making sense of a visible quantum object
This is a representation of your brain , and your brain can be broken into two parts .
There &apos;s the left half , which is the logical side , and then the right half , which is the intuitive .
And so if we had a scale to measure the aptitude of each hemisphere , then we can plot our brain .
And for example , this would be somebody who &apos;s completely logical .
This would be someone who &apos;s entirely intuitive .
So where would you put your brain on this scale ?
Some of us may have opted for one of these extremes , but I think for most people in the audience , your brain is something like this -- with a high aptitude in both hemispheres at the same time .
It &apos;s not like they &apos;re mutually exclusive or anything .
You can be logical and intuitive .
And so I consider myself one of these people , along with most of the other experimental quantum physicists , who need a good deal of logic to string together these complex ideas .
But at the same time , we need a good deal of intuition to actually make the experiments work .
How do we develop this intuition ? Well we like to play with stuff .
So we go out and play with it , and then we see how it acts , and then we develop our intuition from there .
And really you do the same thing .
that you may have developed over the years is that one thing is only in one place at a time .
I mean , it can sound weird to think about one thing being in two different places at the same time , but you weren &apos;t born with this notion , you developed it .
And I remember watching a kid playing on a car stop .
He was just a toddler and he wasn &apos;t very good at it , and he kept falling over .
But I bet playing with this car stop taught him a really valuable lesson , and that &apos;s that large things don &apos;t let you get right past them , and that they stay in one place .
And so this is a great conceptual model to have of the world , unless you &apos;re a particle physicist .
It &apos;d be a terrible model for a particle physicist , because they don &apos;t play with car stops , they play with these little weird particles .
And when they play with their particles , they find they do all sorts of really weird things -- like they can fly right through walls , or they can be in two different places at the same time .
And so they wrote down all these observations , and they called it the theory of quantum mechanics .
And so that &apos;s where physics was at a few years ago ; you needed quantum mechanics to describe little , tiny particles .
But you didn &apos;t need it to describe the large , everyday objects around us .
This didn &apos;t really sit well with my intuition , and maybe it &apos;s just because I don &apos;t play with particles very often .
Well , I play with them sometimes , but not very often .
And I &apos;ve never seen them .
I mean , nobody &apos;s ever seen a particle .
But it didn &apos;t sit well with my logical side either .
Because if everything is made up of little particles and all the little particles follow quantum mechanics , then shouldn &apos;t everything just follow quantum mechanics ?
I don &apos;t see any reason why it shouldn &apos;t .
And so I &apos;d feel a lot better about the whole thing if we could somehow show that an everyday object also follows quantum mechanics .
So a few years ago , I set off to do just that .
So I made one .
This is the first object that you can see that has been in a mechanical quantum superposition .
So what we &apos;re looking at here is a tiny computer chip .
And you can sort of see this green dot right in the middle .
And that &apos;s this piece of metal I &apos;m going to be talking about in a minute .
This is a photograph of the object .
And here I &apos;ll zoom in a little bit . We &apos;re looking right there in the center .
And then here &apos;s a really , really big close-up of the little piece of metal .
So what we &apos;re looking at is a little chunk of metal , and it &apos;s shaped like a diving board , and it &apos;s sticking out over a ledge .
And so I made this thing in nearly the same way as you make a computer chip .
I went into a clean room with a fresh silicon wafer , and then I just cranked away at all the big machines for about 100 hours .
For the last stuff , I had to build my own machine -- to make this swimming pool-shaped hole underneath the device .
This device has the ability to be in a quantum superposition , but it needs a little help to do it .
Here , let me give you an analogy .
You know how uncomfortable it is to be in a crowded elevator ?
I mean , when I &apos;m in an elevator all alone , I do all sorts of weird things , but then other people get on board and I stop doing those things because I don &apos;t want to bother them , or , frankly , scare them .
So quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects feel the same way .
The fellow passengers for inanimate objects are not just people , but it &apos;s also the light shining on it and the wind blowing past it and the heat of the room .
And so we knew , if we wanted to see this piece of metal behave quantum mechanically , we &apos;re going to have to kick out all the other passengers .
And so that &apos;s what we did .
We turned off the lights , and then we put it in a vacuum and sucked out all the air , and then we cooled it down to just a fraction of a degree above absolute zero .
Now , all alone in the elevator , the little chunk of metal is free to act however it wanted .
And so we measured its motion .
We found it was moving in really weird ways .
Instead of just sitting perfectly still , it was vibrating , and the way it was vibrating was breathing something like this -- like expanding and contracting bellows .
And by giving it a gentle nudge , we were able to make it both vibrate and not vibrate at the same time -- something that &apos;s only allowed with quantum mechanics .
So what I &apos;m telling you here is something truly fantastic .
What does it mean for one thing to be both vibrating and not vibrating at the same time ?
So let &apos;s think about the atoms .
So in one case : all the trillions of atoms that make up that chunk of metal are sitting still and at the same time those same atoms are moving up and down .
Now it &apos;s only at precise times when they align .
The rest of the time they &apos;re delocalized .
That means that every atom is in two different places at the same time , which in turn means the entire chunk of metal is in two different places .
I think this is really cool .
Really .
It was worth locking myself in a clean room to do this for all those years because , check this out , the difference in scale between a single atom and that chunk of metal is about the same as the difference between that chunk of metal and you .
So if a single atom can be in two different places at the same time , that chunk of metal can be in two different places , then why not you ?
I mean , this is just my logical side talking .
So imagine if you &apos;re in multiple places at the same time , what would that be like ?
How would your consciousness handle your body being delocalized in space ?
There &apos;s one more part to the story .
It &apos;s when we warmed it up , and we turned on the lights and looked inside the box , we saw that the piece metal was still there in one piece .
And so I had to develop this new intuition , that it seems like all the objects in the elevator are really just quantum objects just crammed into a tiny space .
You hear a lot of talk about how quantum mechanics says that everything is all interconnected .
Well , that &apos;s not quite right .
It &apos;s more than that ; it &apos;s deeper .
It &apos;s that those connections , your connections to all the things around you , literally define who you are , and that &apos;s the profound weirdness of quantum mechanics .
Thank you .

Imagine a country where girls must sneak out to go to school , with deadly consequences if they get caught learning . This was Afghanistan under the Taliban , and traces of that danger remain today . 22-year-old Shabana Basij-Rasikh runs a school for girls in Afghanistan . She celebrates the power of a family &apos;s decision to believe in their daughters -- and tells the story of one brave father who stood up to local threats . &lt; i &gt; &lt; / i &gt;

Shabana Basij-Rasikh : Dare to educate Afghan girls
When I was 11 , I remember waking up one morning to the sound of joy in my house .
My father was listening to BBC News on his small , gray radio .
There was a big smile on his face which was unusual then , because the news mostly depressed him .
&quot; The Taliban are gone ! &quot; my father shouted .
I didn &apos;t know what it meant , but I could see that my father was very , very happy .
&quot; You can go to a real school now , &quot; he said .
A morning that I will never forget .
A real school .
You see , I was six when the Taliban took over Afghanistan and made it illegal for girls to go to school .
So for the next five years , I dressed as a boy to escort my older sister , who was no longer allowed to be outside alone , to a secret school .
It was the only way we both could be educated .
Each day , we took a different route so that no one would suspect where we were going .
We would cover our books in grocery bags so it would seem we were just out shopping .
The school was in a house , more than 100 of us packed in one small living room .
It was cozy in winter but extremely hot in summer .
We all knew we were risking our lives -- the teacher , the students and our parents .
From time to time , the school would suddenly be canceled for a week because Taliban were suspicious .
We always wondered what they knew about us .
Were we being followed ?
Do they know where we live ?
We were scared , but still , school was where we wanted to be .
I was very lucky to grow up in a family where education was prized and daughters were treasured .
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time .
A total maverick from a remote province of Afghanistan , he insisted that his daughter , my mom , go to school , and for that he was disowned by his father .
But my educated mother became a teacher .
There she is .
She retired two years ago , only to turn our house into a school for girls and women in our neighborhood .
And my father -- that &apos;s him -- he was the first ever in his family to receive an education .
There was no question that his children would receive an education , including his daughters , despite the Taliban , despite the risks .
To him , there was greater risk in not educating his children .
During Taliban years , I remember there were times I would get so frustrated by our life and always being scared and not seeing a future .
I would want to quit , but my father , he would say , &quot; Listen , my daughter , you can lose everything you own in your life .
Your money can be stolen . You can be forced to leave your home during a war .
But the one thing that will always remain with you is what is here , and if we have to sell our blood to pay your school fees , we will .
So do you still not want to continue ? &quot;
Today I am 22 .
I was raised in a country that has been destroyed by decades of war .
Fewer than six percent of women my age have made it beyond high school , and had my family not been so committed to my education , I would be one of them .
Instead , I stand here a proud graduate of Middlebury College .
When I returned to Afghanistan , my grandfather , the one exiled from his home for daring to educate his daughters , was among the first to congratulate me .
He not only brags about my college degree , but also that I was the first woman , and that I am the first woman to drive him through the streets of Kabul .
My family believes in me .
I dream big , but my family dreams even bigger for me .
That &apos;s why I am a global ambassador for 10x10 , a global campaign to educate women .
That &apos;s why I cofounded SOLA , the first and perhaps only boarding school for girls in Afghanistan , a country where it &apos;s still risky for girls to go to school .
The exciting thing is that I see students at my school with ambition grabbing at opportunity .
And I see their parents and their fathers who , like my own , advocate for them , despite and even in the face of daunting opposition .
Like Ahmed . That &apos;s not his real name , and I cannot show you his face , but Ahmed is the father of one of my students .
Less than a month ago , he and his daughter were on their way from SOLA to their village , and they literally missed being killed by a roadside bomb by minutes .
As he arrived home , the phone rang , a voice warning him that if he sent his daughter back to school , they would try again .
&quot; Kill me now , if you wish , &quot; he said , &quot; but I will not ruin my daughter &apos;s future because of your old and backward ideas . &quot;
What I &apos;ve come to realize about Afghanistan , and this is something that is often dismissed in the West , that behind most of us who succeed is a father who recognizes the value in his daughter and who sees that her success is his success .
It &apos;s not to say that our mothers aren &apos;t key in our success .
In fact , they &apos;re often the initial and convincing negotiators of a bright future for their daughters , but in the context of a society like in Afghanistan , we must have the support of men .
Under the Taliban , girls who went to school numbered in the hundreds -- remember , it was illegal .
But today , more than three million girls are in school in Afghanistan .
Afghanistan looks so different from here in America .
I find that Americans see the fragility in changes .
I fear that these changes will not last much beyond the U.S. troops &apos; withdrawal .
But when I am back in Afghanistan , when I see the students in my school and their parents who advocate for them , who encourage them , I see a promising future and lasting change .
To me , Afghanistan is a country of hope and boundless possibilities , and every single day the girls of SOLA remind me of that .
Like me , they are dreaming big .
Thank you .

When most well-intentioned aid workers hear of a problem they think they can fix , they go to work . This , Ernesto Sirolli suggests , is naïve . In this funny and impassioned talk , he proposes that the first step is to listen to the people you &apos;re trying to help , and tap into their own entrepreneurial spirit . His advice on what works will help any entrepreneur .
business , development , global issues

Ernesto Sirolli : Want to help someone ? Shut up and listen !
Everything I do , and everything I do professionally -- my life -- has been shaped by seven years of work as a young man in Africa .
From 1971 to 1977 -- I look young , but I &apos;m not — -- I worked in Zambia , Kenya , Ivory Coast , Algeria , Somalia , in projects of technical cooperation with African countries .
I worked for an Italian NGO , and every single project that we set up in Africa failed .
And I was distraught .
I thought , age 21 , that we Italians were good people and we were doing good work in Africa .
Instead , everything we touched we killed .
Our first project , the one that has inspired my first book , &quot; Ripples from the Zambezi , &quot; was a project where we Italians decided to teach Zambian people how to grow food .
So we arrived there with Italian seeds in southern Zambia in this absolutely magnificent valley going down to the Zambezi River , and we taught the local people how to grow Italian tomatoes and zucchini and ...
And of course the local people had absolutely no interest in doing that , so we paid them to come and work , and sometimes they would show up .
And we were amazed that the local people , in such a fertile valley , would not have any agriculture .
But instead of asking them how come they were not growing anything , we simply said , &quot; Thank God we &apos;re here . &quot;
&quot; Just in the nick of time to save the Zambian people from starvation . &quot;
And of course , everything in Africa grew beautifully .
We had these magnificent tomatoes . In Italy , a tomato would grow to this size . In Zambia , to this size .
And we could not believe , and we were telling the Zambians , &quot; Look how easy agriculture is . &quot;
When the tomatoes were nice and ripe and red , overnight , some 200 hippos came out from the river and they ate everything .
And we said to the Zambians , &quot; My God , the hippos ! &quot;
And the Zambians said , &quot; Yes , that &apos;s why we have no agriculture here . &quot;
&quot; Why didn &apos;t you tell us ? &quot; &quot; You never asked . &quot;
I thought it was only us Italians blundering around Africa , but then I saw what the Americans were doing , what the English were doing , what the French were doing , and after seeing what they were doing , I became quite proud of our project in Zambia .
Because , you see , at least we fed the hippos .
You should see the rubbish — -- You should see the rubbish that we have bestowed on unsuspecting African people .
You want to read the book , read &quot; Dead Aid , &quot; by Dambisa Moyo , Zambian woman economist .
The book was published in 2009 .
We Western donor countries have given the African continent two trillion American dollars in the last 50 years .
I &apos;m not going to tell you the damage that that money has done .
Just go and read her book .
Read it from an African woman , the damage that we have done .
We Western people are imperialist , colonialist missionaries , and there are only two ways we deal with people : We either patronize them , or we are paternalistic .
The two words come from the Latin root &quot; pater , &quot; which means &quot; father . &quot;
But they mean two different things .
Paternalistic , I treat anybody from a different culture as if they were my children . &quot; I love you so much . &quot;
Patronizing , I treat everybody from another culture as if they were my servants .
That &apos;s why the white people in Africa are called &quot; bwana , &quot; boss .
I was given a slap in the face reading a book , &quot; Small is Beautiful , &quot; written by Schumacher , who said , above all in economic development , if people do not wish to be helped , leave them alone .
This should be the first principle of aid .
The first principle of aid is respect .
This morning , the gentleman who opened this conference lay a stick on the floor , and said , &quot; Can we -- can you imagine a city that is not neocolonial ? &quot;
I decided when I was 27 years old to only respond to people , and I invented a system called Enterprise Facilitation , where you never initiate anything , you never motivate anybody , but you become a servant of the local passion , the servant of local people who have a dream to become a better person .
So what you do -- you shut up .
You never arrive in a community with any ideas , and you sit with the local people .
We don &apos;t work from offices .
We meet at the cafe . We meet at the pub .
We have zero infrastructure .
And what we do , we become friends , and we find out what that person wants to do .
The most important thing is passion .
You can give somebody an idea .
If that person doesn &apos;t want to do it , what are you going to do ?
The passion that the person has for her own growth is the most important thing .
The passion that that man has for his own personal growth is the most important thing .
And then we help them to go and find the knowledge , because nobody in the world can succeed alone .
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge , but the knowledge is available .
So years and years ago , I had this idea : Why don &apos;t we , for once , instead of arriving in the community to tell people what to do , why don &apos;t , for once , listen to them ? But not in community meetings .
Let me tell you a secret .
There is a problem with community meetings .
Entrepreneurs never come , and they never tell you , in a public meeting , what they want to do with their own money , what opportunity they have identified .
So planning has this blind spot .
The smartest people in your community you don &apos;t even know , because they don &apos;t come to your public meetings .
What we do , we work one-on-one , and to work one-on-one , you have to create a social infrastructure that doesn &apos;t exist .
You have to create a new profession .
The profession is the family doctor of enterprise , the family doctor of business , who sits with you in your house , at your kitchen table , at the cafe , and helps you find the resources to transform your passion into a way to make a living .
I started this as a tryout in Esperance , in Western Australia .
I was a doing a Ph.D. at the time , trying to go away from this patronizing bullshit that we arrive and tell you what to do .
And so what I did in Esperance that first year was to just walk the streets , and in three days I had my first client , and I helped this first guy who was smoking fish from a garage , was a Maori guy , and I helped him to sell to the restaurant in Perth , to get organized , and then the fishermen came to me to say , &quot; You the guy who helped Maori ? Can you help us ? &quot;
And I helped these five fishermen to work together and get this beautiful tuna not to the cannery in Albany for 60 cents a kilo , but we found a way to take the fish for sushi to Japan for 15 dollars a kilo , and the farmers came to talk to me , said , &quot; Hey , you helped them . Can you help us ? &quot;
In a year , I had 27 projects going on , and the government came to see me to say , &quot; How can you do that ?
How can you do — ? &quot; And I said , &quot; I do something very , very , very difficult .
I shut up , and listen to them . &quot;
So — — So the government says , &quot; Do it again . &quot;
We &apos;ve done it in 300 communities around the world .
We have helped to start 40,000 businesses .
There is a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of solitude .
Peter Drucker , one of the greatest management consultants in history , died age 96 , a few years ago .
Peter Drucker was a professor of philosophy before becoming involved in business , and this is what Peter Drucker says : &quot; Planning is actually incompatible with an entrepreneurial society and economy . &quot;
Planning is the kiss of death of entrepreneurship .
So now you &apos;re rebuilding Christchurch without knowing what the smartest people in Christchurch want to do with their own money and their own energy .
You have to learn how to get these people to come and talk to you .
You have to offer them confidentiality , privacy , you have to be fantastic at helping them , and then they will come , and they will come in droves .
In a community of 10,000 people , we get 200 clients .
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people , the intelligence and the passion ?
Which presentation have you applauded the most this morning ?
Local , passionate people . That &apos;s who you have applauded .
So what I &apos;m saying is that entrepreneurship is where it &apos;s at .
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution -- nonrenewable fossil fuels , manufacturing -- and all of a sudden , we have systems which are not sustainable .
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable .
Freon way of maintaining things is not sustainable .
What we have to look at is at how we feed , cure , educate , transport , communicate for seven billion people in a sustainable way .
The technologies do not exist to do that .
Who is going to invent the technology for the green revolution ? Universities ? Forget about it !
Government ? Forget about it !
It will be entrepreneurs , and they &apos;re doing it now .
There &apos;s a lovely story that I read in a futurist magazine many , many years ago .
There was a group of experts who were invited to discuss the future of the city of New York in 1860 .
And in 1860 , this group of people came together , and they all speculated about what would happen to the city of New York in 100 years , and the conclusion was unanimous : The city of New York would not exist in 100 years .
Why ? Because they looked at the curve and said , if the population keeps growing at this rate , to move the population of New York around , they would have needed six million horses , and the manure created by six million horses would be impossible to deal with .
They were already drowning in manure .
So 1860 , they are seeing this dirty technology that is going to choke the life out of New York .
So what happens ? In 40 years &apos; time , in the year 1900 , in the United States of America , there were 1,001 car manufacturing companies -- 1,001 .
The idea of finding a different technology had absolutely taken over , and there were tiny , tiny little factories in backwaters .
Dearborn , Michigan . Henry Ford .
However , there is a secret to work with entrepreneurs .
First , you have to offer them confidentiality .
Otherwise they don &apos;t come and talk to you .
Then you have to offer them absolute , dedicated , passionate service to them .
And then you have to tell them the truth about entrepreneurship .
The smallest company , the biggest company , has to be capable of doing three things beautifully : The product that you want to sell has to be fantastic , you have to have fantastic marketing , and you have to have tremendous financial management .
Guess what ?
We have never met a single human being in the world who can make it , sell it and look after the money .
It doesn &apos;t exist .
This person has never been born .
We &apos;ve done the research , and we have looked at the 100 iconic companies of the world -- Carnegie , Westinghouse , Edison , Ford , all the new companies , Google , Yahoo .
There &apos;s only one thing that all the successful companies in the world have in common , only one : None were started by one person .
Now we teach entrepreneurship to 16-year-olds in Northumberland , and we start the class by giving them the first two pages of Richard Branson &apos;s autobiography , and the task of the 16-year-olds is to underline , in the first two pages of Richard Branson &apos;s autobiography how many times Richard uses the word &quot; I &quot; and how many times he uses the word &quot; we . &quot;
Never the word &quot; I , &quot; and the word &quot; we &quot; 32 times .
He wasn &apos;t alone when he started .
Nobody started a company alone . No one .
So we can create the community where we have facilitators who come from a small business background sitting in cafes , in bars , and your dedicated buddies who will do to you , what somebody did for this gentleman who talks about this epic , somebody who will say to you , &quot; What do you need ?
What can you do ? Can you make it ?
Okay , can you sell it ? Can you look after the money ? &quot;
&quot; Oh , no , I cannot do this . &quot; &quot; Would you like me to find you somebody ? &quot;
We activate communities .
We have groups of volunteers supporting the Enterprise Facilitator to help you to find resources and people and we have discovered that the miracle of the intelligence of local people is such that you can change the culture and the economy of this community just by capturing the passion , the energy and imagination of your own people .
Thank you .

How can you help kids get a good start ? In this heartfelt and personal talk , Colin Powell , the former U.S. Secretary of State , asks parents , friends and relatives to support children from before they even get to primary school , through community and a strong sense of responsibility . &lt; em &gt; &lt; / em &gt;

Colin Powell : Kids need structure
What I want to do this afternoon is something a little different than what &apos;s scheduled .
Foreign policy , you can figure that out by watching , I don &apos;t know , Rachel Maddow or somebody , but — — I want to talk about young people and structure , young people and structure .
This was last Wednesday afternoon at a school in Brooklyn , New York , at Cristo Rey High School , run by the Jesuits .
And I was talking to this group of students , and take a look at them .
They were around me in three directions .
You &apos;ll noticed that almost all of them are minority .
You &apos;ll notice that the building is rather austere .
It &apos;s an old New York school building , nothing fancy .
They still have old blackboards and whatnot .
And there are about 300 kids in this school , and the school &apos;s been going now for four years , and they &apos;re about to graduate their first class .
Twenty-two people are graduating , and all 22 are going to college .
They all come from homes where there is , for the most part , just one person in the home , usually the mother or the grandmother , and that &apos;s it , and they come here for their education and for their structure .
Now I had this picture taken , and it was put up on my Facebook page last week , and somebody wrote in , &quot; Huh , why does he have him standing at attention like that ? &quot;
And then they said , &quot; But he looks good . &quot;
He does look good , because kids need structure , and the trick I play in all of my school appearances is that when I get through with my little homily to the kids , I then invite them to ask questions , and when they raise their hands , I say , &quot; Come up , &quot; and I make them come up and stand in front of me .
I make them stand at attention like a soldier .
Put your arms straight down at your side , look up , open your eyes , stare straight ahead , and speak out your question loudly so everybody can hear .
No slouching , no pants hanging down , none of that stuff .
And this young man , his name is -- his last name Cruz -- he loved it . That &apos;s all over his Facebook page and it &apos;s gone viral .
So people think I &apos;m being unkind to this kid .
No , we &apos;re having a little fun .
And the thing about it , I &apos;ve done this for years , the younger they are , the more fun it is .
When I get six- and seven-year-olds in a group , I have to figure out how to keep them quiet .
You know that they &apos;ll always start yakking .
And so I play a little game with them before I make them stand at attention .
I say , &quot; Now listen . In the army , when we want you to pay attention , we have a command . It &apos;s called &apos; at ease . &apos; It means everybody be quiet and pay attention . Listen up .
Do you understand ? &quot;
&quot; Uh-huh , uh-huh , uh-huh . &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s practice . Everybody start chatting . &quot;
And I let them go for about 10 seconds , then I go , &quot; At ease ! &quot;
&quot; Huh ! &quot;
&quot; Yes , General . Yes , General . &quot;
Try it with your kids . See if it works .
I don &apos;t think so .
But anyway , it &apos;s a game I play , and it comes obviously from my military experience .
Because for the majority of my adult life , I worked with young kids , teenagers with guns , I call them .
And we would bring them into the army , and the first thing we would do is to put them in an environment of structure , put them in ranks , make them all wear the same clothes , cut all their hair off so they look alike , make sure that they are standing in ranks .
We teach them how to go right face , left face , so they can obey instructions and know the consequences of not obeying instructions .
It gives them structure .
And then we introduce them to somebody who they come to hate immediately , the drill sergeant .
And they hate him .
And the drill sergeant starts screaming at them , and telling them to do all kinds of awful things .
But then the most amazing thing happens over time .
Once that structure is developed , once they understand the reason for something , once they understand , &quot; Mama ain &apos;t here , son .
I &apos;m your worst nightmare . I &apos;m your daddy and your mommy .
And that &apos;s just the way it is . You got that , son ?
Yeah , and then when I ask you a question , there are only three possible answers : yes , sir ; no , sir ; and no excuse , sir .
Don &apos;t start telling me why you didn &apos;t do something .
It &apos;s yes , sir ; no , sir ; no excuse , sir . &quot;
&quot; You didn &apos;t shave . &quot; &quot; But sir — &quot; &quot; No , don &apos;t tell me how often you scraped your face this morning .
I &apos;m telling you you didn &apos;t shave . &quot;
&quot; No excuse , sir . &quot; &quot; Attaboy , you &apos;re learning fast . &quot;
But you &apos;d be amazed at what you can do with them once you put them in that structure .
In 18 weeks , they have a skill . They are mature .
And you know what , they come to admire the drill sergeant and they never forget the drill sergeant .
They come to respect him .
And so we need more of this kind of structure and respect in the lives of our children .
I spend a lot of time with youth groups , and I say to people , &quot; When does the education process begin ? &quot;
We &apos;re always talking about , &quot; Let &apos;s fix the schools .
Let &apos;s do more for our teachers . Let &apos;s put more computers in our schools .
Let &apos;s get it all online . &quot;
That isn &apos;t the whole answer . It &apos;s part of the answer .
But the real answer begins with bringing a child to the school with structure in that child &apos;s heart and soul to begin with .
When does the learning process begin ? Does it begin in first grade ?
No , no , it begins the first time a child in a mother &apos;s arms looks up at the mother and says , &quot; Oh , this must be my mother .
She &apos;s the one who feeds me .
Oh yeah , when I don &apos;t feel so good down there , she takes care of me .
It &apos;s her language I will learn . &quot;
And at that moment they shut out all the other languages that they could be learning at that age , but by three months , that &apos;s her .
And if the person doing it , whether it &apos;s the mother or grandmother , whoever &apos;s doing it , that is when the education process begins .
That &apos;s when language begins .
That &apos;s when love begins . That &apos;s when structure begins .
That &apos;s when you start to imprint on the child that &quot; you are special , you are different from every other child in the world .
And we &apos;re going to read to you . &quot;
A child who has not been read to is in danger when that child gets to school .
A child who doesn &apos;t know his or her colors or doesn &apos;t know how to tell time , doesn &apos;t know how to tie shoes , doesn &apos;t know how to do those things , and doesn &apos;t know how to do something that goes by a word that was drilled into me as a kid : mind .
Mind your manners ! Mind your adults ! Mind what you &apos;re saying !
This is the way children are raised properly .
And I watched my own young grandchildren now come along and they &apos;re , much to the distress of my children , they are acting just like we did . You know ? You imprint them .
And that &apos;s what you have to do to prepare children for education and for school .
And I &apos;m working at all the energy I have to sort of communicate this message that we need preschool , we need Head Start , we need prenatal care .
The education process begins even before the child is born , and if you don &apos;t do that , you &apos;re going to have difficulty .
And we are having difficulties in so many of our communities and so many of our schools where kids are coming to first grade and their eyes are blazing , they &apos;ve got their little knapsack on and they &apos;re ready to go , and then they realize they &apos;re not like the other first graders who know books , have been read to , can do their alphabet .
And by the third grade , the kids who didn &apos;t have that structure and minding in the beginning start to realize they &apos;re behind , and what do they do ?
They act it out . They act it out , and they &apos;re on their way to jail or they &apos;re on their way to being dropouts .
It &apos;s predictable .
If you &apos;re not at the right reading level at third grade , you are a candidate for jail at age 18 , and we have the highest incarceration rate because we &apos;re not getting our kids the proper start in life .
The last chapter in my book is called &quot; The Gift of a Good Start . &quot;
The gift of a good start . Every child ought to have a good start in life .
I was privileged to have that kind of good start .
I was not a great student .
I was a public school kid in New York City , and I didn &apos;t do well at all .
I have my entire New York City Board of Education transcript from kindergarten through college .
I wanted it when I was writing my first book .
I wanted to see if my memory was correct , and , my God , it was .
Straight C everywhere .
And I finally bounced through high school , got into the City College of New York with a 78.3 average , which I shouldn &apos;t have been allowed in with , and then I started out in engineering , and that only lasted six months .
And then I went into geology , &quot; rocks for jocks . &quot; This is easy .
And then I found ROTC .
I found something that I did well and something that I loved doing , and I found a group of youngsters like me who felt the same way .
And so my whole life then was dedicated to ROTC and the military .
And I say to young kids everywhere , as you &apos;re growing up and as this structure is being developed inside of you , always be looking for that which you do well and that which you love doing , and when you find those two things together , man , you got it .
That &apos;s what &apos;s going on . And that &apos;s what I found .
Now the authorities at CCNY were getting tired of me being there .
I &apos;d been there four and a half going on five years , and my grades were not doing particularly well , and I was in occasional difficulties with the administration .
And so they said , &quot; But he does so well in ROTC .
Look , he gets straight A &apos;s in that but not in anything else . &quot;
And so they said , &quot; Look , let &apos;s take his ROTC grades and roll them into his overall GPA and see what happens . &quot;
And they did , and it brought me up to 2.0 .
Yep .
They said , &quot; It &apos;s good enough for government work .
Give him to the army . We &apos;ll never see him again . We &apos;ll never see him again . &quot;
So they shipped me off to the army , and lo and behold , many years later , I &apos;m considered one of the greatest sons the City College of New York has ever had .
So , I tell young people everywhere , it ain &apos;t where you start in life , it &apos;s what you do with life that determines where you end up in life , and you are blessed to be living in a country that , no matter where you start , you have opportunities so long as you believe in yourself , you believe in the society and the country , and you believe that you can self-improve and educate yourself as you go along .
And that &apos;s the key to success .
But it begins with the gift of a good start .
If we don &apos;t give that gift to each and every one of our kids , if we don &apos;t invest at the earliest age , we &apos;re going to be running into difficulties .
It &apos;s why we have a dropout rate of roughly 25 percent overall and almost 50 percent of our minority population living in low-income areas , because they &apos;re not getting the gift of a good start .
My gift of a good start was not only being in a nice family , a good family , but having a family that said to me , &quot; Now listen , we came to this country in banana boats in 1920 and 1924 .
We worked like dogs down in the garment industry every single day .
We &apos;re not doing it so that you can stick something up your nose or get in trouble . And don &apos;t even think about dropping out . &quot;
If I had ever gone home and told those immigrant people that , &quot; You know , I &apos;m tired of school and I &apos;m dropping out , &quot; they &apos;d said , &quot; We &apos;re dropping you out . We &apos;ll get another kid . &quot;
They had expectations for all of the cousins and the extended family of immigrants that lived in the South Bronx , but they had more than just expectations for us .
They stuck into our hearts like a dagger a sense of shame : &quot; Don &apos;t you shame this family . &quot;
Sometimes I would get in trouble , and my parents were coming home , and I was in my room waiting for what &apos;s going to happen , and I would sit there saying to myself , &quot; Okay , look , take the belt and hit me , but , God , don &apos;t give me that &apos; shame the family &apos; bit again . &quot;
It devastated me when my mother did that to me .
And I also had this extended network .
Children need a network . Children need to be part of a tribe , a family , a community .
In my case it was aunts who lived in all of these tenement buildings .
I don &apos;t know how many of you are New Yorkers , but there were these tenement buildings , and these women were always hanging out one of the windows , leaning on a pillow .
They never left .
I , so help me God , I grew up walking those streets , and they were always there .
They never went to the bathroom . They never cooked .
They never did anything .
But what they did was keep us in play .
They kept us in play .
And they didn &apos;t care whether you became a doctor or a lawyer or a general , and they never expected any generals in the family , as long as you got an education and then you got a job .
&quot; Don &apos;t give us any of that self-actualization stuff .
You get a job and get out of the house .
We don &apos;t have time to waste for that .
And then you can support us . That &apos;s the role of you guys . &quot;
And so , it &apos;s so essential that we kind of put this culture back into our families , all families .
And it is so important that all of you here today who are successful people , and I &apos;m sure have wonderful families and children and grandchildren , it &apos;s not enough . You &apos;ve got to reach out and back and find kids like Mr. Cruz who can make it if you give them the structure , if you reach back and help , if you mentor , if you invest in boys and girls clubs , if you work with your school system , make sure it &apos;s the best school system , and not just your kid &apos;s school , but the school uptown in Harlem , not just downtown Montessori on the West Side .
All of us have to have a commitment to do that .
And we &apos;re not just investing in the kids .
We &apos;re investing in our future .
We &apos;re going to be a minority-majority country in one more generation .
Those that we call minorities now are going to be the majority .
And we have to make sure that they are ready to be the majority .
We have to make sure they &apos;re ready to be the leaders of this great country of ours , a country that is like no other , a country that amazes me every single day , a country that &apos;s fractious . We &apos;re always arguing with each other .
That &apos;s how the system &apos;s supposed to work .
It &apos;s a country of such contrasts , but it &apos;s a nation of nations .
We touch every nation . Every nation touches us .
We are a nation of immigrants .
That &apos;s why we need sound immigration policy .
It &apos;s ridiculous not to have a sound immigration policy to welcome those who want to come here and be part of this great nation , or we can send back home with an education to help their people rise up out of poverty .
One of the great stories I love to tell is about my love of going to my hometown of New York and walking up Park Avenue on a beautiful day and admiring everything and seeing all the people go by from all over the world .
But what I always have to do is stop at one of the corners and get a hot dog from the immigrant pushcart peddler .
Gotta have a dirty water dog .
And no matter where I am or what I &apos;m doing , I &apos;ve got to do that .
I even did it when I was Secretary of State .
I &apos;d come out of my suite at the Waldorf Astoria — — be walking up the street , and I would hit around 55th Street looking for the immigrant pushcart peddler .
In those days , I had five bodyguards around me and three New York City police cars would roll alongside to make sure nobody whacked me while I was going up Park Avenue .
And I would order the hot dog from the guy , and he &apos;d start to fix it , and then he &apos;d look around at the bodyguards and the police cars -- &quot; I &apos;ve got a green card ! I &apos;ve got a green card ! &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s okay , it &apos;s okay . &quot;
But now I &apos;m alone . I &apos;m alone .
I &apos;ve got no bodyguards , I &apos;ve got no police cars . I &apos;ve got nothing .
But I gotta have my hot dog .
I did it just last week . It was on a Tuesday evening down by Columbus Circle .
And the scene repeats itself so often .
I &apos;ll go up and ask for my hot dog , and the guy will fix it , and as he &apos;s finishing , he &apos;ll say , &quot; I know you . I see you on television .
You &apos;re , well , you &apos;re General Powell . &quot;
&quot; Yes , yes . &quot; &quot; Oh ... &quot; I hand him the money .
&quot; No , General . You can &apos;t pay me . I &apos;ve been paid .
America has paid me . I never forget where I came from .
But now I &apos;m an American . Sir , thank you . &quot;
I accept the generosity , continue up the street , and it washes over me , my God , it &apos;s the same country that greeted my parents this way 90 years ago .
So we are still that magnificent country , but we are fueled by young people coming up from every land in the world , and it is our obligation as contributing citizens to this wonderful country of ours to make sure that no child gets left behind .
Thank you very much .

Angela Patton : A father-daughter dance ... in prison
I was sitting with my girls , and Joy said , &quot; Dang , I wish he &apos;d get off my back .
My daddy , he calls me all the time . &quot;
&quot; Lucky for you he calls at all , &quot; said Jasmine .
&quot; I haven &apos;t heard from my dad in years . &quot;
At this moment , I knew the girls needed a way to connect with their fathers .
At Camp Diva , my non-profit organization , we have these types of conversations all the time as a way to help girls of African descent prepare for their passage into womanhood .
These girls just needed a way to invite their fathers into their lives on their own terms .
So I asked the girls , &quot; How can we help other girls develop healthy relationships with their fathers ? &quot;
&quot; Let &apos;s have a dance , &quot; one girl shouted , and all the girls quickly backed her up .
They started dreaming about the decorations , invitations , the dresses they were going to wear , and what their fathers could and could not wear .
It was off and running before I could even blink my eyes , but even if I could have slowed down those girls , I wouldn &apos;t have , because one thing that I have learned from over a decade of working with girls is that they already know what they need .
The wisdom lives inside of them .
As long as they have infrastructure , mentorship and resources , they can build what they need , not only to survive , but to thrive .
So we had a dance , and girls and their fathers came in multitudes .
They were dressed to the nines .
They acted sweet .
They acted silly .
They really enjoyed each other &apos;s company .
It was a huge success .
And the girls decided to make it an annual event .
So as the seasons changed , and it was time to plan the dance again , one girl named Brianna spoke up , and she said , &quot; My dad can &apos;t come to the dance , and this whole thing is making me sad . &quot;
&quot; Why not ? &quot; the girls asked .
&quot; Because he &apos;s in jail , &quot; she bravely admitted .
&quot; Well , can he just get out for a day ? &quot; one of the girls asked .
&quot; And come in shackles ?
That &apos;s worse than not having him here at all . &quot;
At this moment , I saw an opportunity for the girls to rise to the occasion and to become their own heroes .
So I asked , &quot; What do you think we should do about this ?
We want every girl to experience the dance , right ? &quot;
So the girls thought for a moment , and one girl suggested , &quot; Why don &apos;t we just take the dance in the jail ? &quot;
Most of the girls doubted the possibility of that , and said , &quot; Are you crazy ?
Who is going to allow a bunch of little girls , dressed up — &quot; &quot; — to come inside a jail and dance with their daddies in Spongebob suits ? &quot;
Because that &apos;s what they called them .
I said , &quot; Girls , well , well , you never know unless you ask . &quot;
So a letter was written to the Richmond City Sheriff , signed collectively by each girl , and I would have to say , he is a very special sheriff .
He contacted me immediately and said , whenever there is an opportunity to bring families inside , his doors are always open .
Because one thing he did know , that when fathers are connected to their children , it is less likely that they will return .
So , 16 inmates and 18 girls were invited .
The girls were dressed in their Sunday best , and the fathers traded in their yellow and blue jumpsuits for shirts and ties .
They hugged .
They shared a full catered meal of chicken and fish .
They laughed together .
It was beautiful .
The fathers and daughters even experienced an opportunity to have a physical connection , something that a lot of them didn &apos;t even have for a while .
Fathers were in a space where they were able to make their daughters play , and pull out her chair and extend his hand for a dance .
Even the guards cried .
But after the dance , we all realized that Dad still would be in jail .
So we needed to create something that they could take with them .
So we brought in Flip cams , and we had them look at the Flip cams and just interview each other -- their messages , their thoughts .
This was going to be used as a touchstone so when they started to miss each other and feel disconnected , they could reconnect through this image .
I &apos;ll never forget that one girl looked in her father &apos;s eyes with that camera and said , &quot; Daddy , when you look at me , what do you see ? &quot;
Because our daddies are our mirrors that we reflect back on when we decide about what type of man we deserve , and how they see us for the rest of our lives .
I know that very well , because I was one of the lucky girls .
I have had my father in my life always .
He &apos;s even here today .
And that is why it is extremely special for me to make sure that these girls are connected to their fathers , especially those who are separated because of barbed wires and metal doors .
We have just created a form for girls who have heavy questions on their heart to be in a position to ask their fathers those questions and given the fathers the freedom to answer .
Because we know that the fathers are even leaving with this one thought : What type of woman am I preparing to put in the world ?
Because a father is locked in does not mean he should be locked out of his daughter &apos;s life .

Trinidad and Tobago amassed great wealth in the 1970s thanks to oil . But in 1982 , a shocking fact was revealed -- that 2 out of every 3 dollars earmarked for development had been wasted or stolen . This has haunted Afra Raymond for 30 years . Shining a flashlight on a continued history of government corruption , Raymond gives us a reframing of financial crime .

Afra Raymond : Three myths about corruption
Okay , this morning I &apos;m speaking on the question of corruption .
And corruption is defined as the abuse of a position of trust for the benefit of yourself -- or , in the case of our context , your friends , your family or your financiers .
Okay ? Friends , family and financiers .
But we need to understand what we understand about corruption , and we need to understand that we have been miseducated about it , and we have to admit that .
We have to have the courage to admit that to start changing how we deal with it .
The first thing is that the big myth , number one , is that in fact it &apos;s not really a crime .
When we get together with friends and family and we discuss crime in our country , crime in Belmont or crime in Diego or crime in Marabella , nobody &apos;s speaking about corruption .
That &apos;s the honest truth .
When the Commissioner of Police comes on TV to talk about crime , he isn &apos;t speaking about corruption .
And we know for sure when the Minister of National Security is speaking about crime , he &apos;s not talking about corruption either .
The point I &apos;m making is that it is a crime .
It is an economic crime , because we &apos;re involving the looting of taxpayers &apos; money .
Public and private corruption is a reality .
As somebody who comes from the private sector , I can tell you there &apos;s a massive amount of corruption in the private sector that has nothing to do with government .
The same bribes and backhanders and things that take place under the table , it all takes place in the private sector .
Today , I &apos;m focusing on public sector corruption , which the private sector also participates in .
The second important myth to understand -- because we have to destroy these myths , dismantle them and destroy them and ridicule them -- the second important myth to understand is the one that says that in fact corruption is only a small problem -- if it is a problem , it &apos;s only a small problem , that in fact it &apos;s only a little 10 or 15 percent , it &apos;s been going on forever , it probably will continue forever , and there &apos;s no point passing any laws , because there &apos;s little we can do about it .
And I want to demonstrate that that , too , is a dangerous myth , very dangerous .
It &apos;s a piece of public mischief .
And I want to speak a little bit , take us back about 30 years .
We &apos;re coming out today from Trinidad and Tobago , a resource-rich , small Caribbean country , and in the early 1970s we had a massive increase in the country &apos;s wealth , and that increase was caused by the increase in world oil prices .
We call them petrodollars . The treasury was bursting with money .
And it &apos;s ironic , because we &apos;re standing today in the Central Bank .
You see , history &apos;s rich in irony .
We &apos;re standing today in the Central Bank , and the Central Bank is responsible for a lot of the things I &apos;m going to be speaking about .
Okay ? We &apos;re talking about irresponsibility in public office .
We &apos;re speaking about the fact that across the terrace , the next tower is the Ministry of Finance , and there &apos;s a lot of connection with us today , so we &apos;re speaking within your temple today . Okay ?
The first thing I want to talk about is that when all of this money flowed into our country about 40 years ago , we embarked , the government of the day embarked on a series of government-to-government arrangements to have rapidly develop the country .
And some of the largest projects in the country were being constructed through government-to-government arrangements with some of the leading countries in the world , the United States and Britain and France and so on and so on .
As I said , even this building we &apos;re standing in -- that &apos;s one of the ironies -- this building was part of that series of complexes , what they called the Twin Towers .
It became so outrageous , the whole situation , that in fact a commission of inquiry was appointed , and it reported in 1982 , 30 years ago it reported -- the Ballah Report -- 30 years ago , and immediately the government-to-government arrangements were stopped .
The then-Prime Minister went to Parliament to give a budget speech , and he said some things that I &apos;ll never forget .
They went right in here . I was a young man at the time .
It went right into my heart .
And he said that , in fact — Let me see if this thing works .
Are we getting a , yeah ? — That &apos;s what he told us .
He told us that , in fact , two out of every three dollars of our petrodollars that we spent , the taxpayers &apos; money , was wasted or stolen .
So the 10 or 15 percent is pure mischief .
As we say , it &apos;s a nancy-story . Forget it .
That &apos;s for little children . We are big people , and we &apos;re trying to deal with what &apos;s happening in our society .
Okay ? This is the size of the problem .
Okay ? Two thirds of the money stolen or wasted .
That was 30 years ago . 1982 was Ballah .
So what has changed ?
I don &apos;t like to bring up embarrassing secrets to an international audience , but I have to .
Four months ago , we suffered a constitutional outrage in this country .
We call it the Section 34 fiasco , the Section 34 fiasco , a suspicious piece of law , and I &apos;m going to say it like it is , a suspicious piece of law was passed at a suspicious time to free some suspects .
And it was called , those people are called the Piarco Airport accused .
I &apos;m going to have my own lexicon speaking here today .
They are the Piarco Airport accused .
It was a constitutional outrage of the first order , and I have labeled it the Plot to Pervert Parliament .
Our highest institution in our country was perverted .
We are dealing with perverts here of an economic and financial nature .
Do you get how serious this problem is ?
There was massive protest . A lot of us in this room took part in the protest in different forms .
Most importantly , the American embassy complained , so Parliament was swiftly reconvened , and the law was reversed , it was repealed .
That &apos;s the word lawyers use . It was repealed .
But the point is that Parliament was outwitted in the whole course of events , because what really happened is that , because of the suspicious passage of that law , the law was actually passed into effect on the weekend we celebrated our 50th anniversary of independence , our jubilee of independence .
So that is the kind of outrage of the thing .
It was kind of a nasty way to get maturation , but we got it , because we all understood it , and for the first time that I could remember , there were mass protests against this corruption .
And that gave me a lot of hope . Okay ?
Those of us who are , sometimes you feel like you &apos;re a little bit on your own doing some of this work .
That passage of the law and the repeal of the law fortified the case of the Piarco Airport accused .
So it was one of those really superior double bluff kind of things that took place .
But what were they accused of ?
What was it that they were accused of ?
I &apos;m being a bit mysterious for those of you out there . What were they accused of ?
We were trying to build , or reconstruct largely , an airport that had grown outdated .
The entire project cost about 1.6 billion dollars , Trinidad and Tobago dollars , and in fact , we had a lot of bid-rigging and suspicious activity , corrupt activity took place .
And to get an idea of what it consisted of , and to put it in context in relationship to this whole second myth about it being no big thing , we can look at this second slide here .
And what we have here -- I am not saying so , this is the Director of Public Prosecutions in a written statement . He said so .
And he &apos;s telling us that for the $ 1.6 billion cost of the project , one billion dollars has been traced to offshore bank accounts .
One billion dollars of our taxpayers &apos; money has been located in offshore bank accounts .
Being the kind of suspicious person I am , I am outraged at that , and I &apos;m going to pause here , I &apos;m going to pause now and again and bring in different things .
I &apos;m going to pause here and bring in something I saw in November last year at Wall Street . I was at Zuccotti Park .
It was autumn . It was cool . It was damp . It was getting dark .
And I was walking around with the protesters looking at the One Wall Street , Occupy Wall Street movement walking around .
And there was a lady with a sign , a very simple sign , a kind of battered-looking blonde lady , and the sign was made out of Bristol board , as we say in these parts , and it was made with a marker .
And what it said on that sign hit me right in the center .
It said , &quot; If you &apos;re not outraged , you haven &apos;t been paying attention . &quot;
If you &apos;re not outraged by all of this , you haven &apos;t been paying attention .
So listen up , because we &apos;re getting into even deeper waters .
My brain started thinking .
Well , what if -- because I &apos;m suspicious like that . I read a lot of spy novels and stuff .
What if -- But to make it in these wrongs , you have to read a lot of spy novels and follow some of that stuff , right ?
But what if this wasn &apos;t the first time ?
What if this is just the first time that the so-and-sos had been caught ?
What if it had happened before ? How would I find out ?
Now , the previous two examples I gave were to do with construction sector corruption , okay ?
And I have the privilege at this time to lead the Joint Consultative Council , which is a not-for-profit .
We &apos;re at jcc.org.tt , and we have the -- we are the leaders in the struggle to produce a new public procurement system about how public money is transacted .
So those of you interested in finding out more about it , or joining us or signing up on any of our petitions , please get involved .
But I &apos;m going to segue to another thing that relates , because one of my private campaigns I &apos;ve been conducting for over three and a half years is for transparency and accountability around the bailout of CL Financial .
CL Financial is the Caribbean &apos;s largest ever conglomerate , okay ?
And without getting into all of the details , it is said to have collapsed — I &apos;m using my words very carefully — it &apos;s said to have collapsed in January of &apos; 09 , which is just coming up to nearly four years .
In an unprecedented fit of generosity -- and you have to be very suspicious about these people -- in an unprecedented — and I &apos;m using that word carefully — unprecedented fit of generosity , the government of the day signed , made a written commitment , to repay all of the creditors .
And I can tell you without fear of contradiction that hasn &apos;t happened anywhere else on the planet .
Let &apos;s understand , because we lack context .
People are telling us it &apos;s just like Wall Street . It &apos;s not just like Wall Street .
Trinidad and Tobago is like a place with different laws of physics or biology or something .
It &apos;s not just like anywhere .
It &apos;s not just like anywhere . It &apos;s not just like anywhere .
Here is here , and out there is out there . Okay ?
I &apos;m serious now .
Listen . They &apos;ve had bailouts on Wall Street .
They &apos;ve had bailouts in London .
They &apos;ve had bailouts in Europe .
In Africa , they &apos;ve had bailouts . In Nigeria , six of the major commercial banks collapsed at the same time as ours , eh ?
It &apos;s interesting to parallel how the Nigerian experience has -- how they &apos;ve treated it , and they &apos;ve treated it very well compared to us .
Nowhere on the planet have all the creditors been bailed out in excess of what their statutory entitlements were .
Only here . So what was the reason for the generosity ?
Is our government that generous ? And maybe they are .
Let &apos;s look at it . Let &apos;s look into it .
So I started digging and writing and so and so on , and that work can be found , my personal work can be found at AfraRaymond.com , which is my name .
It &apos;s a not-for-profit blog that I run .
Not as popular as some of the other people , but there you go .
But the point is that the bitter experience of Section 34 , that plot to pervert Parliament , that bitter experience that took place in August , when we were supposed to be celebrating our independence , going into September , forced me to check myself and recalculate my bearings , and to go back into some of the work , some of the stuff I &apos;d written and some of the exchanges I &apos;d had with the officials to see what was really what .
As we say in Trinidad and Tobago , who is who and what is what ?
Okay ? We want to try to recalculate .
And I made a Freedom of Information application in May this year to the Ministry of Finance .
The Ministry of Finance is the next tower over .
This is the other context .
The Ministry of Finance , we are told , is subject to the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act .
I &apos;m going to take you through a worked example of whether that &apos;s really so .
The Central Bank in which we stand this morning is immune from the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act .
So in fact , you can &apos;t ask them anything , and they don &apos;t have to answer anything .
That is the law since 1999 .
So I plunged into this struggle , and I asked four questions .
And I &apos;ll relate the questions to you in the short form with the reply , so you could understand , as I said , where we are .
Here is not like anywhere else .
Question number one : I asked to see the accounts of CL Financial , and if you can &apos;t show me the accounts -- the Minister of Finance is making statements , passing new laws and giving speeches and so on .
What are the figures he &apos;s relying on ?
It &apos;s like that joke : I want whatever he &apos;s drinking .
And they wrote back and said to me , well what do you really mean ?
So they hit my question with a question .
Second point : I want to see who are the creditors of the group who have been repaid ?
Let me pause here to point out to you all that 24 billion dollars of our money has been spent on this .
That is about three and a half billion U.S. dollars coming out of a small -- we used to be resource-rich -- Caribbean country . Okay ?
And I asked the question , who was getting that three and a half billion dollars ?
And I want to pause again to bring up context , because context helps us to get clarity understanding this thing .
There &apos;s a particular individual who is in the government now .
The name of the person doesn &apos;t matter .
And that person made a career out of using the Freedom of Information Act to advance his political cause .
Okay ? His name isn &apos;t important .
I wouldn &apos;t dignify it . I &apos;m on a point .
The point is , that person made a career out of using the Freedom of Information Act to advance his cause .
And the most famous case was what we came to call the Secret Scholarship Scandal , where in fact there was about 60 million dollars in government money that had been dispersed in a series of scholarships , and the scholarships hadn &apos;t been advertised , and so and so on and so on .
And he was able to get the court , using that act of Parliament , Freedom of Information Act , to release the information , and I thought that was excellent .
Fantastic .
But you see , the question is this : If it &apos;s right and proper for us to use the Freedom of Information Act and to use the court to force a disclosure about 60 million dollars in public money , it must be right and proper for us to force a disclosure about 24 billion dollars .
You see ? But the Ministry of Finance , the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Finance , wrote me and said to me , that information is exempt too .
You see ? This is what we &apos;re dealing with , okay ?
The third thing I will tell you is that I also asked for the directors of CL Financial , whether in fact they were making filings under our Integrity in Public Life Act .
We have an Integrity in Public Life Act as part of our framework supposed to safeguard the nation &apos;s interest .
And public officials are supposed to file to say what it is they have in terms of assets and liabilities .
And of course I &apos;ve since discovered that they &apos;re not filing , and in fact the Minister of Finance has not even asked them to file .
So here we have it . We have a situation where the basic safeguards of integrity and accountability and transparency have all been discarded .
I &apos;ve asked the question in the legal and required fashion .
It &apos;s been ignored .
The sort of thing that motivated us around Section 34 , we need to continue to work on that . We can &apos;t forget it .
I have defined this as the single largest expenditure in the country &apos;s history .
It &apos;s also the single largest example of public corruption according to this equation .
And this is my reality check .
Where you have an expenditure of public money and it is without accountability and it &apos;s without transparency , it will always be equal to corruption , whether you &apos;re in Russia or Nigeria or Alaska , it will always be equal to corruption , and that is what we are dealing with here .
I &apos;m going to continue the work to press on , to get some resolution of those matters at the Ministry of Finance .
If it is I have to go to court personally , I will do that .
We will continue to press on .
We will continue to work within JCC .
But I want to step back from the Trinidad and Tobago context and bring something new to the table in terms of an international example .
We had the journalist &#91; Heather &#93; Brooke speaking about her battle against government corruption , and she introduced me to this website , Alaveteli.com.
And Alaveteli.com is a way for us to have an open database for Freedom of Information applications , and speak with each other .
I could see what you &apos;re applying for .
You could see what I applied for and what replies I got .
We can work on it together . We need to build a collective database and a collective understanding of where we are to go to the next point .
We need to increase the consciousness .
The final thing I want to say is in relation to this one , which is a lovely website from India called IPaidABribe.com.
They have international branches , and it &apos;s important for us to tune into this one .
IPaidABribe.com is really important , a good one to log on to and see .
I &apos;m going to pause there . I &apos;m going to ask you for your courage .
Discard the first myth ; it is a crime .
Discard the second myth ; it is a big thing .
It &apos;s a huge problem . It &apos;s an economic crime .
And let us continue working together to betterment in this situation , stability and sustainability in our society .

Artist iO Tillett Wright has photographed 2,000 people who consider themselves somewhere on the LBGTQ spectrum and asked many of them : Can you assign a percentage to how gay or straight you are ? Most people , it turns out , consider themselves to exist in the gray areas of sexuality , not 100 % gay or straight . Which presents a real problem when it comes to discrimination : Where do you draw the line ?

iO Tillett Wright : Fifty shades of gay
Human beings start putting each other into boxes the second that they see each other -- Is that person dangerous ? Are they attractive ?
Are they a potential mate ? Are they a potential networking opportunity ?
We do this little interrogation when we meet people to make a mental resume for them .
What &apos;s your name ? Where are you from ?
How old are you ? What do you do ?
Then we get more personal with it .
Have you ever had any diseases ?
Have you ever been divorced ?
Does your breath smell bad while you &apos;re answering my interrogation right now ?
What are you into ? Who are you into ?
What gender do you like to sleep with ?
I get it .
We are neurologically hardwired to seek out people like ourselves .
We start forming cliques as soon as we &apos;re old enough to know what acceptance feels like .
We bond together based on anything that we can -- music preference , race , gender , the block that we grew up on .
We seek out environments that reinforce our personal choices .
Sometimes , though , just the question &quot; what do you do ? &quot;
can feel like somebody &apos;s opening a tiny little box and asking you to squeeze yourself inside of it .
Because the categories , I &apos;ve found , are too limiting .
The boxes are too narrow .
And this can get really dangerous .
So here &apos;s a disclaimer about me , though , before we get too deep into this .
I grew up in a very sheltered environment .
I was raised in downtown Manhattan in the early 1980s , two blocks from the epicenter of punk music .
I was shielded from the pains of bigotry and the social restrictions of a religiously-based upbringing .
Where I come from , if you weren &apos;t a drag queen or a radical thinker or a performance artist of some kind , you were the weirdo .
It was an unorthodox upbringing , but as a kid on the streets of New York , you learn how to trust your own instincts , you learn how to go with your own ideas .
So when I was six , I decided that I wanted to be a boy .
I went to school one day and the kids wouldn &apos;t let me play basketball with them .
They said they wouldn &apos;t let girls play .
So I went home , and I shaved my head , and I came back the next day and I said , &quot; I &apos;m a boy . &quot;
I mean , who knows , right ?
When you &apos;re six , maybe you can do that .
I didn &apos;t want anyone to know that I was a girl , and they didn &apos;t .
I kept up the charade for eight years .
So this is me when I was 11 .
I was playing a kid named Walter in a movie called &quot; Julian Po . &quot;
I was a little street tough that followed Christian Slater around and badgered him .
See , I was also a child actor , which doubled up the layers of the performance of my identity , because no one knew that I was actually a girl really playing a boy .
In fact , no one in my life knew that I was a girl -- not my teachers at school , not my friends , not the directors that I worked with .
Kids would often come up to me in class and grab me by the throat to check for an Adam &apos;s apple or grab my crotch to check what I was working with .
When I would go to the bathroom , I would turn my shoes around in the stalls so that it looked like I was peeing standing up .
At sleepovers I would have panic attacks trying to break it to girls that they didn &apos;t want to kiss me without outing myself .
It &apos;s worth mentioning though that I didn &apos;t hate my body or my genitalia .
I didn &apos;t feel like I was in the wrong body .
I felt like I was performing this elaborate act .
I wouldn &apos;t have qualified as transgender .
If my family , though , had been the kind of people to believe in therapy , they probably would have diagnosed me as something like gender dysmorphic and put me on hormones to stave off puberty .
But in my particular case , I just woke up one day when I was 14 , and I decided that I wanted to be a girl again .
Puberty had hit , and I had no idea what being a girl meant , and I was ready to figure out who I actually was .
When a kid behaves like I did , they don &apos;t exactly have to come out , right ?
No one is exactly shocked .
But I wasn &apos;t asked to define myself by my parents .
When I was 15 , and I called my father to tell him that I had fallen in love , it was the last thing on either of our minds to discuss what the consequences were of the fact that my first love was a girl .
Three years later , when I fell in love with a man , neither of my parents batted an eyelash either .
See , it &apos;s one of the great blessings of my very unorthodox childhood that I wasn &apos;t ever asked to define myself as any one thing at any point .
I was just allowed to be me , growing and changing in every moment .
So four , almost five years ago , Proposition 8 , the great marriage equality debate , was raising a lot of dust around this country .
And at the time , getting married wasn &apos;t really something I spent a lot of time thinking about .
But I was struck by the fact that America , a country with such a tarnished civil rights record , could be repeating its mistakes so blatantly .
And I remember watching the discussion on television and thinking how interesting it was that the separation of church and state was essentially drawing geographical boundaries throughout this country , between places where people believed in it and places where people didn &apos;t .
And then , that this discussion was drawing geographical boundaries around me .
If this was a war with two disparate sides , I , by default , fell on team gay , because I certainly wasn &apos;t 100 percent straight .
At the time I was just beginning to emerge from this eight-year personal identity crisis zigzag that saw me go from being a boy to being this awkward girl that looked like a boy in girl &apos;s clothes to the opposite extreme of this super skimpy , over-compensating , boy-chasing girly-girl to finally just a hesitant exploration of what I actually was , a tomboyish girl who liked both boys and girls depending on the person .
I had spent a year photographing this new generation of girls , much like myself , who fell kind of between-the-lines -- girls who skateboarded but did it in lacy underwear , girls who had boys &apos; haircuts but wore girly nail polish , girls who had eyeshadow to match their scraped knees , girls who liked girls and boys who all liked boys and girls who all hated being boxed in to anything .
I loved these people , and I admired their freedom , but I watched as the world outside of our utopian bubble exploded into these raging debates where pundits started likening our love to bestiality on national television .
And this powerful awareness rolled in over me that I was a minority , and in my own home country , based on one facet of my character .
I was legally and indisputably a second-class citizen .
I was not an activist .
I wave no flags in my own life .
But I was plagued by this question : How could anyone vote to strip the rights of the vast variety of people that I knew based on one element of their character ?
How could they say that we as a group were not deserving of equal rights as somebody else ?
Were we even a group ? What group ?
And had these people ever even consciously met a victim of their discrimination ?
Did they know who they were voting against and what the impact was ?
And then it occurred to me , perhaps if they could look into the eyes of the people that they were casting into second-class citizenship it might make it harder for them to do .
It might give them pause .
Obviously I couldn &apos;t get 20 million people to the same dinner party , so I figured out a way where I could introduce them to each other photographically without any artifice , without any lighting , or without any manipulation of any kind on my part .
Because in a photograph you can examine a lion &apos;s whiskers without the fear of him ripping your face off .
For me , photography is not just about exposing film , it &apos;s about exposing the viewer to something new , a place they haven &apos;t gone before , but most importantly , to people that they might be afraid of .
Life magazine introduced generations of people to distant , far-off cultures they never knew existed through pictures .
So I decided to make a series of very simple portraits , mugshots if you will .
And I basically decided to photograph anyone in this country that was not 100 percent straight , which , if you don &apos;t know , is a limitless number of people .
So this was a very large undertaking , and to do it we needed some help .
So I ran out in the freezing cold , and I photographed every single person that I knew that I could get to in February of about two years ago .
And I took those photographs , and I went to the HRC and I asked them for some help .
And they funded two weeks of shooting in New York .
And then we made this .
I &apos;m iO Tillett Wright , and I &apos;m an artist born and raised in New York City .
Self Evident Truths is a photographic record of LGBTQ America today .
My aim is to take a simple portrait of anyone who &apos;s anything other than 100 percent straight or feels like they fall in the LGBTQ spectrum in any way .
My goal is to show the humanity that exists in every one of us through the simplicity of a face .
&quot; We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal . &quot;
It &apos;s written in the Declaration of Independence .
We are failing as a nation to uphold the morals upon which we were founded .
There is no equality in the United States .
&#91; &quot; What does equality mean to you ? &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; Marriage &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; Freedom &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; Civil rights &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; Treat every person as you &apos;d treat yourself &quot; &#93; It &apos;s when you don &apos;t have to think about it , simple as that .
The fight for equal rights is not just about gay marriage .
Today in 29 states , more than half of this country , you can legally be fired just for your sexuality .
&#91; &quot; Who is responsible for equality ? &quot; &#93; I &apos;ve heard hundreds of people give the same answer : &quot; We are all responsible for equality . &quot;
So far we &apos;ve shot 300 faces in New York City .
And we wouldn &apos;t have been able to do any of it without the generous support of the Human Rights Campaign .
I want to take the project across the country .
I want to visit 25 American cities , and I want to shoot 4,000 or 5,000 people .
This is my contribution to the civil rights fight of my generation .
I challenge you to look into the faces of these people and tell them that they deserve less than any other human being .
Absolutely nothing could have prepared us for what happened after that .
Almost 85,000 people watched that video , and then they started emailing us from all over the country , asking us to come to their towns and help them to show their faces .
And a lot more people wanted to show their faces than I had anticipated .
So I changed my immediate goal to 10,000 faces .
That video was made in the spring of 2011 , and as of today I have traveled to almost 20 cities and photographed almost 2,000 people .
I know that this is a talk , but I &apos;d like to have a minute of just quiet and have you just look at these faces because there is nothing that I can say that will add to them .
Because if a picture is worth a thousand words , then a picture of a face needs a whole new vocabulary .
So after traveling and talking to people in places like Oklahoma or small-town Texas , we found evidence that the initial premise was dead on .
Visibility really is key .
Familiarity really is the gateway drug to empathy .
Once an issue pops up in your own backyard or amongst your own family , you &apos;re far more likely to explore sympathy for it or explore a new perspective on it .
Of course , in my travels I met people who legally divorced their children for being other than straight , but I also met people who were Southern Baptists who switched churches because their child was a lesbian .
Sparking empathy had become the backbone of Self Evident Truths .
But here &apos;s what I was starting to learn that was really interesting : Self Evident Truths doesn &apos;t erase the differences between us .
In fact , on the contrary , it highlights them .
It presents , not just the complexities found in a procession of different human beings , but the complexities found within each individual person .
It wasn &apos;t that we had too many boxes , it was that we had too few .
At some point I realized that my mission to photograph &quot; gays &quot; was inherently flawed , because there were a million different shades of gay .
Here I was trying to help , and I had perpetuated the very thing I had spent my life trying to avoid -- yet another box .
At some point I added a question to the release form that asked people to quantify themselves on a scale of one to 100 percent gay .
And I watched so many existential crises unfold in front of me .
People didn &apos;t know what to do because they had never been presented with the option before .
Can you quantify your openness ?
Once they got over the shock , though , by and large people opted for somewhere between 70 to 95 percent or the 3 to 20 percent marks .
Of course , there were lots of people who opted for a 100 percent one or the other , but I found that a much larger proportion of people identified as something that was much more nuanced .
I found that most people fall on a spectrum of what I have come to refer to as &quot; Grey . &quot;
Let me be clear though -- and this is very important -- in no way am I saying that preference doesn &apos;t exist .
And I am not even going to address the issue of choice versus biological imperative , because if any of you happen to be of the belief that sexual orientation is a choice , I invite you to go out and try to be grey .
I &apos;ll take your picture just for trying .
What I am saying though is that human beings are not one-dimensional .
The most important thing to take from the percentage system is this : If you have gay people over here and you have straight people over here , and while we recognize that most people identify as somewhere closer to one binary or another , there is this vast spectrum of people that exist in between .
And the reality that this presents is a complicated one .
Because , for example , if you pass a law that allows a boss to fire an employee for homosexual behavior , where exactly do you draw the line ?
Is it over here , by the people who have had one or two heterosexual experiences so far ?
Or is it over here by the people who have only had one or two homosexual experiences thus far ?
Where exactly does one become a second-class citizen ?
Another interesting thing that I learned from my project and my travels is just what a poor binding agent sexual orientation is .
After traveling so much and meeting so many people , let me tell you , there are just as many jerks and sweethearts and Democrats and Republicans and jocks and queens and every other polarization you can possibly think of within the LGBT community as there are within the human race .
Aside from the fact that we play with one legal hand tied behind our backs , and once you get past the shared narrative of prejudice and struggle , just being other than straight doesn &apos;t necessarily mean that we have anything in common .
So in the endless proliferation of faces that Self Evident Truths is always becoming , as it hopefully appears across more and more platforms , bus shelters , billboards , Facebook pages , screen savers , perhaps in watching this procession of humanity , something interesting and useful will begin to happen .
Hopefully these categories , these binaries , these over-simplified boxes will begin to become useless and they &apos;ll begin to fall away .
Because really , they describe nothing that we see and no one that we know and nothing that we are .
What we see are human beings in all their multiplicity .
And seeing them makes it harder to deny their humanity .
At the very least I hope it makes it harder to deny their human rights .
So is it me particularly that you would choose to deny the right to housing , the right to adopt children , the right to marriage , the freedom to shop here , live here , buy here ?
Am I the one that you choose to disown as your child or your brother or your sister or your mother or your father , your neighbor , your cousin , your uncle , the president , your police woman or the fireman ?
It &apos;s too late .
Because I already am all of those things .
We already are all of those things , and we always have been .
So please don &apos;t greet us as strangers , greet us as your fellow human beings , period .
Thank you .

Leslie Morgan Steiner : Why domestic violence victims don &apos;t leave
I &apos;m here today to talk about a disturbing question , which has an equally disturbing answer .
My topic is the secrets of domestic violence , and the question I &apos;m going to tackle is the one question everyone always asks : Why does she stay ?
Why would anyone stay with a man who beats her ?
I &apos;m not a psychiatrist , a social worker or an expert in domestic violence .
I &apos;m just one woman with a story to tell .
I was 22 . I had just graduated from Harvard College .
I had moved to New York City for my first job as a writer and editor at Seventeen magazine .
I had my first apartment , my first little green American Express card , and I had a very big secret .
My secret was that I had this gun loaded with hollow-point bullets pointed at my head by the man who I thought was my soulmate , many , many times .
The man who I loved more than anybody on Earth held a gun to my head and threatened to kill me more times than I can even remember .
I &apos;m here to tell you the story of crazy love , a psychological trap disguised as love , one that millions of women and even a few men fall into every year .
It may even be your story .
I don &apos;t look like a typical domestic violence survivor .
I have a B.A. in English from Harvard College , an MBA in marketing from Wharton Business School .
I &apos;ve spent most of my career working for Fortune 500 companies including Johnson &amp; Johnson , Leo Burnett and The Washington Post .
I &apos;ve been married for almost 20 years to my second husband and we have three kids together .
My dog is a black lab , and I drive a Honda Odyssey minivan .
So my first message for you is that domestic violence happens to everyone -- all races , all religions , all income and education levels .
It &apos;s everywhere .
And my second message is that everyone thinks domestic violence happens to women , that it &apos;s a women &apos;s issue .
Not exactly .
Over 85 percent of abusers are men , and domestic abuse happens only in intimate , interdependent , long-term relationships , in other words , in families , the last place we would want or expect to find violence , which is one reason domestic abuse is so confusing .
I would have told you myself that I was the last person on Earth who would stay with a man who beats me , but in fact I was a very typical victim because of my age .
I was 22 , and in the United States , women ages 16 to 24 are three times as likely to be domestic violence victims as women of other ages , and over 500 women and girls this age are killed every year by abusive partners , boyfriends , and husbands in the United States .
I was also a very typical victim because I knew nothing about domestic violence , its warning signs or its patterns .
I met Conor on a cold , rainy January night .
He sat next to me on the New York City subway , and he started chatting me up .
He told me two things .
One was that he , too , had just graduated from an Ivy League school , and that he worked at a very impressive Wall Street bank .
But what made the biggest impression on me that first meeting was that he was smart and funny and he looked like a farm boy .
He had these big cheeks , these big apple cheeks and this wheat-blond hair , and he seemed so sweet .
One of the smartest things Conor did , from the very beginning , was to create the illusion that I was the dominant partner in the relationship .
He did this especially at the beginning by idolizing me .
We started dating , and he loved everything about me , that I was smart , that I &apos;d gone to Harvard , that I was passionate about helping teenage girls , and my job .
He wanted to know everything about my family and my childhood and my hopes and dreams .
Conor believed in me , as a writer and a woman , in a way that no one else ever had .
And he also created a magical atmosphere of trust between us by confessing his secret , which was that , as a very young boy starting at age four , he had been savagely and repeatedly physically abused by his stepfather , and the abuse had gotten so bad that he had had to drop out of school in eighth grade , even though he was very smart , and he &apos;d spent almost 20 years rebuilding his life .
Which is why that Ivy League degree and the Wall Street job and his bright shiny future meant so much to him .
If you had told me that this smart , funny , sensitive man who adored me would one day dictate whether or not I wore makeup , how short my skirts were , where I lived , what jobs I took , who my friends were and where I spent Christmas , I would have laughed at you , because there was not a hint of violence or control or anger in Conor at the beginning .
I didn &apos;t know that the first stage in any domestic violence relationship is to seduce and charm the victim .
I also didn &apos;t know that the second step is to isolate the victim .
Now , Conor did not come home one day and announce , &quot; You know , hey , all this Romeo and Juliet stuff has been great , but I need to move into the next phase where I isolate you and I abuse you &quot; — — &quot; so I need to get you out of this apartment where the neighbors can hear you scream and out of this city where you have friends and family and coworkers who can see the bruises . &quot;
Instead , Conor came home one Friday evening and he told me that he had quit his job that day , his dream job , and he said that he had quit his job because of me , because I had made him feel so safe and loved that he didn &apos;t need to prove himself on Wall Street anymore , and he just wanted to get out of the city and away from his abusive , dysfunctional family , and move to a tiny town in New England where he could start his life over with me by his side .
Now , the last thing I wanted to do was leave New York , and my dream job , but I thought you made sacrifices for your soulmate , so I agreed , and I quit my job , and Conor and I left Manhattan together .
I had no idea I was falling into crazy love , that I was walking headfirst into a carefully laid physical , financial and psychological trap .
The next step in the domestic violence pattern is to introduce the threat of violence and see how she reacts .
And here &apos;s where those guns come in .
As soon as we moved to New England -- you know , that place where Connor was supposed to feel so safe -- he bought three guns .
He kept one in the glove compartment of our car .
He kept one under the pillows on our bed , and the third one he kept in his pocket at all times .
And he said that he needed those guns because of the trauma he &apos;d experienced as a young boy .
He needed them to feel protected .
But those guns were really a message for me , and even though he hadn &apos;t raised a hand to me , my life was already in grave danger every minute of every day .
Conor first physically attacked me five days before our wedding .
It was 7 a.m. I still had on my nightgown .
I was working on my computer trying to finish a freelance writing assignment , and I got frustrated , and Conor used my anger as an excuse to put both of his hands around my neck and to squeeze so tightly that I could not breathe or scream , and he used the chokehold to hit my head repeatedly against the wall .
Five days later , the ten bruises on my neck had just faded , and I put on my mother &apos;s wedding dress , and I married him .
Despite what had happened , I was sure we were going to live happily ever after , because I loved him , and he loved me so much .
And he was very , very sorry .
He had just been really stressed out by the wedding and by becoming a family with me .
It was an isolated incident , and he was never going to hurt me again .
It happened twice more on the honeymoon .
The first time , I was driving to find a secret beach and I got lost , and he punched me in the side of my head so hard that the other side of my head repeatedly hit the driver &apos;s side window .
And then a few days later , driving home from our honeymoon , he got frustrated by traffic , and he threw a cold Big Mac in my face .
Conor proceeded to beat me once or twice a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage .
I was mistaken in thinking that I was unique and alone in this situation .
One in three American women experiences domestic violence or stalking at some point in her life , and the CDC reports that 15 million children are abused every year , 15 million .
So actually , I was in very good company .
Back to my question : Why did I stay ?
The answer is easy .
I didn &apos;t know he was abusing me .
Even though he held those loaded guns to my head , pushed me down stairs , threatened to kill our dog , pulled the key out of the car ignition as I drove down the highway , poured coffee grinds on my head as I dressed for a job interview , I never once thought of myself as a battered wife .
Instead , I was a very strong woman in love with a deeply troubled man , and I was the only person on Earth who could help Conor face his demons .
The other question everybody asks is , why doesn &apos;t she just leave ?
Why didn &apos;t I walk out ? I could have left any time .
To me , this is the saddest and most painful question that people ask , because we victims know something you usually don &apos;t : It &apos;s incredibly dangerous to leave an abuser .
Because the final step in the domestic violence pattern is kill her .
Over 70 percent of domestic violence murders happen after the victim has ended the relationship , after she &apos;s gotten out , because then the abuser has nothing left to lose .
Other outcomes include long-term stalking , even after the abuser remarries ; denial of financial resources ; and manipulation of the family court system to terrify the victim and her children , who are regularly forced by family court judges to spend unsupervised time with the man who beat their mother .
And still we ask , why doesn &apos;t she just leave ?
I was able to leave , because of one final , sadistic beating that broke through my denial .
I realized that the man who I loved so much was going to kill me if I let him .
So I broke the silence .
I told everyone : the police , my neighbors , my friends and family , total strangers , and I &apos;m here today because you all helped me .
We tend to stereotype victims as grisly headlines , self-destructive women , damaged goods .
The question , &quot; Why does she stay ? &quot;
is code for some people for , &quot; It &apos;s her fault for staying , &quot; as if victims intentionally choose to fall in love with men intent upon destroying us .
But since publishing &quot; Crazy Love , &quot; I have heard hundreds of stories from men and women who also got out , who learned an invaluable life lesson from what happened , and who rebuilt lives -- joyous , happy lives -- as employees , wives and mothers , lives completely free of violence , like me .
Because it turns out that I &apos;m actually a very typical domestic violence victim and a typical domestic violence survivor .
I remarried a kind and gentle man , and we have those three kids .
I have that black lab , and I have that minivan .
What I will never have again , ever , is a loaded gun held to my head by someone who says that he loves me .
Right now , maybe you &apos;re thinking , &quot; Wow , this is fascinating , &quot; or , &quot; Wow , how stupid was she , &quot; but this whole time , I &apos;ve actually been talking about you .
I promise you there are several people listening to me right now who are currently being abused or who were abused as children or who are abusers themselves .
Abuse could be affecting your daughter , your sister , your best friend right now .
I was able to end my own crazy love story by breaking the silence .
I &apos;m still breaking the silence today .
It &apos;s my way of helping other victims , and it &apos;s my final request of you .
Talk about what you heard here .
Abuse thrives only in silence .
You have the power to end domestic violence simply by shining a spotlight on it .
We victims need everyone .
We need every one of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence .
Show abuse the light of day by talking about it with your children , your coworkers , your friends and family .
Recast survivors as wonderful , lovable people with full futures .
Recognize the early signs of violence and conscientiously intervene , deescalate it , show victims a safe way out .
Together we can make our beds , our dinner tables and our families the safe and peaceful oases they should be .
Thank you .

Imagine you &apos;re a shipwrecked sailor adrift in the enormous Pacific . You can choose one of three directions and save yourself and your shipmates -- but each choice comes with a fearful consequence too . How do you choose ? In telling the story of the whaleship Essex , novelist Karen Thompson Walker shows how fear propels imagination , as it forces us to imagine the possible futures and how to cope with them .

Karen Thompson Walker : What fear can teach us
One day in 1819 , 3,000 miles off the coast of Chile , in one of the most remote regions of the Pacific Ocean , 20 American sailors watched their ship flood with seawater .
They &apos;d been struck by a sperm whale , which had ripped a catastrophic hole in the ship &apos;s hull .
As their ship began to sink beneath the swells , the men huddled together in three small whaleboats .
These men were 10,000 miles from home , more than 1,000 miles from the nearest scrap of land .
In their small boats , they carried only rudimentary navigational equipment and limited supplies of food and water .
These were the men of the whaleship Essex , whose story would later inspire parts of &quot; Moby Dick . &quot;
Even in today &apos;s world , their situation would be really dire , but think about how much worse it would have been then .
No one on land had any idea that anything had gone wrong .
No search party was coming to look for these men .
So most of us have never experienced a situation as frightening as the one in which these sailors found themselves , but we all know what it &apos;s like to be afraid .
We know how fear feels , but I &apos;m not sure we spend enough time thinking about what our fears mean .
As we grow up , we &apos;re often encouraged to think of fear as a weakness , just another childish thing to discard like baby teeth or roller skates .
And I think it &apos;s no accident that we think this way .
Neuroscientists have actually shown that human beings are hard-wired to be optimists .
So maybe that &apos;s why we think of fear , sometimes , as a danger in and of itself .
&quot; Don &apos;t worry , &quot; we like to say to one another . &quot; Don &apos;t panic . &quot;
In English , fear is something we conquer .
It &apos;s something we fight . It &apos;s something we overcome .
But what if we looked at fear in a fresh way ?
What if we thought of fear as an amazing act of the imagination , something that can be as profound and insightful as storytelling itself ?
It &apos;s easiest to see this link between fear and the imagination in young children , whose fears are often extraordinarily vivid .
When I was a child , I lived in California , which is , you know , mostly a very nice place to live , but for me as a child , California could also be a little scary .
I remember how frightening it was to see the chandelier that hung above our dining table swing back and forth during every minor earthquake , and I sometimes couldn &apos;t sleep at night , terrified that the Big One might strike while we were sleeping .
And what we say about kids who have fears like that is that they have a vivid imagination .
But at a certain point , most of us learn to leave these kinds of visions behind and grow up .
We learn that there are no monsters hiding under the bed , and not every earthquake brings buildings down .
But maybe it &apos;s no coincidence that some of our most creative minds fail to leave these kinds of fears behind as adults .
The same incredible imaginations that produced &quot; The Origin of Species , &quot; &quot; Jane Eyre &quot; and &quot; The Remembrance of Things Past , &quot; also generated intense worries that haunted the adult lives of Charles Darwin , Charlotte BrontĂŤ and Marcel Proust .
So the question is , what can the rest of us learn about fear from visionaries and young children ?
Well let &apos;s return to the year 1819 for a moment , to the situation facing the crew of the whaleship Essex .
Let &apos;s take a look at the fears that their imaginations were generating as they drifted in the middle of the Pacific .
Twenty-four hours had now passed since the capsizing of the ship .
The time had come for the men to make a plan , but they had very few options .
In his fascinating account of the disaster , Nathaniel Philbrick wrote that these men were just about as far from land as it was possible to be anywhere on Earth .
The men knew that the nearest islands they could reach were the Marquesas Islands , 1,200 miles away .
But they &apos;d heard some frightening rumors .
They &apos;d been told that these islands , and several others nearby , were populated by cannibals .
So the men pictured coming ashore only to be murdered and eaten for dinner .
Another possible destination was Hawaii , but given the season , the captain was afraid they &apos;d be struck by severe storms .
Now the last option was the longest , and the most difficult : to sail 1,500 miles due south in hopes of reaching a certain band of winds that could eventually push them toward the coast of South America .
But they knew that the sheer length of this journey would stretch their supplies of food and water .
To be eaten by cannibals , to be battered by storms , to starve to death before reaching land .
These were the fears that danced in the imaginations of these poor men , and as it turned out , the fear they chose to listen to would govern whether they lived or died .
Now we might just as easily call these fears by a different name .
What if instead of calling them fears , we called them stories ?
Because that &apos;s really what fear is , if you think about it .
It &apos;s a kind of unintentional storytelling that we are all born knowing how to do .
And fears and storytelling have the same components .
They have the same architecture .
Like all stories , fears have characters .
In our fears , the characters are us .
Fears also have plots . They have beginnings and middles and ends .
You board the plane . The plane takes off . The engine fails .
Our fears also tend to contain imagery that can be every bit as vivid as what you might find in the pages of a novel .
Picture a cannibal , human teeth sinking into human skin , human flesh roasting over a fire .
Fears also have suspense .
If I &apos;ve done my job as a storyteller today , you should be wondering what happened to the men of the whaleship Essex .
Our fears provoke in us a very similar form of suspense .
Just like all great stories , our fears focus our attention on a question that is as important in life as it is in literature : What will happen next ?
In other words , our fears make us think about the future .
And humans , by the way , are the only creatures capable of thinking about the future in this way , of projecting ourselves forward in time , and this mental time travel is just one more thing that fears have in common with storytelling .
As a writer , I can tell you that a big part of writing fiction is learning to predict how one event in a story will affect all the other events , and fear works in that same way .
In fear , just like in fiction , one thing always leads to another .
When I was writing my first novel , &quot; The Age Of Miracles , &quot; I spent months trying to figure out what would happen if the rotation of the Earth suddenly began to slow down .
What would happen to our days ? What would happen to our crops ?
What would happen to our minds ?
And then it was only later that I realized how very similar these questions were to the ones I used to ask myself as a child frightened in the night .
If an earthquake strikes tonight , I used to worry , what will happen to our house ? What will happen to my family ?
And the answer to those questions always took the form of a story .
So if we think of our fears as more than just fears but as stories , we should think of ourselves as the authors of those stories .
But just as importantly , we need to think of ourselves as the readers of our fears , and how we choose to read our fears can have a profound effect on our lives .
Now , some of us naturally read our fears more closely than others .
I read about a study recently of successful entrepreneurs , and the author found that these people shared a habit that he called &quot; productive paranoia , &quot; which meant that these people , instead of dismissing their fears , these people read them closely , they studied them , and then they translated that fear into preparation and action .
So that way , if their worst fears came true , their businesses were ready .
And sometimes , of course , our worst fears do come true .
That &apos;s one of the things that is so extraordinary about fear .
Once in a while , our fears can predict the future .
But we can &apos;t possibly prepare for all of the fears that our imaginations concoct .
So how can we tell the difference between the fears worth listening to and all the others ?
I think the end of the story of the whaleship Essex offers an illuminating , if tragic , example .
After much deliberation , the men finally made a decision .
Terrified of cannibals , they decided to forgo the closest islands and instead embarked on the longer and much more difficult route to South America .
After more than two months at sea , the men ran out of food as they knew they might , and they were still quite far from land .
When the last of the survivors were finally picked up by two passing ships , less than half of the men were left alive , and some of them had resorted to their own form of cannibalism .
Herman Melville , who used this story as research for &quot; Moby Dick , &quot; wrote years later , and from dry land , quote , &quot; All the sufferings of these miserable men of the Essex might in all human probability have been avoided had they , immediately after leaving the wreck , steered straight for Tahiti .
But , &quot; as Melville put it , &quot; they dreaded cannibals . &quot;
So the question is , why did these men dread cannibals so much more than the extreme likelihood of starvation ?
Why were they swayed by one story so much more than the other ?
Looked at from this angle , theirs becomes a story about reading .
The novelist Vladimir Nabokov said that the best reader has a combination of two very different temperaments , the artistic and the scientific .
A good reader has an artist &apos;s passion , a willingness to get caught up in the story , but just as importantly , the readers also needs the coolness of judgment of a scientist , which acts to temper and complicate the reader &apos;s intuitive reactions to the story .
As we &apos;ve seen , the men of the Essex had no trouble with the artistic part .
They dreamed up a variety of horrifying scenarios .
The problem was that they listened to the wrong story .
Of all the narratives their fears wrote , they responded only to the most lurid , the most vivid , the one that was easiest for their imaginations to picture : cannibals .
But perhaps if they &apos;d been able to read their fears more like a scientist , with more coolness of judgment , they would have listened instead to the less violent but the more likely tale , the story of starvation , and headed for Tahiti , just as Melville &apos;s sad commentary suggests .
And maybe if we all tried to read our fears , we too would be less often swayed by the most salacious among them .
Maybe then we &apos;d spend less time worrying about serial killers and plane crashes , and more time concerned with the subtler and slower disasters we face : the silent buildup of plaque in our arteries , the gradual changes in our climate .
Just as the most nuanced stories in literature are often the richest , so too might our subtlest fears be the truest .
Read in the right way , our fears are an amazing gift of the imagination , a kind of everyday clairvoyance , a way of glimpsing what might be the future when there &apos;s still time to influence how that future will play out .
Properly read , our fears can offer us something as precious as our favorite works of literature : a little wisdom , a bit of insight and a version of that most elusive thing -- the truth .
Thank you .

Janine di Giovanni : What I saw in the war
This is how war starts .
One day you &apos;re living your ordinary life , you &apos;re planning to go to a party , you &apos;re taking your children to school , you &apos;re making a dentist appointment .
The next thing , the telephones go out , the TVs go out , there &apos;s armed men on the street , there &apos;s roadblocks .
Your life as you know it goes into suspended animation .
It stops .
I &apos;m going to steal a story from a friend of mine , a Bosnian friend , about what happened to her , because I think it will illustrate for you exactly what it feels like .
She was walking to work one day in April , 1992 , in a miniskirt and high heels . She worked in a bank .
She was a young mother . She was someone who liked to party .
Great person .
And suddenly she sees a tank ambling down the main road of Sarajevo knocking everything out of its path .
She thinks she &apos;s dreaming , but she &apos;s not .
And she runs as any of us would have done and takes cover , and she hides behind a trash bin , in her high heels and her miniskirt .
And as she &apos;s hiding there , she &apos;s feeling ridiculous , but she &apos;s seeing this tank go by with soldiers and people all over the place and chaos and she thinks , &quot; I feel like Alice in Wonderland going down the rabbit hole , down , down , down into chaos , and my life will never be the same again . &quot;
A few weeks later , my friend was in a crowd of people pushing with her infant son in her arms to give him to a stranger on a bus , which was one of the last buses leaving Sarajevo to take children out so they could be safe .
And she remembers struggling with her mother to the front , crowds and crowds of people , &quot; Take my child ! Take my child ! &quot;
and passing her son to someone through a window .
And she didn &apos;t see him for years .
The siege went on for three and a half years , and it was a siege without water , without power , without electricity , without heat , without food , in the middle of Europe , in the middle of the 20th century .
I had the honor of being one of those reporters that lived through that siege , and I say I have the honor and the privilege of being there because it &apos;s taught me everything , not just about being a reporter , but about being a human being .
I learned about compassion .
I learned about ordinary people who could be heroes .
I learned about sharing . I learned about camaraderie .
Most of all , I learned about love .
Even in the midst of terrible destruction and death and chaos , I learned how ordinary people could help their neighbors , share food , raise their children , drag someone who &apos;s being sniped at from the middle of the road even though you yourself were endangering your life , helping people get into taxis who were injured to try to take them to hospitals .
I learned so much about myself .
Martha Gellhorn , who &apos;s one of my heroes , once said , &quot; You can only love one war . The rest is responsibility . &quot;
I went on to cover many , many , many wars after that , so many that I lost count , but there was nothing like Sarajevo .
Last April , I went back to a very strange -- what I called a deranged high school reunion .
What it was , was the 20th anniversary of the siege , the beginning of the siege of Sarajevo , and I don &apos;t like the word &quot; anniversary , &quot; because it sounds like a party , and this was not a party .
It was a very somber gathering of the reporters that worked there during the war , humanitarian aid workers , and of course the brave and courageous people of Sarajevo themselves .
And the thing that struck me the most , that broke my heart , was walking down the main street of Sarajevo , where my friend Aida saw the tank coming 20 years ago , and in that road were more than 12,000 red chairs , and every single one of them symbolized a person who had died during the siege , just in Sarajevo , not in all of Bosnia , and it stretched from one end of the city to a large part of it , and the saddest for me were the tiny little chairs for the children .
I now cover Syria , and I started reporting it because I believed that it needs to be done .
I believe a story there has to be told .
I see , again , a template of the war in Bosnia .
And when I first arrived in Damascus , I saw this strange moment where people didn &apos;t seem to believe that war was going to descend , and it was exactly the same in Bosnia and nearly every other country I &apos;ve seen where war comes .
People don &apos;t want to believe it &apos;s coming , so they don &apos;t leave , they don &apos;t leave before they can .
They don &apos;t get their money out .
They stay because you want to stay in your home .
And then war and chaos descend .
Rwanda is a place that haunts me a lot .
In 1994 , I briefly left Sarajevo to go report the genocide in Rwanda .
Between April and August , 1994 , one million people were slaughtered .
Now if those 12,000 chairs freaked me out with the sheer number , I want you just for a second to think of a million people .
And to give you some example , I remember standing and looking down a road as far as I could see , at least a mile , and there were bodies piled twice my height of the dead .
And that was just a small percentage of the dead .
And there were mothers holding their children who had been caught in their last death throes .
So we learn a lot from war , and I mention Rwanda because it is one place , like South Africa , where nearly 20 years on , there is healing .
Fifty-six percent of the parliamentarians are women , which is fantastic , and there &apos;s also within the national constitution now , you &apos;re actually not allowed to say Hutu or Tutsi .
You &apos;re not allowed to identify anyone by ethnicity , which is , of course , what started the slaughter in the first place .
And an aid worker friend of mine told me the most beautiful story , or I find it beautiful .
There was a group of children , mixed Hutus and Tutsis , and a group of women who were adopting them , and they lined up and one was just given to the next .
There was no kind of compensation for , you &apos;re a Tutsi , you &apos;re a Hutu , you might have killed my mother , you might have killed my father .
They were just brought together in this kind of reconciliation , and I find this remarkable .
So when people ask me how I continue to cover war , and why I continue to do it , this is why .
When I go back to Syria , next week in fact , what I see is incredibly heroic people , some of them fighting for democracy , for things we take for granted every single day .
And that &apos;s pretty much why I do it .
In 2004 , I had a little baby boy , and I call him my miracle child , because after seeing so much death and destruction and chaos and darkness in my life , this ray of hope was born .
And I called him Luca , which means &quot; The bringer of light , &quot; because he does bring light to my life .
But I &apos;m talking about him because when he was four months old , my foreign editor forced me to go back to Baghdad where I had been reporting all throughout the Saddam regime and during the fall of Baghdad and afterwards , and I remember getting on the plane in tears , crying to be separated from my son , and while I was there , a quite famous Iraqi politician who was a friend of mine said to me , &quot; What are you doing here ?
Why aren &apos;t you home with Luca ? &quot;
And I said , &quot; Well , I have to see . &quot; It was 2004 which was the beginning of the incredibly bloody time in Iraq , &quot; I have to see , I have to see what is happening here .
I have to report it . &quot;
And he said , &quot; Go home , because if you miss his first tooth , if you miss his first step , you &apos;ll never forgive yourself .
But there will always be another war . &quot;
And there , sadly , will always be wars .
And I am deluding myself if I think , as a journalist , as a reporter , as a writer , what I do can stop them . I can &apos;t .
I &apos;m not Kofi Annan . He can &apos;t stop a war .
He tried to negotiate Syria and couldn &apos;t do it .
I &apos;m not a U.N. conflict resolution person .
I &apos;m not even a humanitarian aid doctor , and I can &apos;t tell you the times of how helpless I &apos;ve felt to have people dying in front of me , and I couldn &apos;t save them .
All I am is a witness .
My role is to bring a voice to people who are voiceless .
A colleague of mine described it as to shine a light in the darkest corners of the world .
And that &apos;s what I try to do .
I &apos;m not always successful , and sometimes it &apos;s incredibly frustrating , because you feel like you &apos;re writing into a void , or you feel like no one cares .
Who cares about Syria ? Who cares about Bosnia ?
Who cares about the Congo , the Ivory Coast , Liberia , Sierra Leone , all of these strings of places that I will remember for the rest of my life ?
But my métier is to bear witness and that is the crux , the heart of the matter , for us reporters who do this .
And all I can really do is hope , not to policymakers or politicians , because as much as I &apos;d like to have faith that they read my words and do something , I don &apos;t delude myself .
But what I do hope is that if you remember anything I said or any of my stories tomorrow morning over breakfast , if you can remember the story of Sarajevo , or the story of Rwanda , then I &apos;ve done my job .
Thank you very much .

When is the last time you did absolutely nothing for 10 whole minutes ? Not texting , talking or even thinking ? Mindfulness expert Andy Puddicombe describes the transformative power of doing just that : Refreshing your mind for 10 minutes a day , simply by being mindful and experiencing the present moment .

Andy Puddicombe : All it takes is 10 mindful minutes
We live in an incredibly busy world .
The pace of life is often frantic , our minds are always busy , and we &apos;re always doing something .
So with that in mind , I &apos;d like you just to take a moment to think , when did you last take any time to do nothing ?
Just 10 minutes , undisturbed ?
And when I say nothing , I do mean nothing .
So that &apos;s no emailing , texting , no Internet , no TV , no chatting , no eating , no reading , not even sitting there reminiscing about the past or planning for the future .
Simply doing nothing .
I see a lot of very blank faces .
My thinking is , you probably have to go a long way back .
And this is an extraordinary thing , right ?
We &apos;re talking about our mind .
The mind , our most valuable and precious resource , through which we experience every single moment of our life , the mind that we rely upon to be happy , content , emotionally stable as individuals , and at the same time to be kind and thoughtful and considerate in our relationships with others .
This is the same mind that we depend upon to be focused , creative , spontaneous , and to perform at our very best in everything that we do .
And yet , we don &apos;t take any time out to look after it .
In fact , we spend more time looking after our cars , our clothes and our hair than we — okay , maybe not our hair , but you see where I &apos;m going .
The result , of course , is that we get stressed .
You know , the mind whizzes away like a washing machine going round and round , lots of difficult , confusing emotions , and we don &apos;t really know how to deal with that , and the sad fact is that we are so distracted that we &apos;re no longer present in the world in which we live .
We miss out on the things that are most important to us , and the crazy thing is that everybody just assumes , well , that &apos;s the way life is , so we &apos;ve just kind of got to get on with it .
That &apos;s really not how it has to be .
So I was about 11 when I went along to my first meditation class .
And trust me , it had all the stereotypes that you can imagine , the sitting cross-legged on the floor , the incense , the herbal tea , the vegetarians , the whole deal , but my mom was going and I was intrigued , so I went along with her .
I &apos;d also seen a few kung fu movies , and secretly I kind of thought I might be able to learn how to fly , but I was very young at the time .
Now as I was there , I guess , like a lot of people , I assumed that it was just an aspirin for the mind .
You get stressed , you do some meditation .
I hadn &apos;t really thought that it could be sort of preventative in nature , until I was about 20 , when a number of things happened in my life in quite quick succession , really serious things which just flipped my life upside down and all of a sudden I was inundated with thoughts , inundated with difficult emotions that I didn &apos;t know how to cope with .
Every time I sort of pushed one down , another one would just sort of pop back up again .
It was a really very stressful time .
I guess we all deal with stress in different ways .
Some people will bury themselves in work , grateful for the distraction .
Others will turn to their friends , their family , looking for support .
Some people hit the bottle , start taking medication .
My own way of dealing with it was to become a monk .
So I quit my degree , I headed off to the Himalayas , I became a monk , and I started studying meditation .
People often ask me what I learned from that time .
Well , obviously it changed things .
Let &apos;s face it , becoming a celibate monk is going to change a number of things .
But it was more than that .
It taught me -- it gave me a greater appreciation , an understanding for the present moment .
By that I mean not being lost in thought , not being distracted , not being overwhelmed by difficult emotions , but instead learning how to be in the here and now , how to be mindful , how to be present .
I think the present moment is so underrated .
It sounds so ordinary , and yet we spend so little time in the present moment that it &apos;s anything but ordinary .
There was a research paper that came out of Harvard , just recently , that said on average our minds are lost in thought almost 47 percent of the time .
Forty-seven percent .
At the same time , this sort of constant mind-wandering is also a direct cause of unhappiness .
Now we &apos;re not here for that long anyway , but to spend almost half of our life lost in thought and potentially quite unhappy , dunno , it just kind of seems tragic , actually , especially when there &apos;s something we can do about it , when there &apos;s a positive , practical , achievable , scientifically proven technique which allows our mind to be more healthy , to be more mindful and less distracted .
And the beauty of it is that even though it need only take about 10 minutes a day , it impacts our entire life .
But we need to know how to do it .
We need an exercise . We need a framework to learn how to be more mindful .
That &apos;s essentially what meditation is .
It &apos;s familiarizing ourselves with the present moment .
But we also need to know how to approach it in the right way to get the best from it .
And that &apos;s what these are for , in case you &apos;ve been wondering , because most people assume that meditation is all about stopping thoughts , getting rid of emotions , somehow controlling the mind , but actually it &apos;s quite different from that .
It &apos;s more about stepping back , seeing the thought clearly , witnessing it coming and going , emotions coming and going without judgment , but with a relaxed , focused mind .
So for example , right now , if I focus too much on the balls , then there &apos;s no way that I can relax and talk to you at the same time .
Equally , if I relax too much talking to you , then there &apos;s no way I can focus on the balls . I &apos;m going to drop them .
Now in life , and in meditation , there &apos;ll be times when the focus becomes a little bit too intense , and life starts to feel a bit like this .
It &apos;s a very uncomfortable way to live life , when you get this tight and stressed .
At other times , we might take our foot off the gas a little bit too much , and things just become a sort of little bit like this .
Of course in meditation — — we &apos;re going to end up falling asleep .
So we &apos;re looking for a balance , a focused relaxation where we can allow thoughts to come and go without all the usual involvement .
Now , what usually happens when we &apos;re learning to be mindful is that we get distracted by a thought .
Let &apos;s say this is an anxious thought .
So everything &apos;s going fine , and then we see the anxious thought , and it &apos;s like , &quot; Oh , didn &apos;t realize I was worried about that . &quot;
You go back to it , repeat it . &quot; Oh , I am worried .
Oh , I really am worried . Wow , there &apos;s so much anxiety . &quot;
And before we know it , right , we &apos;re anxious about feeling anxious .
You know , this is crazy . We do this all the time , even on an everyday level .
If you think about the last time , I dunno , you had a wobbly tooth .
You know it &apos;s wobbly , and you know that it hurts .
But what do you do every 20 , 30 seconds ?
It does hurt . And we reinforce the storyline , right ?
And we just keep telling ourselves , and we do it all the time . And it &apos;s only in learning to watch the mind in this way that we can start to let go of those storylines and patterns of mind .
But when you sit down and you watch the mind in this way , you might see many different patterns .
You might find a mind that &apos;s really restless and -- the whole time .
Don &apos;t be surprised if you feel a bit agitated in your body when you sit down to do nothing and your mind feels like that .
You might find a mind that &apos;s very dull and boring , and it &apos;s just , almost mechanical , it just seems it &apos;s as if you &apos;re getting up , going to work , eat , sleep , get up , work .
Or it might just be that one little nagging thought that just goes round and round and round your mind .
Well , whatever it is , meditation offers the opportunity , the potential to step back and to get a different perspective , to see that things aren &apos;t always as they appear .
We can &apos;t change every little thing that happens to us in life , but we can change the way that we experience it .
That &apos;s the potential of meditation , of mindfulness .
You don &apos;t have to burn any incense , and you definitely don &apos;t have to sit on the floor .
All you need to do is to take 10 minutes out a day to step back , to familiarize yourself with the present moment so that you get to experience a greater sense of focus , calm and clarity in your life .
Thank you very much .

Clinical psychologist Meg Jay has a bold message for twentysomethings : Contrary to popular belief , your 20s are not a throwaway decade . In this provocative talk , Jay says that just because marriage , work and kids are happening later in life , doesn &apos;t mean you can &apos;t start planning now . She gives 3 pieces of advice for how twentysomethings can re-claim adulthood in the defining decade of their lives .

Meg Jay : Why 30 is not the new 20
When I was in my 20s , I saw my very first psychotherapy client .
I was a Ph.D. student in clinical psychology at Berkeley .
She was a 26-year-old woman named Alex .
Now Alex walked into her first session wearing jeans and a big slouchy top , and she dropped onto the couch in my office and kicked off her flats and told me she was there to talk about guy problems .
Now when I heard this , I was so relieved .
My classmate got an arsonist for her first client .
And I got a twentysomething who wanted to talk about boys .
This I thought I could handle .
But I didn &apos;t handle it .
With the funny stories that Alex would bring to session , it was easy for me just to nod my head while we kicked the can down the road .
&quot; Thirty &apos;s the new 20 , &quot; Alex would say , and as far as I could tell , she was right .
Work happened later , marriage happened later , kids happened later , even death happened later .
Twentysomethings like Alex and I had nothing but time .
But before long , my supervisor pushed me to push Alex about her love life .
I pushed back .
I said , &quot; Sure , she &apos;s dating down , she &apos;s sleeping with a knucklehead , but it &apos;s not like she &apos;s going to marry the guy . &quot;
And then my supervisor said , &quot; Not yet , but she might marry the next one .
Besides , the best time to work on Alex &apos;s marriage is before she has one . &quot;
That &apos;s what psychologists call an &quot; Aha ! &quot; moment .
That was the moment I realized , 30 is not the new 20 .
Yes , people settle down later than they used to , but that didn &apos;t make Alex &apos;s 20s a developmental downtime .
That made Alex &apos;s 20s a developmental sweet spot , and we were sitting there blowing it .
That was when I realized that this sort of benign neglect was a real problem , and it had real consequences , not just for Alex and her love life but for the careers and the families and the futures of twentysomethings everywhere .
There are 50 million twentysomethings in the United States right now .
We &apos;re talking about 15 percent of the population , or 100 percent if you consider that no one &apos;s getting through adulthood without going through their 20s first .
Raise your hand if you &apos;re in your 20s .
I really want to see some twentysomethings here .
Oh , yay ! Y &apos;all &apos;s awesome .
If you work with twentysomethings , you love a twentysomething , you &apos;re losing sleep over twentysomethings , I want to see — Okay . Awesome , twentysomethings really matter .
So I specialize in twentysomethings because I believe that every single one of those 50 million twentysomethings deserves to know what psychologists , sociologists , neurologists and fertility specialists already know : that claiming your 20s is one of the simplest , yet most transformative , things you can do for work , for love , for your happiness , maybe even for the world .
This is not my opinion . These are the facts .
We know that 80 percent of life &apos;s most defining moments take place by age 35 .
That means that eight out of 10 of the decisions and experiences and &quot; Aha ! &quot; moments that make your life what it is will have happened by your mid-30s .
People who are over 40 , don &apos;t panic .
This crowd is going to be fine , I think .
We know that the first 10 years of a career has an exponential impact on how much money you &apos;re going to earn .
We know that more than half of Americans are married or are living with or dating their future partner by 30 .
We know that the brain caps off its second and last growth spurt in your 20s as it rewires itself for adulthood , which means that whatever it is you want to change about yourself , now is the time to change it .
We know that personality changes more during your 20s than at any other time in life , and we know that female fertility peaks at age 28 , and things get tricky after age 35 .
So your 20s are the time to educate yourself about your body and your options .
So when we think about child development , we all know that the first five years are a critical period for language and attachment in the brain .
It &apos;s a time when your ordinary , day-to-day life has an inordinate impact on who you will become .
But what we hear less about is that there &apos;s such a thing as adult development , and our 20s are that critical period of adult development .
But this isn &apos;t what twentysomethings are hearing .
Newspapers talk about the changing timetable of adulthood .
Researchers call the 20s an extended adolescence .
Journalists coin silly nicknames for twentysomethings like &quot; twixters &quot; and &quot; kidults . &quot;
It &apos;s true .
As a culture , we have trivialized what is actually the defining decade of adulthood .
Leonard Bernstein said that to achieve great things , you need a plan and not quite enough time .
Isn &apos;t that true ?
So what do you think happens when you pat a twentysomething on the head and you say , &quot; You have 10 extra years to start your life &quot; ?
Nothing happens .
You have robbed that person of his urgency and ambition , and absolutely nothing happens .
And then every day , smart , interesting twentysomethings like you or like your sons and daughters come into my office and say things like this : &quot; I know my boyfriend &apos;s no good for me , but this relationship doesn &apos;t count . I &apos;m just killing time . &quot;
Or they say , &quot; Everybody says as long as I get started on a career by the time I &apos;m 30 , I &apos;ll be fine . &quot;
But then it starts to sound like this : &quot; My 20s are almost over , and I have nothing to show for myself .
I had a better résumé the day after I graduated from college . &quot;
And then it starts to sound like this : &quot; Dating in my 20s was like musical chairs .
Everybody was running around and having fun , but then sometime around 30 it was like the music turned off and everybody started sitting down .
I didn &apos;t want to be the only one left standing up , so sometimes I think I married my husband because he was the closest chair to me at 30 . &quot;
Where are the twentysomethings here ?
Do not do that .
Okay , now that sounds a little flip , but make no mistake , the stakes are very high .
When a lot has been pushed to your 30s , there is enormous thirtysomething pressure to jump-start a career , pick a city , partner up , and have two or three kids in a much shorter period of time .
Many of these things are incompatible , and as research is just starting to show , simply harder and more stressful to do all at once in our 30s .
The post-millennial midlife crisis isn &apos;t buying a red sports car .
It &apos;s realizing you can &apos;t have that career you now want .
It &apos;s realizing you can &apos;t have that child you now want , or you can &apos;t give your child a sibling .
Too many thirtysomethings and fortysomethings look at themselves , and at me , sitting across the room , and say about their 20s , &quot; What was I doing ? What was I thinking ? &quot;
I want to change what twentysomethings are doing and thinking .
Here &apos;s a story about how that can go .
It &apos;s a story about a woman named Emma .
At 25 , Emma came to my office because she was , in her words , having an identity crisis .
She said she thought she might like to work in art or entertainment , but she hadn &apos;t decided yet , so she &apos;d spent the last few years waiting tables instead .
Because it was cheaper , she lived with a boyfriend who displayed his temper more than his ambition .
And as hard as her 20s were , her early life had been even harder .
She often cried in our sessions , but then would collect herself by saying , &quot; You can &apos;t pick your family , but you can pick your friends . &quot;
Well one day , Emma comes in and she hangs her head in her lap , and she sobbed for most of the hour .
She &apos;d just bought a new address book , and she &apos;d spent the morning filling in her many contacts , but then she &apos;d been left staring at that empty blank that comes after the words &quot; In case of emergency , please call ... . &quot;
She was nearly hysterical when she looked at me and said , &quot; Who &apos;s going to be there for me if I get in a car wreck ?
Who &apos;s going to take care of me if I have cancer ? &quot;
Now in that moment , it took everything I had not to say , &quot; I will . &quot;
But what Emma needed wasn &apos;t some therapist who really , really cared .
Emma needed a better life , and I knew this was her chance .
I had learned too much since I first worked with Alex to just sit there while Emma &apos;s defining decade went parading by .
So over the next weeks and months , I told Emma three things that every twentysomething , male or female , deserves to hear .
First , I told Emma to forget about having an identity crisis and get some identity capital .
By get identity capital , I mean do something that adds value to who you are .
Do something that &apos;s an investment in who you might want to be next .
I didn &apos;t know the future of Emma &apos;s career , and no one knows the future of work , but I do know this : Identity capital begets identity capital .
So now is the time for that cross-country job , that internship , that startup you want to try .
I &apos;m not discounting twentysomething exploration here , but I am discounting exploration that &apos;s not supposed to count , which , by the way , is not exploration .
That &apos;s procrastination .
I told Emma to explore work and make it count .
Second , I told Emma that the urban tribe is overrated .
Best friends are great for giving rides to the airport , but twentysomethings who huddle together with like-minded peers limit who they know , what they know , how they think , how they speak , and where they work .
That new piece of capital , that new person to date almost always comes from outside the inner circle .
New things come from what are called our weak ties , our friends of friends of friends .
So yes , half of twentysomethings are un- or under-employed .
But half aren &apos;t , and weak ties are how you get yourself into that group .
Half of new jobs are never posted , so reaching out to your neighbor &apos;s boss is how you get that un-posted job .
It &apos;s not cheating . It &apos;s the science of how information spreads .
Last but not least , Emma believed that you can &apos;t pick your family , but you can pick your friends .
Now this was true for her growing up , but as a twentysomething , soon Emma would pick her family when she partnered with someone and created a family of her own .
I told Emma the time to start picking your family is now .
Now you may be thinking that 30 is actually a better time to settle down than 20 , or even 25 , and I agree with you .
But grabbing whoever you &apos;re living with or sleeping with when everyone on Facebook starts walking down the aisle is not progress .
The best time to work on your marriage is before you have one , and that means being as intentional with love as you are with work .
Picking your family is about consciously choosing who and what you want rather than just making it work or killing time with whoever happens to be choosing you .
So what happened to Emma ?
Well , we went through that address book , and she found an old roommate &apos;s cousin who worked at an art museum in another state .
That weak tie helped her get a job there .
That job offer gave her the reason to leave that live-in boyfriend .
Now , five years later , she &apos;s a special events planner for museums .
She &apos;s married to a man she mindfully chose .
She loves her new career , she loves her new family , and she sent me a card that said , &quot; Now the emergency contact blanks don &apos;t seem big enough . &quot;
Now Emma &apos;s story made that sound easy , but that &apos;s what I love about working with twentysomethings .
They are so easy to help .
Twentysomethings are like airplanes just leaving LAX , bound for somewhere west .
Right after takeoff , a slight change in course is the difference between landing in Alaska or Fiji .
Likewise , at 21 or 25 or even 29 , one good conversation , one good break , one good TED Talk , can have an enormous effect across years and even generations to come .
So here &apos;s an idea worth spreading to every twentysomething you know .
It &apos;s as simple as what I learned to say to Alex .
It &apos;s what I now have the privilege of saying to twentysomethings like Emma every single day : Thirty is not the new 20 , so claim your adulthood , get some identity capital , use your weak ties , pick your family .
Don &apos;t be defined by what you didn &apos;t know or didn &apos;t do .
You &apos;re deciding your life right now .
Thank you .

The border between our physical world and the digital information surrounding us has been getting thinner and thinner . Designer and engineer Jinha Lee wants to dissolve it altogether . As he demonstrates in this short , gasp-inducing talk , his ideas include a pen that penetrates into a screen to draw 3D models and SpaceTop , a computer desktop prototype that lets you reach through the screen to manipulate digital objects .

Jinha Lee : Reach into the computer and grab a pixel
Throughout the history of computers we &apos;ve been striving to shorten the gap between us and digital information , the gap between our physical world and the world in the screen where our imagination can go wild .
And this gap has become shorter , shorter , and even shorter , and now this gap is shortened down to less than a millimeter , the thickness of a touch-screen glass , and the power of computing has become accessible to everyone .
But I wondered , what if there could be no boundary at all ?
I started to imagine what this would look like .
First , I created this tool which penetrates into the digital space , so when you press it hard on the screen , it transfers its physical body into pixels .
Designers can materialize their ideas directly in 3D , and surgeons can practice on virtual organs underneath the screen .
So with this tool , this boundary has been broken .
But our two hands still remain outside the screen .
How can you reach inside and interact with the digital information using the full dexterity of our hands ?
At Microsoft Applied Sciences , along with my mentor Cati Boulanger , I redesigned the computer and turned a little space above the keyboard into a digital workspace .
By combining a transparent display and depth cameras for sensing your fingers and face , now you can lift up your hands from the keyboard and reach inside this 3D space and grab pixels with your bare hands .
Because windows and files have a position in the real space , selecting them is as easy as grabbing a book off your shelf .
Then you can flip through this book while highlighting the lines , words on the virtual touch pad below each floating window .
Architects can stretch or rotate the models with their two hands directly .
So in these examples , we are reaching into the digital world .
But how about reversing its role and having the digital information reach us instead ?
I &apos;m sure many of us have had the experience of buying and returning items online .
But now you don &apos;t have to worry about it .
What I got here is an online augmented fitting room .
This is a view that you get from head-mounted or see-through display when the system understands the geometry of your body .
Taking this idea further , I started to think , instead of just seeing these pixels in our space , how can we make it physical so that we can touch and feel it ?
What would such a future look like ?
At MIT Media Lab , along with my advisor Hiroshi Ishii and my collaborator Rehmi Post , we created this one physical pixel .
Well , in this case , this spherical magnet acts like a 3D pixel in our space , which means that both computers and people can move this object to anywhere within this little 3D space .
What we did was essentially canceling gravity and controlling the movement by combining magnetic levitation and mechanical actuation and sensing technologies .
And by digitally programming the object , we are liberating the object from constraints of time and space , which means that now , human motions can be recorded and played back and left permanently in the physical world .
So choreography can be taught physically over distance and Michael Jordan &apos;s famous shooting can be replicated over and over as a physical reality .
Students can use this as a tool to learn about the complex concepts such as planetary motion , physics , and unlike computer screens or textbooks , this is a real , tangible experience that you can touch and feel , and it &apos;s very powerful .
And what &apos;s more exciting than just turning what &apos;s currently in the computer physical is to start imagining how programming the world will alter even our daily physical activities .
As you can see , the digital information will not just show us something but it will start directly acting upon us as a part of our physical surroundings without disconnecting ourselves from our world .
Today , we started by talking about the boundary , but if we remove this boundary , the only boundary left is our imagination .
Thank you .

What happens when a dream you &apos;ve held since childhood … doesn &apos;t come true ? As Lisa Bu adjusted to a new life in the United States , she turned to books to expand her mind and create a new path for herself . She shares her unique approach to reading in this lovely , personal talk about the magic of books .

Lisa Bu : How books can open your mind
So I was trained to become a gymnast for two years in Hunan , China in the 1970s .
When I was in the first grade , the government wanted to transfer me to a school for athletes , all expenses paid .
But my tiger mother said , &quot; No . &quot;
My parents wanted me to become an engineer like them .
After surviving the Cultural Revolution , they firmly believed there &apos;s only one sure way to happiness : a safe and well-paid job .
It is not important if I like the job or not .
But my dream was to become a Chinese opera singer .
That is me playing my imaginary piano .
An opera singer must start training young to learn acrobatics , so I tried everything I could to go to opera school .
I even wrote to the school principal and the host of a radio show .
But no adults liked the idea .
No adults believed I was serious .
Only my friends supported me , but they were kids , just as powerless as I was .
So at age 15 , I knew I was too old to be trained .
My dream would never come true .
I was afraid that for the rest of my life some second-class happiness would be the best I could hope for .
But that &apos;s so unfair .
So I was determined to find another calling .
Nobody around to teach me ? Fine .
I turned to books .
I satisfied my hunger for parental advice from this book by a family of writers and musicians . &#91; &quot; Correspondence in the Family of Fou Lei &quot; &#93; I found my role model of an independent woman when Confucian tradition requires obedience . &#91; &quot; Jane Eyre &quot; &#93; And I learned to be efficient from this book . &#91; &quot; Cheaper by the Dozen &quot; &#93; And I was inspired to study abroad after reading these .
&#91; &quot; Complete Works of Sanmao &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; Lessons From History &quot; by Nan Huaijin &#93; I came to the U.S. in 1995 , so which books did I read here first ?
Books banned in China , of course .
&quot; The Good Earth &quot; is about Chinese peasant life .
That &apos;s just not convenient for propaganda . Got it .
The Bible is interesting , but strange .
That &apos;s a topic for a different day .
But the fifth commandment gave me an epiphany : &quot; You shall honor your father and mother . &quot;
&quot; Honor , &quot; I said . &quot; That &apos;s so different , and better , than obey . &quot;
So it becomes my tool to climb out of this Confucian guilt trap and to restart my relationship with my parents .
Encountering a new culture also started my habit of comparative reading .
It offers many insights .
For example , I found this map out of place at first because this is what Chinese students grew up with .
It had never occurred to me , China doesn &apos;t have to be at the center of the world .
A map actually carries somebody &apos;s view .
Comparative reading actually is nothing new .
It &apos;s a standard practice in the academic world .
There are even research fields such as comparative religion and comparative literature .
Compare and contrast gives scholars a more complete understanding of a topic .
So I thought , well , if comparative reading works for research , why not do it in daily life too ?
So I started reading books in pairs .
So they can be about people -- &#91; &quot; Benjamin Franklin &quot; by Walter Isaacson &#93; &#91; &quot; John Adams &quot; by David McCullough &#93; -- who are involved in the same event , or friends with shared experiences .
&#91; &quot; Personal History &quot; by Katharine Graham &#93; &#91; &quot; The Snowball : Warren Buffett and the Business of Life , &quot; by Alice Schroeder &#93; I also compare the same stories in different genres -- &#91; Holy Bible : King James Version &#93; &#91; &quot; Lamb &quot; by Chrisopher Moore &#93; -- or similar stories from different cultures , as Joseph Campbell did in his wonderful book . &#91; &quot; The Power of Myth &quot; by Joseph Campbell &#93; For example , both the Christ and the Buddha went through three temptations .
For the Christ , the temptations are economic , political and spiritual .
For the Buddha , they are all psychological : lust , fear and social duty -- interesting .
So if you know a foreign language , it &apos;s also fun to read your favorite books in two languages .
&#91; &quot; The Way of Chuang Tzu &quot; Thomas Merton &#93; &#91; &quot; Tao : The Watercourse Way &quot; Alan Watts &#93; Instead of lost in translation , I found there is much to gain .
For example , it &apos;s through translation that I realized &quot; happiness &quot; in Chinese literally means &quot; fast joy . &quot; Huh !
&quot; Bride &quot; in Chinese literally means &quot; new mother . &quot; Uh-oh .
Books have given me a magic portal to connect with people of the past and the present .
I know I shall never feel lonely or powerless again .
Having a dream shattered really is nothing compared to what many others have suffered .
I have come to believe that coming true is not the only purpose of a dream .
Its most important purpose is to get us in touch with where dreams come from , where passion comes from , where happiness comes from .
Even a shattered dream can do that for you .
So because of books , I &apos;m here today , happy , living again with a purpose and a clarity , most of the time .
So may books be always with you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .


http : / / www.ted.com / talks / parul _ sehgal _ an _ ode _ to _ envy.html
What is jealousy ? What drives it , and why do we secretly love it ? No study has ever been able to capture its &quot; loneliness , longevity , grim thrill &quot; -- that is , says Parul Sehgal , except for fiction . In an eloquent meditation she scours pages from literature to show how jealousy is not so different from a quest for knowledge .

Parul Sehgal : An ode to envy
So when I was eight years old , a new girl came to join the class , and she was so impressive , as the new girl always seems to be .
She had vast quantities of very shiny hair and a cute little pencil case , super strong on state capitals , just a great speller .
And I just curdled with jealousy that year , until I hatched my devious plan .
So one day I stayed a little late after school , a little too late , and I lurked in the girls &apos; bathroom .
When the coast was clear , I emerged , crept into the classroom , and took from my teacher &apos;s desk the grade book .
And then I did it .
I fiddled with my rival &apos;s grades , just a little , just demoted some of those A &apos;s .
All of those A &apos;s .
And I got ready to return the book to the drawer , when hang on , some of my other classmates had appallingly good grades too .
So , in a frenzy , I corrected everybody &apos;s marks , not imaginatively .
I gave everybody a row of D &apos;s and I gave myself a row of A &apos;s , just because I was there , you know , might as well .
And I am still baffled by my behavior .
I don &apos;t understand where the idea came from .
I don &apos;t understand why I felt so great doing it .
I felt great .
I don &apos;t understand why I was never caught .
I mean , it should have been so blatantly obvious .
I was never caught .
But most of all , I am baffled by , why did it bother me so much that this little girl , this tiny little girl , was so good at spelling ?
Jealousy baffles me .
It &apos;s so mysterious , and it &apos;s so pervasive .
We know babies suffer from jealousy .
We know primates do . Bluebirds are actually very prone .
We know that jealousy is the number one cause of spousal murder in the United States .
And yet , I have never read a study that can parse to me its loneliness or its longevity or its grim thrill .
For that , we have to go to fiction , because the novel is the lab that has studied jealousy in every possible configuration .
In fact , I don &apos;t know if it &apos;s an exaggeration to say that if we didn &apos;t have jealousy , would we even have literature ?
Well no faithless Helen , no &quot; Odyssey . &quot;
No jealous king , no &quot; Arabian Nights . &quot;
No Shakespeare .
There goes high school reading lists , because we &apos;re losing &quot; Sound and the Fury , &quot; we &apos;re losing &quot; Gatsby , &quot; &quot; Sun Also Rises , &quot; we &apos;re losing &quot; Madame Bovary , &quot; &quot; Anna K. &quot;
No jealousy , no Proust . And now , I mean , I know it &apos;s fashionable to say that Proust has the answers to everything , but in the case of jealousy , he kind of does .
This year is the centennial of his masterpiece , &quot; In Search of Lost Time , &quot; and it &apos;s the most exhaustive study of sexual jealousy and just regular competitiveness , my brand , that we can hope to have .
And we think about Proust , we think about the sentimental bits , right ?
We think about a little boy trying to get to sleep .
We think about a madeleine moistened in lavender tea .
We forget how harsh his vision was .
We forget how pitiless he is .
I mean , these are books that Virginia Woolf said were tough as cat gut .
I don &apos;t know what cat gut is , but let &apos;s assume it &apos;s formidable .
Let &apos;s look at why they go so well together , the novel and jealousy , jealousy and Proust .
Is it something as obvious as that jealousy , which boils down into person , desire , impediment , is such a solid narrative foundation ?
I don &apos;t know . I think it cuts very close to the bone , because let &apos;s think about what happens when we feel jealous .
When we feel jealous , we tell ourselves a story .
We tell ourselves a story about other people &apos;s lives , and these stories make us feel terrible because they &apos;re designed to make us feel terrible .
As the teller of the tale and the audience , we know just what details to include , to dig that knife in . Right ?
Jealousy makes us all amateur novelists , and this is something Proust understood .
In the first volume , Swann &apos;s Way , the series of books , Swann , one of the main characters , is thinking very fondly of his mistress and how great she is in bed , and suddenly , in the course of a few sentences , and these are Proustian sentences , so they &apos;re long as rivers , but in the course of a few sentences , he suddenly recoils and he realizes , &quot; Hang on , everything I love about this woman , somebody else would love about this woman .
Everything that she does that gives me pleasure could be giving somebody else pleasure , maybe right about now . &quot;
And this is the story he starts to tell himself , and from then on , Proust writes that every fresh charm Swann detects in his mistress , he adds to his &quot; collection of instruments in his private torture chamber . &quot;
Now Swann and Proust , we have to admit , were notoriously jealous .
You know , Proust &apos;s boyfriends would have to leave the country if they wanted to break up with him .
But you don &apos;t have to be that jealous to concede that it &apos;s hard work . Right ?
Jealousy is exhausting .
It &apos;s a hungry emotion . It must be fed .
And what does jealousy like ?
Jealousy likes information .
Jealousy likes details .
Jealousy likes the vast quantities of shiny hair , the cute little pencil case .
Jealousy likes photos .
That &apos;s why Instagram is such a hit .
Proust actually links the language of scholarship and jealousy .
When Swann is in his jealous throes , and suddenly he &apos;s listening at doorways and bribing his mistress &apos; servants , he defends these behaviors .
He says , &quot; You know , look , I know you think this is repugnant , but it is no different from interpreting an ancient text or looking at a monument . &quot;
He says , &quot; They are scientific investigations with real intellectual value . &quot;
Proust is trying to show us that jealousy feels intolerable and makes us look absurd , but it is , at its crux , a quest for knowledge , a quest for truth , painful truth , and actually , where Proust is concerned , the more painful the truth , the better .
Grief , humiliation , loss : These were the avenues to wisdom for Proust .
He says , &quot; A woman whom we need , who makes us suffer , elicits from us a gamut of feelings far more profound and vital than a man of genius who interests us . &quot;
Is he telling us to just go and find cruel women ?
No . I think he &apos;s trying to say that jealousy reveals us to ourselves .
And does any other emotion crack us open in this particular way ?
Does any other emotion reveal to us our aggression and our hideous ambition and our entitlement ?
Does any other emotion teach us to look with such peculiar intensity ?
Freud would write about this later .
One day , Freud was visited by this very anxious young man who was consumed with the thought of his wife cheating on him .
And Freud says , it &apos;s something strange about this guy , because he &apos;s not looking at what his wife is doing .
Because she &apos;s blameless ; everybody knows it .
The poor creature is just under suspicion for no cause .
But he &apos;s looking for things that his wife is doing without noticing , unintentional behaviors .
Is she smiling too brightly here , or did she accidentally brush up against a man there ?
&#91; Freud &#93; says that the man is becoming the custodian of his wife &apos;s unconscious .
The novel is very good on this point .
The novel is very good at describing how jealousy trains us to look with intensity but not accuracy .
In fact , the more intensely jealous we are , the more we become residents of fantasy .
And this is why , I think , jealousy doesn &apos;t just provoke us to do violent things or illegal things .
Jealousy prompts us to behave in ways that are wildly inventive .
Now I &apos;m thinking of myself at eight , I concede , but I &apos;m also thinking of this story I heard on the news .
A 52-year-old Michigan woman was caught creating a fake Facebook account from which she sent vile , hideous messages to herself for a year .
For a year . A year .
And she was trying to frame her ex-boyfriend &apos;s new girlfriend , and I have to confess when I heard this , I just reacted with admiration .
Because , I mean , let &apos;s be real .
What immense , if misplaced , creativity . Right ?
This is something from a novel .
This is something from a Patricia Highsmith novel .
Now Highsmith is a particular favorite of mine .
She is the very brilliant and bizarre woman of American letters .
She &apos;s the author of &quot; Strangers on a Train &quot; and &quot; The Talented Mr. Ripley , &quot; books that are all about how jealousy , it muddles our minds , and once we &apos;re in the sphere , in that realm of jealousy , the membrane between what is and what could be can be pierced in an instant .
Take Tom Ripley , her most famous character .
Now , Tom Ripley goes from wanting you or wanting what you have to being you and having what you once had , and you &apos;re under the floorboards , he &apos;s answering to your name , he &apos;s wearing your rings , emptying your bank account .
That &apos;s one way to go .
But what do we do ? We can &apos;t go the Tom Ripley route .
I can &apos;t give the world D &apos;s , as much as I would really like to , some days .
And it &apos;s a pity , because we live in envious times .
We live in jealous times .
I mean , we &apos;re all good citizens of social media , aren &apos;t we , where the currency is envy ?
Does the novel show us a way out ? I &apos;m not sure .
So let &apos;s do what characters always do when they &apos;re not sure , when they are in possession of a mystery .
Let &apos;s go to 221B Baker Street and ask for Sherlock Holmes .
When people think of Holmes , they think of his nemesis being Professor Moriarty , right , this criminal mastermind .
But I &apos;ve always preferred &#91; Inspector &#93; Lestrade , who is the rat-faced head of Scotland Yard who needs Holmes desperately , needs Holmes &apos; genius , but resents him .
Oh , it &apos;s so familiar to me .
So Lestrade needs his help , resents him , and sort of seethes with bitterness over the course of the mysteries .
But as they work together , something starts to change , and finally in &quot; The Adventure of the Six Napoleons , &quot; once Holmes comes in , dazzles everybody with his solution , Lestrade turns to Holmes and he says , &quot; We &apos;re not jealous of you , Mr. Holmes .
We &apos;re proud of you . &quot;
And he says that there &apos;s not a man at Scotland Yard who wouldn &apos;t want to shake Sherlock Holmes &apos; hand .
It &apos;s one of the few times we see Holmes moved in the mysteries , and I find it very moving , this little scene , but it &apos;s also mysterious , right ?
It seems to treat jealousy as a problem of geometry , not emotion .
You know , one minute Holmes is on the other side from Lestrade .
The next minute they &apos;re on the same side .
Suddenly , Lestrade is letting himself admire this mind that he &apos;s resented .
Could it be so simple though ?
What if jealousy really is a matter of geometry , just a matter of where we allow ourselves to stand in relation to another ?
Well , maybe then we wouldn &apos;t have to resent somebody &apos;s excellence .
We could align ourselves with it .
But I like contingency plans .
So while we wait for that to happen , let us remember that we have fiction for consolation .
Fiction alone demystifies jealousy .
Fiction alone domesticates it , invites it to the table .
And look who it gathers : sweet Lestrade , terrifying Tom Ripley , crazy Swann , Marcel Proust himself .
We are in excellent company .
Thank you .

Maysoon Zayid : I got 99 problems ... palsy is just one
Hello , TEDWomen , what &apos;s up .
Not good enough .
Hello , TEDWomen , what is up ?
My name is Maysoon Zayid , and I am not drunk , but the doctor who delivered me was .
He cut my mom six different times in six different directions , suffocating poor little me in the process .
As a result , I have cerebral palsy , which means I shake all the time .
Look .
It &apos;s exhausting . I &apos;m like Shakira , Shakira meets Muhammad Ali .
C.P. is not genetic .
It &apos;s not a birth defect . You can &apos;t catch it .
No one put a curse on my mother &apos;s uterus , and I didn &apos;t get it because my parents are first cousins , which they are .
It only happens from accidents , like what happened to me on my birth day .
Now , I must warn you , I &apos;m not inspirational , and I don &apos;t want anyone in this room to feel bad for me , because at some point in your life , you have dreamt of being disabled .
Come on a journey with me .
It &apos;s Christmas Eve , you &apos;re at the mall , you &apos;re driving around in circles looking for parking , and what do you see ?
Sixteen empty handicapped spaces .
And you &apos;re like , &quot; God , can &apos;t I just be a little disabled ? &quot;
Also , I gotta tell you , I got 99 problems , and palsy is just one .
If there was an Oppression Olympics , I would win the gold medal .
I &apos;m Palestinian , Muslim , I &apos;m female , I &apos;m disabled , and I live in New Jersey .
If you don &apos;t feel better about yourself , maybe you should .
Cliffside Park , New Jersey is my hometown .
I have always loved the fact that my hood and my affliction share the same initials .
I also love the fact that if I wanted to walk from my house to New York City , I could .
A lot of people with C.P. don &apos;t walk , but my parents didn &apos;t believe in &quot; can &apos;t . &quot;
My father &apos;s mantra was , &quot; You can do it , yes you can can . &quot;
So , if my three older sisters were mopping , I was mopping .
If my three older sisters went to public school , my parents would sue the school system and guarantee that I went too , and if we didn &apos;t all get A &apos;s , we all got my mother &apos;s slipper .
My father taught me how to walk when I was five years old by placing my heels on his feet and just walking .
Another tactic that he used is he would dangle a dollar bill in front of me and have me chase it .
My inner stripper was very strong , and by -- Yeah . No , by the first day of kindergarten , I was walking like a champ who had been punched one too many times .
Growing up , there were only six Arabs in my town , and they were all my family .
Now there are 20 Arabs in town , and they are still all my family .
I don &apos;t think anyone even noticed we weren &apos;t Italian .
This was before 9 / 11 and before politicians thought it was appropriate to use &quot; I hate Moslems &quot; as a campaign slogan .
The people that I grew up with had no problem with my faith .
They did , however , seem very concerned that I would starve to death during Ramadan .
I would explain to them that I have enough fat to live off of for three whole months , so fasting from sunrise to sunset is a piece of cake .
I have tap-danced on Broadway .
Yeah , on Broadway . It &apos;s crazy .
My parents couldn &apos;t afford physical therapy , so they sent me to dancing school .
I learned how to dance in heels , which means I can walk in heels .
And I &apos;m from Jersey , and we are really concerned with being chic , so if my friends wore heels , so did I.
And when my friends went and spent their summer vacations on the Jersey Shore , I did not .
I spent my summers in a war zone , because my parents were afraid that if we didn &apos;t go back to Palestine every single summer , we &apos;d grow up to be Madonna .
Summer vacations often consisted of my father trying to heal me , so I drank deer &apos;s milk , I had hot cups on my back , I was dunked in the Dead Sea , and I remember the water burning my eyes and thinking , &quot; It &apos;s working ! It &apos;s working ! &quot;
But one miracle cure we did find was yoga .
I have to tell you , it &apos;s very boring , but before I did yoga , I was a stand-up comedian who can &apos;t stand up .
And now I can stand on my head .
My parents reinforced this notion that I could do anything , that no dream was impossible , and my dream was to be on the daytime soap opera &quot; General Hospital . &quot;
I went to college during affirmative action and got a sweet scholarship to ASU , Arizona State University , because I fit every single quota .
I was like the pet lemur of the theater department .
Everybody loved me .
I did all the less-than-intelligent kids &apos; homework , I got A &apos;s in all of my classes , A &apos;s in all of their classes .
Every time I did a scene from &quot; The Glass Menagerie , &quot; my professors would weep .
But I never got cast .
Finally , my senior year , ASU decided to do a show called &quot; They Dance Real Slow in Jackson . &quot;
It &apos;s a play about a girl with C.P.
I was a girl with C.P.
So I start shouting from the rooftops , &quot; I &apos;m finally going to get a part !
I have cerebral palsy !
Free at last ! Free at last !
Thank God almighty , I &apos;m free at last ! &quot;
I didn &apos;t get the part .
Sherry Brown got the part .
I went racing to the head of the theater department crying hysterically , like someone shot my cat , to ask her why , and she said it was because they didn &apos;t think I could do the stunts .
I said , &quot; Excuse me , if I can &apos;t do the stunts , neither can the character . &quot;
This was a part that I was literally born to play and they gave it , they gave it to a non-palsy actress .
College was imitating life .
Hollywood has a sordid history of casting able-bodied actors to play disabled onscreen .
Upon graduating , I moved back home , and my first acting gig was as an extra on a daytime soap opera .
My dream was coming true .
And I knew that I would be promoted from &quot; diner diner &quot; to &quot; wacky best friend &quot; in no time .
But instead , I remained a glorified piece of furniture that you could only recognize from the back of my head , and it became clear to me that casting directors didn &apos;t hire fluffy , ethnic , disabled actors .
They only hired perfect people .
But there were exceptions to the rule .
I grew up watching Whoopi Goldberg , Roseanne Barr , Ellen , and all of these women had one thing in common : they were comedians .
So I became a comic .
My first gig was driving famous comics from New York City to shows in New Jersey , and I &apos;ll never forget the face of the first comic I ever drove when he realized that he was speeding down the New Jersey Turnpike with a chick with C.P. driving him .
I &apos;ve performed in clubs all over America , and I &apos;ve also performed in Arabic in the Middle East , uncensored and uncovered .
Some people say I &apos;m the first stand-up comic in the Arab world .
I never like to claim first , but I do know that they never heard that nasty little rumor that women aren &apos;t funny , and they find us hysterical .
In 2003 , my brother from another mother and father Dean Obeidallah and I started the New York Arab-American Comedy Festival , now in its 10th year .
Our goal was to change the negative image of Arab-Americans in media , while also reminding casting directors that South Asian and Arab are not synonymous .
Mainstreaming Arabs was much , much easier than conquering the challenge against the stigma against disability .
My big break came in 2010 .
I was invited to be a guest on the cable news show &quot; Countdown With Keith Olbermann . &quot;
I walked in looking like I was going to the prom , and they shuffle me into a studio and seat me on a spinning , rolling chair .
So I looked at the stage manager and I &apos;m like , &quot; Excuse me , can I have another chair ? &quot;
And she looked at me and she went , &quot; Five , four , three , two ... &quot;
And we were live , right ?
So I had to grip onto the anchor &apos;s desk so that I wouldn &apos;t roll off the screen during the segment , and when the interview was over , I was livid .
I had finally gotten my chance and I blew it , and I knew I would never get invited back .
But not only did Mr. Olbermann invite me back , he made me a full-time contributor , and he taped down my chair .
One fun fact I learned while on the air with Keith Olbermann was that humans on the Internet are scumbags .
People say children are cruel , but I was never made fun of as a child or an adult .
Suddenly , my disability on the world wide web is fair game .
I would look at clips online and see comments like , &quot; Yo , why &apos;s she tweakin ? &quot;
&quot; Yo , is she retarded ? &quot;
And my favorite , &quot; Poor Gumby-mouth terrorist .
What does she suffer from ?
We should really pray for her . &quot;
One commenter even suggested that I add my disability to my credits : screenwriter , comedian , palsy .
Disability is as visual as race .
If a wheelchair user can &apos;t play Beyoncé , then Beyoncé can &apos;t play a wheelchair user .
The disabled are the largest — Yeah , clap for that , man . C &apos;mon .
People with disabilities are the largest minority in the world , and we are the most underrepresented in entertainment .
The doctors said that I wouldn &apos;t walk , but I am here in front of you .
However , if I grew up with social media , I don &apos;t think I would be .
I hope that together we can create more positive images of disability in the media and in everyday life .
Perhaps if there were more positive images , it would foster less hate on the Internet .
Or maybe not .
Maybe it still takes a village to teach our children well .
My crooked journey has taken me to some very spectacular places .
I got to walk the red carpet flanked by soap diva Susan Lucci and the iconic Lorraine Arbus .
I got to act in a movie with Adam Sandler and work with my idol , the amazing Dave Matthews .
I toured the world as a headliner on Arabs Gone Wild .
I was a delegate representing the great state of New Jersey at the 2008 DNC .
And I founded Maysoon &apos;s Kids , a charity that hopes to give Palestinian refugee children a sliver of the chance my parents gave me .
But the one moment that stands out the most was when I got -- before this moment -- — but the one moment that stands out the most was when I got to perform for the man who floats like a butterfly and stings like a bee , has Parkinson &apos;s and shakes just like me , Muhammad Ali .
It was the only time that my father ever saw me perform live , and I dedicate this talk to his memory .
My name is Maysoon Zayid , and if I can can , you can can .


http : / / www.ted.com / talks / jason _ pontin _ can _ technology _ solve _ our _ big _ problems.html
In 1969 , Buzz Aldrin &apos;s historical step onto the moon leapt mankind into an era of technological possibility . The awesome power of technology was to be used to solve all of our big problems . Fast forward to present day , and what &apos;s happened ? Are mobile apps all we have to show for ourselves ? Journalist Jason Pontin looks closely at the challenges we face to using technology effectively ... for problems that really matter .
NASA , astronomy , space , technology
1835
Can technology solve our big problems ?
So , we used to solve big problems .
On July 21st , 1969 , Buzz Aldrin climbed out of Apollo 11 &apos;s lunar module and descended onto the Sea of Tranquility .
Armstrong and Aldrin were alone , but their presence on the moon &apos;s gray surface was the culmination of a convulsive , collective effort .
The Apollo program was the greatest peacetime mobilization in the history of the United States .
To get to the moon , NASA spent around 180 billion dollars in today &apos;s money , or four percent of the federal budget .
Apollo employed around 400,000 people and demanded the collaboration of 20,000 companies , universities and government agencies .
People died , including the crew of Apollo 1 .
But before the Apollo program ended , 24 men flew to the moon .
Twelve walked on its surface , of whom Aldrin , following the death of Armstrong last year , is now the most senior .
So why did they go ?
They didn &apos;t bring much back : 841 pounds of old rocks , and something all 24 later emphasized -- a new sense of the smallness and the fragility of our common home .
Why did they go ? The cynical answer is they went because President Kennedy wanted to show the Soviets that his nation had the better rockets .
But Kennedy &apos;s own words at Rice University in 1962 provide a better clue .
To contemporaries , Apollo wasn &apos;t only a victory of West over East in the Cold War .
At the time , the strongest emotion was of wonder at the transcendent powers of technology .
They went because it was a big thing to do .
Landing on the moon occurred in the context of a long series of technological triumphs .
The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line and the airplane , penicillin and a vaccine for tuberculosis .
In the middle years of the century , polio was eradicated and smallpox eliminated .
Technology itself seemed to possess what Alvin Toffler in 1970 called &quot; accelerative thrust . &quot;
For most of human history , we could go no faster than a horse or a boat with a sail , but in 1969 , the crew of Apollo 10 flew at 25,000 miles an hour .
Since 1970 , no human beings have been back to the moon .
No one has traveled faster than the crew of Apollo 10 , and blithe optimism about technology &apos;s powers has evaporated as big problems we had imagined technology would solve , such as going to Mars , creating clean energy , curing cancer , or feeding the world have come to seem intractably hard .
I remember watching the liftoff of Apollo 17 .
I was five years old , and my mother told me not to stare at the fiery exhaust of a Saturn V rocket .
I vaguely knew this was to be the last of the moon missions , but I was absolutely certain there would be Mars colonies in my lifetime .
So &quot; Something happened to our capacity to solve big problems with technology &quot; has become a commonplace .
You hear it all the time .
We &apos;ve heard it over the last two days here at TED .
It feels as if technologists have diverted us and enriched themselves with trivial toys , with things like iPhones and apps and social media , or algorithms that speed automated trading .
There &apos;s nothing wrong with most of these things .
They &apos;ve expanded and enriched our lives .
But they don &apos;t solve humanity &apos;s big problems .
What happened ?
So there is a parochial explanation in Silicon Valley , which admits that it has been funding less ambitious companies than it did in the years when it financed Intel , Microsoft , Apple and Genentech .
Silicon Valley says the markets are to blame , in particular the incentives that venture capitalists offer to entrepreneurs .
Silicon Valley says that venture investing shifted away from funding transformational ideas and towards funding incremental problems or even fake problems .
But I don &apos;t think that explanation is good enough .
It mostly explains what &apos;s wrong with Silicon Valley .
Even when venture capitalists were at their most risk-happy , they preferred small investments , tiny investments that offered an exit within 10 years .
V.C.s have always struggled to invest profitably in technologies such as energy whose capital requirements are huge and whose development is long and lengthy , and V.C.s have never , never funded the development of technologies meant to solve big problems that possess no immediate commercial value .
No , the reasons we can &apos;t solve big problems are more complicated and more profound .
Sometimes we choose not to solve big problems .
We could go to Mars if we want .
NASA even has the outline of a plan .
But going to Mars would follow a political decision with popular appeal , and that will never happen .
We won &apos;t go to Mars , because everyone thinks there are more important things to do here on Earth .
Sometimes , we can &apos;t solve big problems because our political systems fail .
Today , less than two percent of the world &apos;s energy consumption derives from advanced , renewable sources such as solar , wind and biofuels , less than two percent , and the reason is purely economic .
Coal and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind , and petroleum is cheaper than biofuels .
We want alternative energy sources that can compete on price . None exist .
Now , technologists , business leaders and economists all basically agree on what national policies and international treaties would spur the development of alternative energy : mostly , a significant increase in energy research and development , and some kind of price on carbon .
But there &apos;s no hope in the present political climate that we will see U.S. energy policy or international treaties that reflect that consensus .
Sometimes , big problems that had seemed technological turn out not to be so .
Famines were long understood to be caused by failures in food supply .
But 30 years of research have taught us that famines are political crises that catastrophically affect food distribution .
Technology can improve things like crop yields or systems for storing and transporting food , but there will be famines so long as there are bad governments .
Finally , big problems sometimes elude solution because we don &apos;t really understand the problem .
President Nixon declared war on cancer in 1971 , but we soon discovered there are many kinds of cancer , most of them fiendishly resistant to therapy , and it is only in the last 10 years that effective , viable therapies have come to seem real .
Hard problems are hard .
It &apos;s not true that we can &apos;t solve big problems through technology .
We can , we must , but these four elements must all be present : Political leaders and the public must care to solve a problem ; institutions must support its solution ; It must really be a technological problem ; and we must understand it .
The Apollo mission , which has become a kind of metaphor for technology &apos;s capacity to solve big problems , met these criteria .
But it is an irreproducible model for the future .
It is not 1961 .
There is no galvanizing contest like the Cold War , no politician like John Kennedy who can heroize the difficult and the dangerous , and no popular science fictional mythology such as exploring the solar system .
Most of all , going to the moon turned out to be easy .
It was just three days away .
And arguably it wasn &apos;t even solving much of a problem .
We are left alone with our day , and the solutions of the future will be harder won .
God knows , we don &apos;t lack for the challenges .
Thank you very much .

Leaving a high-flying job in consulting , Angela Lee Duckworth took a job teaching math to seventh graders in a New York public school . She quickly realized that IQ wasn &apos;t the only thing separating the successful students from those who struggled . Here , she explains her theory of &quot; grit &quot; as a predictor of success .

Angela Lee Duckworth : The key to success ? Grit
When I was 27 years old , I left a very demanding job in management consulting for a job that was even more demanding : teaching .
I went to teach seventh graders math in the New York City public schools .
And like any teacher , I made quizzes and tests .
I gave out homework assignments .
When the work came back , I calculated grades .
What struck me was that I.Q. was not the only difference between my best and my worst students .
Some of my strongest performers did not have stratospheric I.Q. scores .
Some of my smartest kids weren &apos;t doing so well .
And that got me thinking .
The kinds of things you need to learn in seventh grade math , sure , they &apos;re hard : ratios , decimals , the area of a parallelogram .
But these concepts are not impossible , and I was firmly convinced that every one of my students could learn the material if they worked hard and long enough .
After several more years of teaching , I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a much better understanding of students and learning from a motivational perspective , from a psychological perspective .
In education , the one thing we know how to measure best is I.Q. , but what if doing well in school and in life depends on much more than your ability to learn quickly and easily ?
So I left the classroom , and I went to graduate school to become a psychologist .
I started studying kids and adults in all kinds of super challenging settings , and in every study my question was , who is successful here and why ?
My research team and I went to West Point Military Academy .
We tried to predict which cadets would stay in military training and which would drop out .
We went to the National Spelling Bee and tried to predict which children would advance farthest in competition .
We studied rookie teachers working in really tough neighborhoods , asking which teachers are still going to be here in teaching by the end of the school year , and of those , who will be the most effective at improving learning outcomes for their students ?
We partnered with private companies , asking , which of these salespeople is going to keep their jobs ?
And who &apos;s going to earn the most money ?
In all those very different contexts , one characteristic emerged as a significant predictor of success .
And it wasn &apos;t social intelligence .
It wasn &apos;t good looks , physical health , and it wasn &apos;t I.Q.
It was grit .
Grit is passion and perseverance for very long-term goals .
Grit is having stamina .
Grit is sticking with your future , day in , day out , not just for the week , not just for the month , but for years , and working really hard to make that future a reality .
Grit is living life like it &apos;s a marathon , not a sprint .
A few years ago , I started studying grit in the Chicago public schools .
I asked thousands of high school juniors to take grit questionnaires , and then waited around more than a year to see who would graduate .
Turns out that grittier kids were significantly more likely to graduate , even when I matched them on every characteristic I could measure , things like family income , standardized achievement test scores , even how safe kids felt when they were at school .
So it &apos;s not just at West Point or the National Spelling Bee that grit matters . It &apos;s also in school , especially for kids at risk for dropping out .
To me , the most shocking thing about grit is how little we know , how little science knows , about building it .
Every day , parents and teachers ask me , &quot; How do I build grit in kids ?
What do I do to teach kids a solid work ethic ?
How do I keep them motivated for the long run ? &quot;
The honest answer is , I don &apos;t know .
What I do know is that talent doesn &apos;t make you gritty .
Our data show very clearly that there are many talented individuals who simply do not follow through on their commitments .
In fact , in our data , grit is usually unrelated or even inversely related to measures of talent .
So far , the best idea I &apos;ve heard about building grit in kids is something called &quot; growth mindset . &quot;
This is an idea developed at Stanford University by Carol Dweck , and it is the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed , that it can change with your effort .
Dr. Dweck has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and grows in response to challenge , they &apos;re much more likely to persevere when they fail , because they don &apos;t believe that failure is a permanent condition .
So growth mindset is a great idea for building grit .
But we need more .
And that &apos;s where I &apos;m going to end my remarks , because that &apos;s where we are .
That &apos;s the work that stands before us .
We need to take our best ideas , our strongest intuitions , and we need to test them .
We need to measure whether we &apos;ve been successful , and we have to be willing to fail , to be wrong , to start over again with lessons learned .
In other words , we need to be gritty about getting our kids grittier .
Thank you .


http : / / www.ted.com / talks / onora _ o _ neill _ what _ we _ don _ t _ understand _ about _ trust.html
Trust is on the decline , and we need to rebuild it . That &apos;s a commonly heard suggestion for making a better world … but , says philosopher Onora O &apos;Neill , we don &apos;t really understand what we &apos;re suggesting . She flips the question , showing us that our three most common ideas about trust are actually misdirected . &lt; em &gt; &lt; / em &gt;
global issues , government , philosophy , politics
1829
Onora O &apos;Neill : What we don &apos;t understand about trust
So I &apos;m going to talk about trust , and I &apos;m going to start by reminding you of the standard views that people have about trust .
I think these are so commonplace , they &apos;ve become clichés of our society .
And I think there are three .
One &apos;s a claim : there has been a great decline in trust , very widely believed .
The second is an aim : we should have more trust .
And the third is a task : we should rebuild trust .
I think that the claim , the aim and the task are all misconceived .
So what I &apos;m going to try to tell you today is a different story about a claim , an aim and a task which I think give one quite a lot better purchase on the matter .
First the claim : Why do people think trust has declined ?
And if I really think about it on the basis of my own evidence , I don &apos;t know the answer .
I &apos;m inclined to think it may have declined in some activities or some institutions and it might have grown in others .
I don &apos;t have an overview .
But , of course , I can look at the opinion polls , and the opinion polls are supposedly the source of a belief that trust has declined .
When you actually look at opinion polls across time , there &apos;s not much evidence for that .
That &apos;s to say , the people who were mistrusted 20 years ago , principally journalists and politicians , are still mistrusted .
And the people who were highly trusted 20 years ago are still rather highly trusted : judges , nurses .
The rest of us are in between , and by the way , the average person in the street is almost exactly midway .
But is that good evidence ?
What opinion polls record is , of course , opinions .
What else can they record ?
So they &apos;re looking at the generic attitudes that people report when you ask them certain questions .
Do you trust politicians ? Do you trust teachers ?
Now if somebody said to you , &quot; Do you trust greengrocers ?
Do you trust fishmongers ?
Do you trust elementary school teachers ? &quot;
you would probably begin by saying , &quot; To do what ? &quot;
And that would be a perfectly sensible response .
And you might say , when you understood the answer to that , &quot; Well , I trust some of them , but not others . &quot;
That &apos;s a perfectly rational thing .
In short , in our real lives , we seek to place trust in a differentiated way .
We don &apos;t make an assumption that the level of trust that we will have in every instance of a certain type of official or office-holder or type of person is going to be uniform .
I might , for example , say that I certainly trust a certain elementary school teacher I know to teach the reception class to read , but in no way to drive the school minibus .
I might , after all , know that she wasn &apos;t a good driver .
I might trust my most loquacious friend to keep a conversation going but not -- but perhaps not to keep a secret .
Simple .
So if we &apos;ve got those evidence in our ordinary lives of the way that trust is differentiated , why do we sort of drop all that intelligence when we think about trust more abstractly ?
I think the polls are very bad guides to the level of trust that actually exists , because they try to obliterate the good judgment that goes into placing trust .
Secondly , what about the aim ?
The aim is to have more trust .
Well frankly , I think that &apos;s a stupid aim .
It &apos;s not what I would aim at .
I would aim to have more trust in the trustworthy but not in the untrustworthy .
In fact , I aim positively to try not to trust the untrustworthy .
And I think , of those people who , for example , placed their savings with the very aptly named Mr. Madoff , who then made off with them , and I think of them , and I think , well , yes , too much trust .
More trust is not an intelligent aim in this life .
Intelligently placed and intelligently refused trust is the proper aim .
Well once one says that , one says , yeah , okay , that means that what matters in the first place is not trust but trustworthiness .
It &apos;s judging how trustworthy people are in particular respects .
And I think that judgment requires us to look at three things .
Are they competent ? Are they honest ? Are they reliable ?
And if we find that a person is competent in the relevant matters , and reliable and honest , we &apos;ll have a pretty good reason to trust them , because they &apos;ll be trustworthy .
But if , on the other hand , they &apos;re unreliable , we might not .
I have friends who are competent and honest , but I would not trust them to post a letter , because they &apos;re forgetful .
I have friends who are very confident they can do certain things , but I realize that they overestimate their own competence .
And I &apos;m very glad to say , I don &apos;t think I have many friends who are competent and reliable but extremely dishonest .
If so , I haven &apos;t yet spotted it .
But that &apos;s what we &apos;re looking for : trustworthiness before trust .
Trust is the response .
Trustworthiness is what we have to judge . And , of course , it &apos;s difficult .
Across the last few decades , we &apos;ve tried to construct systems of accountability for all sorts of institutions and professionals and officials and so on that will make it easier for us to judge their trustworthiness .
A lot of these systems have the converse effect .
They don &apos;t work as they &apos;re supposed to .
I remember I was talking with a midwife who said , &quot; Well , you see , the problem is it takes longer to do the paperwork than to deliver the baby . &quot;
And all over our public life , our institutional life , we find that problem , that the system of accountability that is meant to secure trustworthiness and evidence of trustworthiness is actually doing the opposite .
It is distracting people who have to do difficult tasks , like midwives , from doing them by requiring them to tick the boxes , as we say .
You can all give your own examples there .
So so much for the aim .
The aim , I think , is more trustworthiness , and that is going to be different if we are trying to be trustworthy and communicate our trustworthiness to other people , and if we are trying to judge whether other people or office-holders or politicians are trustworthy .
It &apos;s not easy . It is judgment , and simple reaction , attitudes , don &apos;t do adequately here .
Now thirdly , the task .
Calling the task rebuilding trust , I think , also gets things backwards .
It suggests that you and I should rebuild trust .
Well , we can do that for ourselves .
We can rebuild a bit of trustworthiness .
We can do it two people together trying to improve trust .
But trust , in the end , is distinctive because it &apos;s given by other people .
You can &apos;t rebuild what other people give you .
You have to give them the basis for giving you their trust .
So you have to , I think , be trustworthy .
And that , of course , is because you can &apos;t fool all of the people all of the time , usually .
But you also have to provide usable evidence that you are trustworthy .
How to do it ?
Well every day , all over the place , it &apos;s being done by ordinary people , by officials , by institutions , quite effectively .
Let me give you a simple commercial example .
The shop where I buy my socks says I may take them back , and they don &apos;t ask any questions .
They take them back and give me the money or give me the pair of socks of the color I wanted .
That &apos;s super . I trust them because they have made themselves vulnerable to me .
I think there &apos;s a big lesson in that .
If you make yourself vulnerable to the other party , then that is very good evidence that you are trustworthy and you have confidence in what you are saying .
So in the end , I think what we are aiming for is not very difficult to discern .
It is relationships in which people are trustworthy and can judge when and how the other person is trustworthy .
So the moral of all this is , we need to think much less about trust , let alone about attitudes of trust detected or mis-detected by opinion polls , much more about being trustworthy , and how you give people adequate , useful and simple evidence that you &apos;re trustworthy .
Thanks .

When Colin Stokes &apos; 3-year-old son caught a glimpse of &lt; em &gt; Star Wars &lt; / em &gt; , he was instantly obsessed . But what messages did he absorb from the sci-fi classic ? Stokes asks for more movies that send positive messages to boys : that cooperation is heroic , and respecting women is as manly as defeating the villain .

Colin Stokes : How movies teach manhood
You know , my favorite part of being a dad is the movies I get to watch .
I love sharing my favorite movies with my kids , and when my daughter was four , we got to watch &quot; The Wizard of Oz &quot; together .
It totally dominated her imagination for months .
Her favorite character was Glinda , of course .
It gave her a great excuse to wear a sparkly dress and carry a wand .
But you watch that movie enough times , and you start to realize how unusual it is .
Now we live today , and are raising our children , in a kind of children &apos;s-fantasy-spectacular-industrial complex .
But &quot; The Wizard of Oz &quot; stood alone .
It did not start that trend .
Forty years later was when the trend really caught on , with , interestingly , another movie that featured a metal guy and a furry guy rescuing a girl by dressing up as the enemy &apos;s guards .
Do you know what I &apos;m talking about ?
Yeah .
Now , there &apos;s a big difference between these two movies , a couple of really big differences between &quot; The Wizard of Oz &quot; and all the movies we watch today .
One is there &apos;s very little violence in &quot; The Wizard of Oz . &quot;
The monkeys are rather aggressive , as are the apple trees .
But I think if &quot; The Wizard of Oz &quot; were made today , the wizard would say , &quot; Dorothy , you are the savior of Oz that the prophecy foretold .
Use your magic slippers to defeat the computer-generated armies of the Wicked Witch . &quot;
But that &apos;s not how it happens .
Another thing that &apos;s really unique about &quot; The Wizard of Oz &quot; to me is that all of the most heroic and wise and even villainous characters are female .
Now I started to notice this when I actually showed &quot; Star Wars &quot; to my daughter , which was years later , and the situation was different .
At that point I also had a son .
He was only three at the time .
He was not invited to the screening . He was too young for that .
But he was the second child , and the level of supervision had plummeted .
So he wandered in , and it imprinted on him like a mommy duck does to its duckling , and I don &apos;t think he understands what &apos;s going on , but he is sure soaking in it .
And I wonder what he &apos;s soaking in .
Is he picking up on the themes of courage and perseverance and loyalty ?
Is he picking up on the fact that Luke joins an army to overthrow the government ?
Is he picking up on the fact that there are only boys in the universe except for Aunt Beru , and of course this princess , who &apos;s really cool , but who kind of waits around through most of the movie so that she can award the hero with a medal and a wink to thank him for saving the universe , which he does by the magic that he was born with ?
Compare this to 1939 with &quot; The Wizard of Oz . &quot;
How does Dorothy win her movie ?
By making friends with everybody and being a leader .
That &apos;s kind of the world I &apos;d rather raise my kids in -- Oz , right ? -- and not the world of dudes fighting , which is where we kind of have to be .
Why is there so much Force -- capital F , Force -- in the movies we have for our kids , and so little yellow brick road ?
There is a lot of great writing about the impact that the boy-violent movie has on girls , and you should do that reading . It &apos;s very good .
I haven &apos;t read as much on how boys are picking up on this vibe .
I know from my own experience that Princess Leia did not provide the adequate context that I could have used in navigating the adult world that is co-ed .
I think there was a first-kiss moment when I really expected the credits to start rolling because that &apos;s the end of the movie , right ?
I finished my quest , I got the girl .
Why are you still standing there ?
I don &apos;t know what I &apos;m supposed to do .
The movies are very , very focused on defeating the villain and getting your reward , and there &apos;s not a lot of room for other relationships and other journeys .
It &apos;s almost as though if you &apos;re a boy , you are a dopey animal , and if you are a girl , you should bring your warrior costume .
There are plenty of exceptions , and I will defend the Disney princesses in front of any you .
But they do send a message to boys , that they are not , the boys are not really the target audience .
They are doing a phenomenal job of teaching girls how to defend against the patriarchy , but they are not necessarily showing boys how they &apos;re supposed to defend against the patriarchy .
There &apos;s no models for them .
And we also have some terrific women who are writing new stories for our kids , and as three-dimensional and delightful as Hermione and Katniss are , these are still war movies .
And , of course , the most successful studio of all time continues to crank out classic after classic , every single one of them about the journey of a boy , or a man , or two men who are friends , or a man and his son , or two men who are raising a little girl .
Until , as many of you are thinking , this year , when they finally came out with &quot; Brave . &quot;
I recommend it to all of you . It &apos;s on demand now .
Do you remember what the critics said when &quot; Brave &quot; came out ?
&quot; Aw , I can &apos;t believe Pixar made a princess movie . &quot;
It &apos;s very good . Don &apos;t let that stop you .
Now , almost none of these movies pass the Bechdel Test .
I don &apos;t know if you &apos;ve heard of this .
It has not yet caught on and caught fire , but maybe today we will start a movement .
Alison Bechdel is a comic book artist , and back in the mid- &apos; 80s , she recorded this conversation she &apos;d had with a friend about assessing the movies that they saw .
And it &apos;s very simple . There &apos;s just three questions you should ask : Is there more than one character in the movie that is female who has lines ?
So try to meet that bar .
And do these women talk to each other at any point in the movie ?
And is their conversation about something other than the guy that they both like ?
Right ? Thank you .
Thank you very much .
Two women who exist and talk to each other about stuff .
It does happen . I &apos;ve seen it , and yet I very rarely see it in the movies that we know and love .
In fact , this week I went to see a very high-quality movie , &quot; Argo . &quot;
Right ? Oscar buzz , doing great at the box office , a consensus idea of what a quality Hollywood film is .
It pretty much flunks the Bechdel test .
And I don &apos;t think it should , because a lot of the movie , I don &apos;t know if you &apos;ve seen it , but a lot of the movie takes place in this embassy where men and women are hiding out during the hostage crisis .
We &apos;ve got quite a few scenes of the men having deep , angst-ridden conversations in this hideout , and the great moment for one of the actresses is to peek through the door and say , &quot; Are you coming to bed , honey ? &quot;
That &apos;s Hollywood for you .
So let &apos;s look at the numbers .
2011 , of the 100 most popular movies , how many of them do you think actually have female protagonists ?
Eleven . It &apos;s not bad .
It &apos;s not as many percent as the number of women we &apos;ve just elected to Congress , so that &apos;s good .
But there is a number that is greater than this that &apos;s going to bring this room down .
Last year , The New York Times published a study that the government had done .
Here &apos;s what it said .
One out of five women in America say that they have been sexually assaulted some time in their life .
Now , I don &apos;t think that &apos;s the fault of popular entertainment .
I don &apos;t think kids &apos; movies have anything to do with that .
I don &apos;t even think that music videos or pornography are really directly related to that , but something is going wrong , and when I hear that statistic , one of the things I think of is that &apos;s a lot of sexual assailants .
Who are these guys ? What are they learning ?
What are they failing to learn ?
Are they absorbing the story that a male hero &apos;s job is to defeat the villain with violence and then collect the reward , which is a woman who has no friends and doesn &apos;t speak ?
Are we soaking up that story ?
You know , as a parent with the privilege of raising a daughter like all of you who are doing the same thing , we find this world and this statistic very alarming and we want to prepare them .
We have tools at our disposal like &quot; girl power , &quot; and we hope that that will help , but I gotta wonder , is girl power going to protect them if , at the same time , actively or passively , we are training our sons to maintain their boy power ?
I mean , I think the Netflix queue is one way that we can do something very important , and I &apos;m talking mainly to the dads here .
I think we have got to show our sons a new definition of manhood .
The definition of manhood is already turning upside down .
You &apos;ve read about how the new economy is changing the roles of caregiver and wage earner .
They &apos;re throwing it up in the air .
So our sons are going to have to find some way of adapting to this , some new relationship with each other , and I think we really have to show them , and model for them , how a real man is someone who trusts his sisters and respects them , and wants to be on their team , and stands up against the real bad guys , who are the men who want to abuse the women .
And I think our job in the Netflix queue is to look out for those movies that pass the Bechdel Test , if we can find them , and to seek out the heroines who are there , who show real courage , who bring people together , and to nudge our sons to identify with those heroines and to say , &quot; I want to be on their team , &quot; because they &apos;re going to be on their team .
When I asked my daughter who her favorite character was in &quot; Star Wars , &quot; do you know what she said ?
Obi-Wan .
Obi-Wan Kenobi and Glinda .
What do these two have in common ?
Maybe it &apos;s not just the sparkly dress .
I think these people are experts .
I think these are the two people in the movie who know more than anybody else , and they love sharing their knowledge with other people to help them reach their potential .
Now , they are leaders .
I like that kind of quest for my daughter , and I like that kind of quest for my son .
I want more quests like that .
I want fewer quests where my son is told , &quot; Go out and fight it alone , &quot; and more quests where he sees that it &apos;s his job to join a team , maybe a team led by women , to help other people become better and be better people , like the Wizard of Oz .
Thank you .

Sarah Parcak : Archeology from space
When I was a child growing up in Maine , one of my favorite things to do was to look for sand dollars on the seashores of Maine , because my parents told me it would bring me luck .
But you know , these shells , they &apos;re hard to find .
They &apos;re covered in sand . They &apos;re difficult to see .
However , overtime , I got used to looking for them .
I started seeing shapes and patterns that helped me to collect them .
This grew into a passion for finding things , a love for the past and archaeology .
And eventually when I started studying Egyptology , I realized that seeing with my naked eyes alone wasn &apos;t enough .
Because all of the sudden in Egypt my beach had grown from a tiny beach in Maine to one eight hundred miles long next to the Nile , and my sand dollars had grown to the size of cities .
This is really what brought me to using satellite imagery .
For trying to map the past , I knew that I had to see differently .
So I want to show you an example of how we see differently using the infrared .
This is a site located in the eastern Egyptian delta called Bendix .
And the site visibly appears brown , but when we use the infrared and we process it , all of the sudden , using false color , the site appears as bright pink .
What you are seeing are the actual chemical changes to the landscape caused by the building materials and activities of the ancient Egyptians .
What I want to share with you today is how we &apos;ve used satellite data to find an ancient Egyptian city , called Itjtawy , missing for thousands of years .
Itjtawy was ancient Egypt &apos;s capital for over four hundred years , at a period of time called the Middle Kingdom about four thousand years ago .
The site is located in the Faiyum of Egypt and site is really important because in the Middle Kingdom there was this great renaissance for ancient Egyptian art , architecture and religion .
Egyptologists have always known the site of Itjtawy was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings who built it , indicated within the red circles here , but somewhere within this massive flood plane .
This area is huge -- it &apos;s four miles by three miles in size .
The Nile used to flow right next to the city of Itjtawy , and as it shifted and changed and moved over time to the east , it covered over the city .
So , how do you find a buried city in a vast landscape ?
Finding it randomly would be the equivalent of locating a needle in a haystack , blindfolded wearing baseball mitts .
So what we did is we used NASA topography data to map out the landscape , very subtle changes .
We started to be able to see where the Nile used to flow .
But you can see in more detail -- and even more interesting -- this very slight raised area seen within the circle up here , which we thought could possibly be the location of the city of Itjtawy .
So we collaborated with the Egyptian scientists to do coring work , which you see here .
When I say coring , it &apos;s like ice coring , but instead of layers of climate change you &apos;re looking for layers of human occupation .
And five meters down , underneath a thick layer of mud , we found a dense layer of pottery .
What this shows is that at this possible location of Itjtawy , five meters down , we have of layer of occupation for several hundred years dating to the Middle Kingdom , dating to the exact period of time we think Itjtawy is .
We also found work stone -- carnelian , quartz and agate that shows that there was a jewelers workshop here .
These might not look like much , but when you think about the most common stones used in jewelry from the Middle Kingdom , these are the stones that were used .
So , we have a dense layer of occupation dating to the Middle Kingdom at this site .
We also have evidence of an elite jewelers workshop , showing that whatever was there was a very important city .
No Itjtawy was here yet , but we &apos;re going to be returning to the site in the near future to map it out .
And even more importantly , we have funding to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology so they can be the ones making great discoveries as well .
So I wanted to end with my favorite quote from the Middle Kingdom -- it was probably written at the city of Itjtawy four thousand years ago .
&quot; Sharing knowledge is the greatest of all callings .
There &apos;s nothing like it in the land . &quot;
So as it turns out , TED was not founded in 1984 AD .
Making ideas actually started in 1984 BC at a not-lost-for-long city , found from above .
It certainly puts finding seashells by the seashore in perspective .
Thank you very much .
Thank you .

For foreigners , learning to speak Chinese is a hard task . But learning to read the beautiful , often complex characters of the Chinese written language may be less difficult . ShaoLan walks through a simple lesson in recognizing the ideas behind the characters and their meaning -- building from a few simple forms to more complex concepts . Call it Chineasy .

1736
ShaoLan : Learn to read Chinese ... with ease !
Growing up in Taiwan as the daughter of a calligrapher , one of my most treasured memories was my mother showing me the beauty , the shape and the form of Chinese characters .
Ever since then , I was fascinated by this incredible language .
But to an outsider , it seems to be as impenetrable as the Great Wall of China .
Over the past few years , I &apos;ve been wondering if I can break down this wall , so anyone who wants to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language could do so .
I started thinking about how a new , fast method of learning Chinese might be useful .
Since the age of five , I started to learn how to draw every single stroke for each character in the correct sequence .
I learned new characters every day during the course of the next 15 years .
Since we only have five minutes , it &apos;s better that we have a fast and simpler way .
A Chinese scholar would understand 20,000 characters .
You only need 1,000 to understand the basic literacy .
The top 200 will allow you to comprehend 40 percent of basic literature -- enough to read road signs , restaurant menus , to understand the basic idea of the web pages or the newspapers .
Today I &apos;m going to start with eight to show you how the method works .
You are ready ?
Open your mouth as wide as possible until it &apos;s square .
You get a mouth .
This is a person going for a walk .
Person .
If the shape of the fire is a person with two arms on both sides , as if she was yelling frantically , &quot; Help ! I &apos;m on fire ! &quot; -- This symbol actually is originally from the shape of the flame , but I like to think that way . Whichever works for you .
This is a tree .
Tree .
This is a mountain .
The sun .
The moon .
The symbol of the door looks like a pair of saloon doors in the wild west .
I call these eight characters radicals .
They are the building blocks for you to create lots more characters .
A person .
If someone walks behind , that is &quot; to follow . &quot;
As the old saying goes , two is company , three is a crowd .
If a person stretched their arms wide , this person is saying , &quot; It was this big . &quot;
The person inside the mouth , the person is trapped .
He &apos;s a prisoner , just like Jonah inside the whale .
One tree is a tree . Two trees together , we have the woods .
Three trees together , we create the forest .
Put a plank underneath the tree , we have the foundation .
Put a mouth on the top of the tree , that &apos;s &quot; idiot . &quot;
Easy to remember , since a talking tree is pretty idiotic .
Remember fire ?
Two fires together , I get really hot .
Three fires together , that &apos;s a lot of flames .
Set the fire underneath the two trees , it &apos;s burning .
For us , the sun is the source of prosperity .
Two suns together , prosperous .
Three together , that &apos;s sparkles .
Put the sun and the moon shining together , it &apos;s brightness .
It also means tomorrow , after a day and a night .
The sun is coming up above the horizon . Sunrise .
A door . Put a plank inside the door , it &apos;s a door bolt .
Put a mouth inside the door , asking questions .
Knock knock . Is anyone home ?
This person is sneaking out of a door , escaping , evading .
On the left , we have a woman .
Two women together , they have an argument .
Three women together , be careful , it &apos;s adultery .
So we have gone through almost 30 characters .
By using this method , the first eight radicals will allow you to build 32 .
The next group of eight characters will build an extra 32 .
So with very little effort , you will be able to learn a couple hundred characters , which is the same as a Chinese eight-year-old .
So after we know the characters , we start building phrases .
For example , the mountain and the fire together , we have fire mountain . It &apos;s a volcano .
We know Japan is the land of the rising sun .
This is a sun placed with the origin , because Japan lies to the east of China .
So a sun , origin together , we build Japan .
A person behind Japan , what do we get ?
A Japanese person .
The character on the left is two mountains stacked on top of each other .
In ancient China , that means in exile , because Chinese emperors , they put their political enemies in exile beyond mountains .
Nowadays , exile has turned into getting out .
A mouth which tells you where to get out is an exit .
This is a slide to remind me that I should stop talking and get off of the stage . Thank you .



&lt; url &gt; http : / / www.ted.com / talks / john _ lloyd _ inventories _ the _ invisible.html &lt; / url &gt;
So the question is , what is invisible ?
There is more of it than you think , actually .
Everything , I would say . Everything that matters except every thing and except matter .
We can see matter . But we can &apos;t see what &apos;s the matter .
As in this cryptic sentence I found in The Guardian recently : &quot; The marriage suffered a setback in 1965 , when the husband was killed by the wife . &quot;
There &apos;s a world of invisibility there , isn &apos;t there ?
So , we can see the stars and the planets , but we can &apos;t see what holds them apart or what draws them together .
With matter , as with people , we see only the skin of things .
We can &apos;t see into the engine room .
We can &apos;t see what makes people tick , at least not without difficulty .
And the closer we look at anything , the more it disappears .
In fact , if you look really closely at stuff , if you look at the basic substructure of matter , there isn &apos;t anything there .
Electrons disappear in a kind of fuzz , and there is only energy . And you can &apos;t see energy .
So everything that matters , that &apos;s important , is invisible .
One slightly silly thing that &apos;s invisible is this story , which is invisible to you .
And I &apos;m now going to make it visible to you in your minds .
It &apos;s about an M.P. called Geoffrey Dickens .
The late Geoffrey Dickens , M.P. was attending a fete in his constituency .
Wherever he went , at every stall he stopped he was closely followed by a devoted smiling woman of indescribable ugliness .
Try as he might , he couldn &apos;t get away from her .
A few days later he received a letter from a constituent saying how much she admired him , had met him at a fete and asking for a signed photograph .
After her name , written in brackets was the apt description , horse face .
&quot; I &apos;ve misjudged this women , &quot; thought Mr. Dickens .
&quot; Not only is she aware of her physical repulsiveness , she turns it to her advantage .
A photo is not enough . &quot;
So he went out and bought a plastic frame to put the photograph in .
And on the photograph , he wrote with a flourish , &quot; To Horse Face , with love from Geoffrey Dickens , M.P. &quot;
After it had been sent off , his secretary said to him , &quot; Did you get that letter from the woman at the fete ?
I wrote Horse Face on her , so you &apos;d remember who she was . &quot;
I bet he thought he wished he was invisible , don &apos;t you ?
So , one of the interesting things about invisibility is that things that we can &apos;t see we also can &apos;t understand .
Gravity is one thing that we can &apos;t see and which we don &apos;t understand .
It &apos;s the least understood of all the four fundamental forces , and the weakest .
And nobody really knows what it is or why it &apos;s there .
For what it &apos;s worth , Sir Isaac Newton , the greatest scientist who ever lived , he thought Jesus came to Earth specifically to operate the levers of gravity .
That &apos;s what he thought he was there for .
So , bright guy , could be wrong on that one , I don &apos;t know .
Consciousness . I see all your faces .
I have no idea what any of you are thinking . Isn &apos;t that amazing ?
Isn &apos;t that incredible that we can &apos;t read each other &apos;s minds ?
But we can touch each other , taste each other perhaps , if we get close enough .
But we can &apos;t read each other &apos;s minds . I find that quite astonishing .
In the Sufi faith , this great Middle Eastern religion , which some claim is the route of all religions , Sufi masters are all telepaths , so they say .
But their main exercise of telepathy is to send out powerful signals to the rest of us that it doesn &apos;t exist .
So that &apos;s why we don &apos;t think it exists , the Sufi masters working on us .
In the question of consciousness and artificial intelligence , artificial intelligence has really , like the study of consciousness , gotten nowhere . We have no idea how consciousness works .
With artificial intelligence , not only have they not created artificial intelligence , they haven &apos;t yet created artificial stupidity .
The laws of physics : invisible , eternal , omnipresent , all-powerful .
Remind you of anyone ?
Interesting . I &apos;m , as you can guess , not a materialist , I &apos;m an immaterialist .
And I &apos;ve found a very useful new word , ignostic . Okay ?
I &apos;m an ignostic .
I refuse to be drawn on the question of whether God exists , until somebody properly defines the terms .
Another thing we can &apos;t see is the human genome .
And this is increasingly peculiar , because about 20 years ago , when they started delving into the genome , they thought it would probably contain around 100,000 genes .
Geneticists will know this , but every year since , it &apos;s been revised downwards .
We now think there are likely to be only just over 20,000 genes in the human genome .
This is extraordinary . Because rice -- get this -- rice is known to have 38 thousand genes .
Potatoes , potatoes have 48 chromosomes . Do you know that ?
Two more than people , and the same as a gorilla .
You can &apos;t see these things , but they are very strange .
The stars by day . I always think that &apos;s fascinating .
The universe disappears .
The more light there is , the less you can see .
Time , nobody can see time .
I don &apos;t know if you know this . Modern physics , there is a big movement in modern physics to decide that time doesn &apos;t really exist , because it &apos;s too inconvenient for the figures .
It &apos;s much easier if it &apos;s not really there .
You can &apos;t see the future , obviously .
And you can &apos;t see the past , except in your memory .
One of the interesting things about the past is you particularly can &apos;t see . My son asked me this the other day , he said , &quot; Dad , can you remember what I was like when I was two ? &quot;
And I said , &quot; Yes . &quot; And he said , &quot; Why can &apos;t I ? &quot;
Isn &apos;t that extraordinary ? You cannot remember what happened to you earlier than the age of two or three , which is great news for psychoanalysts , because otherwise they &apos;d be out of a job .
Because that &apos;s where all the stuff happens that makes you who you are .
Another thing you can &apos;t see is the grid on which we hang .
This is fascinating . You probably know , some of you , that cells are continually renewed . You can see it in skin and this kind of stuff .
Skin flakes off , hairs grow , nails , that kind of stuff .
But every cell in your body is replaced at some point .
Taste buds , every 10 days or so .
Livers and internal organs sort of take a bit longer . A spine takes several years .
But at the end of seven years , not one cell in your body remains from what was there seven years ago .
The question is , who , then , are we ?
What are we ? What is this thing that we hang on , that is actually us ?
Okay . Atoms , you can &apos;t see them .
Nobody ever will . They &apos;re smaller than the wavelength of light .
Gas , you can &apos;t see that .
Interesting . Somebody mentioned 1600 recently .
Gas was invented in 1600 by a Dutch chemist called Van Helmont .
It &apos;s said to be the most successful ever invention of a word by a known individual .
Quite good . He also invented a word called &quot; blas , &quot; meaning astral radiation .
Didn &apos;t catch on , unfortunately .
But well done , him .
There is so many things that -- Light .
You can &apos;t see light . When it &apos;s dark , in a vacuum , if a person shines a beam of light straight across your eyes , you won &apos;t see it . Slightly technical , some physicists will disagree with this .
But it &apos;s odd that you can &apos;t see the beam of light , you can only see what it hits .
I find that extraordinary , not to be able to see light , not to be able to see darkness .
Electricity , you can &apos;t see that .
Don &apos;t let anyone tell you they understand electricity .
They don &apos;t . Nobody knows what it is .
You probably think the electrons in an electric wire move instantaneously down a wire , don &apos;t you , at the speed of light when you turn the light on . They don &apos;t .
Electrons bumble down the wire , about the speed of spreading honey , they say .
Galaxies , 100 billion of them estimated in the universe .
100 billion . How many can we see ? Five .
Five out of the 100 billion galaxies , with the naked eye , and one of them is quite difficult to see unless you &apos;ve got very good eyesight .
Radio waves . There &apos;s another thing .
Heinrich Hertz , when he discovered radio waves in 1887 , he called them radio waves because they radiated .
And somebody said to him , &quot; Well what &apos;s the point of these , Heinrich ?
What &apos;s the point of these radio waves that you &apos;ve found ? &quot;
And he said , &quot; Well , I &apos;ve no idea .
But I guess somebody will find a use for them someday . &quot;
And that &apos;s what they do , radio . That &apos;s what they discovered .
Anyway , so the biggest thing that &apos;s invisible to us is what we don &apos;t know .
It is incredible how little we know .
Thomas Edison once said , &quot; We don &apos;t know one percent of one millionth about anything . &quot;
And I &apos;ve come to the conclusion -- because you &apos;ve asked this other question , &quot; What &apos;s another thing you can &apos;t see ? &quot;
The point , most of us . What &apos;s the point ?
You can &apos;t see a point . It &apos;s by definition dimensionless , like an electron , oddly enough .
But the point , what I &apos;ve got it down to , is there are only two questions really worth asking .
&quot; Why are we here ? &quot; and &quot; What should we do about it while we are ?
And to help you , I &apos;ve got two things to leave you with , from two great philosophers , perhaps two of the greatest philosopher thinkers of the 20th century , one a mathematician and an engineer , and the other a poet .
The first is Ludwig Wittgenstein who said , &quot; I don &apos;t know why we are here .
But I &apos;m pretty sure it &apos;s not in order to enjoy ourselves . &quot;
He was a cheerful bastard wasn &apos;t he ?
And secondly and lastly , W.H. Auden , one of my favorite poets , who said , &quot; We are here on earth to help others .
What the others are here for , I &apos;ve no idea . &quot;

The global challenge that I want to talk to you about today rarely makes the front pages .
It , however , is enormous in both scale and importance .
Look , you all are very well traveled ; this is TEDGlobal after all .
But I do hope to take you to some places you &apos;ve never been to before .
So , let &apos;s start off in China .
This photo was taken two weeks ago .
Actually , one indication is that little boy on my husband &apos;s shoulders has just graduated from high school .
But this is Tiananmen Square .
Many of you have been there . It &apos;s not the real China .
Let me take you to the real China .
This is in the Dabian Mountains in the remote part of Hubei province in central China .
Dai Manju is 13 years old at the time the story starts .
She lives with her parents , her two brothers and her great-aunt .
They have a hut that has no electricity , no running water , no wristwatch , no bicycle .
And they share this great splendor with a very large pig .
Dai Manju was in sixth grade when her parents said , &quot; We &apos;re going to pull you out of school because the 13-dollar school fees are too much for us .
You &apos;re going to be spending the rest of your life in the rice paddies .
Why would we waste this money on you ? &quot;
This is what happens to girls in remote areas .
Turns out that Dai Manju was the best pupil in her grade .
She still made the two-hour trek to the schoolhouse and tried to catch every little bit of information that seeped out of the doors .
We wrote about her in The New York Times .
We got a flood of donations -- mostly 13-dollar checks because New York Times readers are very generous in tiny amounts but then , we got a money transfer for $ 10,000 -- really nice guy .
We turned the money over to that man there , the principal of the school .
He was delighted .
He thought , &quot; Oh , I can renovate the school .
I can give scholarships to all the girls , you know , if they work hard and stay in school .
So Dai Manju basically finished out middle school .
She went to high school .
She went to vocational school for accounting .
She scouted for jobs down in Guangdong province in the south .
She found a job , she scouted for jobs for her classmates and her friends .
She sent money back to her family .
They built a new house , this time with running water , electricity , a bicycle , no pig .
What we saw was a natural experiment .
It is rare to get an exogenous investment in girls &apos; education .
And over the years , as we followed Dai Manju , we were able to see that she was able to move out of a vicious cycle and into a virtuous cycle .
She not only changed her own dynamic , she changed her household , she changed her family , her village .
The village became a real standout .
Of course , most of China was flourishing at the time , but they were able to get a road built to link them up to the rest of China .
And that brings me to my first major of two tenets of &quot; Half the Sky . &quot;
And that is that the central moral challenge of this century is gender inequity .
In the 19th century , it was slavery .
In the 20th century , it was totalitarianism .
The cause of our time is the brutality that so many people face around the world because of their gender .
So some of you may be thinking , &quot; Gosh , that &apos;s hyperbole .
She &apos;s exaggerating . &quot;
Well , let me ask you this question .
How many of you think there are more males or more females in the world ?
Let me take a poll . How many of you think there are more males in the world ?
Hands up , please .
How many of you think -- a few -- how many of you there are more females in the world ?
Okay , most of you .
Well , you know this latter group , you &apos;re wrong .
There are , true enough , in Europe and the West , when women and men have equal access to food and health care , there are more women , we live longer .
But in most of the rest of the world , that &apos;s not the case .
In fact , demographers have shown that there are anywhere between 60 million and 100 million missing females in the current population .
And , you know , it happens for several reasons .
For instance , in the last half-century , more girls were discriminated to death than all the people killed on all the battlefields in the 20th century .
Sometimes it &apos;s also because of the sonogram .
Girls get aborted before they &apos;re even born when there are scarce resources .
This girl here , for instance , is in a feeding center in Ethiopia .
The entire center was filled with girls like her .
What &apos;s remarkable is that her brothers , in the same family , were totally fine .
In India , in the first year of life , from zero to one , boy and girl babies basically survive at the same rate because they depend upon the breast , and the breast shows no son preference .
From one to five , girls die at a 50 percent higher mortality rate than boys , in all of India .
The second tenet of &quot; Half the Sky &quot; is that , let &apos;s put aside the morality of all the right and wrong of it all , and just on a purely practical level , we think that one of the best ways to fight poverty and to fight terrorism is to educate girls and to bring women into the formal labor force .
Poverty , for instance .
There are three reasons why this is the case .
For one , overpopulation is one of the persistent causes of poverty .
And you know , when you educate a boy , his family tends to have fewer kids , but only slightly .
When you educate a girl , she tends to have significantly fewer kids .
The second reason is it has to do with spending .
It &apos;s kind of like the dirty , little secret of poverty , which is that , not only do poor people take in very little income , but also , the income that they take in , they don &apos;t spend it very wisely , and unfortunately , most of that spending is done by men .
So research has shown , if you look at people who live under two dollars a day -- one metric of poverty -- two percent of that take-home pay goes to this basket here , in education .
20 percent goes to a basket that is a combination of alcohol , tobacco , sugary drinks -- and prostitution and festivals .
If you just take four percentage points and put it into this basket , you would have a transformative effect .
The last reason has to do with women being part of the solution , not the problem .
You need to use scarce resources .
It &apos;s a waste of resources if you don &apos;t use someone like Dai Manju .
Bill Gates put it very well when he was traveling through Saudi Arabia .
He was speaking to an audience much like yourselves .
However , two-thirds of the way there was a barrier .
On this side was men , and then the barrier , and this side was women .
And someone from this side of the room got up and said , &quot; Mr. Gates , we have here as our goal in Saudi Arabia to be one of the top 10 countries when it comes to technology .
Do you think we &apos;ll make it ? &quot;
So Bill Gates , as he was staring out at the audience , he said , &quot; If you &apos;re not fully utilizing half the resources in your country , there is no way you will get anywhere near the top 10 . &quot;
So here is Bill of Arabia .
So what would some of the specific challenges look like ?
I would say , on the top of the agenda is sex trafficking .
And I &apos;ll just say two things about this .
The slavery at the peak of the slave trade in the 1780s : there were about 80,000 slaves transported from Africa to the New World .
Now , modern slavery : according to State Department rough statistics , there are about 800,000 -- 10 times the number -- that are trafficked across international borders .
And that does not even include those that are trafficked within country borders , which is a substantial portion .
another factor , another contrast , a slave back then is worth about $ 40,000 in today &apos;s money .
Today , you can buy a girl trafficked for a few hundred dollars , which means she &apos;s actually more disposable .
But you know , there is progress being made in places like Cambodia and Thailand .
We don &apos;t have to expect a world where girls are bought and sold or killed .
The second item on the agenda is maternal mortality .
You know , childbirth in this part of the world is a wonderful event .
In Niger , one in seven women can expect to die during childbirth .
Around the world , one woman dies every minute and a half from childbirth .
You know , it &apos;s not as though we don &apos;t have the technological solution , but these women have three strikes against them : they are poor , they are rural and they are female .
You know , for every woman who does die , there are 20 who survive but end up with an injury .
And the most devastating injury is obstetric fistula .
It &apos;s a tearing during obstructed labor that leaves a woman incontinent .
Let me tell you about Mahabuba .
She lives in Ethiopia .
She was married against her will at age 13 .
She got pregnant , ran to the bush to have the baby , but you know , her body was very immature , and she ended up having obstructed labor .
The baby died , and she ended up with a fistula .
So that meant she was incontinent ; she couldn &apos;t control her wastes .
In a word , she stank .
The villagers thought she was cursed ; they didn &apos;t know what to do with her .
So finally , they put her at the edge of the village in a hut .
They ripped off the door so that the hyenas would get her at night .
That night , there was a stick in the hut .
She fought off the hyenas with that stick .
And the next morning , she knew if she could get to a nearby village where there was a foreign missionary , she would be saved .
Because she had some damage to her nerves , she crawled all the way -- 30 miles -- to that doorstep , half dead .
The foreign missionary opened the door , knew exactly what had happened , took her to a nearby fistula hospital in Addis Ababa , and she was repaired with a 350-dollar operation .
The doctors and nurses there noticed that she was not only a survivor , she was really clever , and they made her a nurse .
So now , Mahabuba , she is saving the lives of hundreds , thousands , of women .
She has become part of the solution , not the problem .
She &apos;s moved out of a vicious cycle and into a virtuous cycle .
I &apos;ve talked about some of the challenges , let me talk about some of the solutions , and there are predictable solutions .
I &apos;ve hinted at them : education and also economic opportunity .
So of course , when you educate a girl , she tends to get married later on in life , she tends to have kids later on in life , she tends to have fewer kids , and those kids that she does have , she educates them in a more enlightened fashion .
With economic opportunity , it can be transformative .
Let me tell you about Saima .
She lives in a small village outside Lahore , Pakistan .
And at the time , she was miserable .
She was beaten every single day by her husband , who was unemployed .
He was kind of a gambler type -- and unemployable , therefore -- and took his frustrations out on her .
Well , when she had her second daughter , her mother in-law told her son , &quot; I think you &apos;d better get a second wife .
Saima &apos;s not going to produce you a son . &quot;
This is when she had her second daughter .
At the time , there was a microlending group in the village that gave her a 65-dollar loan .
Saima took that money , and she started an embroidery business .
The merchants liked her embroidery ; it sold very well , and they kept asking for more .
And when she couldn &apos;t produce enough , she hired other women in the village .
Pretty soon she had 30 women in the village working for her embroidery business .
And then , from the village to the marketplace , she needed someone to help her do the transport , so she hired her husband .
So now they &apos;re in it together .
He does the transportation and distribution , and she does the production and sourcing .
And now they have a third daughter , and the daughters , all of them , are being tutored in education because Saima knows what &apos;s really important .
Which brings me to the final element , which is education .
Larry Summers , when he was chief economist at the World Bank , once said that , &quot; It may well be that the highest return on investment in the developing world is in girls &apos; education . &quot;
Let me tell you about Beatrice Biira .
Beatrice was living in Uganda near the Congo border , and like Dai Manju , she didn &apos;t go to school .
Actually , she had never been to school , not to a lick , one day .
Her parents , again , said , &quot; Why should we spend the money on her ?
She &apos;s going to spend most of her life lugging water back and forth . &quot;
Well , it just so happens , at that time , there was a group in Connecticut called the Niantic Community Church Group in Connecticut .
They made a donation to an organization based in Arkansas called Heifer International .
Heifer sent two goats to Africa .
One of them ended up with Beatrice &apos;s parents , and that goat had twins .
The twins started producing milk .
They sold the milk for cash .
The cash started accumulating , and pretty soon the parents said , &quot; You know , we &apos;ve got enough money . Let &apos;s send Beatrice to school . &quot;
So at nine years of age , Beatrice started in first grade -- after all , she &apos;d never been to a lick of school -- with a six year-old .
No matter , she was just delighted to be in school .
She rocketed to the top of her class .
She stayed at the top of her class through elementary school , middle school , and then in high school , she scored brilliantly on the national examinations so that she became the first person in her village , ever , to come to the United States on scholarship .
Two years ago , she graduated from Connecticut College .
On the day of her graduation , she said , &quot; I am the luckiest girl alive because of a goat . &quot;
And that goat was $ 120 .
So you see how transformative little bits of help can be .
But I want to give you a reality check .
Look : U.S. aid , helping people is not easy , and there have been books that have criticized U.S. aid .
There &apos;s Bill Easterly &apos;s book .
There &apos;s a book called &quot; Dead Aid . &quot;
You know , the criticism is fair ; it isn &apos;t easy .
You know , people say how half of all water well projects , a year later , are failed .
When I was in Zimbabwe , we were touring a place with the village chief -- he wanted to raise money for a secondary school -- and there was some construction a few yards away , and I said , &quot; What &apos;s that ? &quot;
He sort of mumbled .
Turns out that it &apos;s a failed irrigation project .
A few yards away was a failed chicken coop .
One year , all the chickens died , and no one wanted to put the chickens in there .
It &apos;s true , but we think that you don &apos;t through the baby out with the bathwater ; you actually improve .
You learn from your mistakes , and you continuously improve .
We also think that individuals can make a difference , and they should , because individuals , together , we can all help create a movement .
And a movement of men and women is what &apos;s needed to bring about social change , change that will address this great moral challenge .
So then , I ask , what &apos;s in it for you ?
You &apos;re probably asking that . Why should you care ?
I will just leave you with two things .
One is that research shows that once you have all of your material needs taken care of -- which most of us , all of us , here in this room do -- research shows that there are very few things in life that can actually elevate your level of happiness .
One of those things is contributing to a cause larger than yourself .
And the second thing , it &apos;s an anecdote that I &apos;ll leave you with .
And that is the story of an aid worker in Darfur .
Here was a woman who had worked in Darfur , seeing things that no human being should see .
Throughout her time there , she was strong , she was steadfast .
She never broke down .
And then she came back to the United States and was on break , Christmas break .
She was in her grandmother &apos;s backyard , and she saw something that made her break down in tears .
What that was was a bird feeder .
And she realized that she had the great fortune to be born in a country where we take security for granted , where we not only can feed , clothe and house ourselves , but also provide for wild birds so they don &apos;t go hungry in the winter .
And she realized that with that great fortune comes great responsibility .
And so , like her , you , me , we have all won the lottery of life .
And so the question becomes : how do we discharge that responsibility ?
So , here &apos;s the cause .
Join the movement .
Feel happier and help save the world .
Thank you very much .

Each of you possesses the most powerful , dangerous and subversive trait that natural selection has ever devised .
It &apos;s a piece of neural audio technology for rewiring other people &apos;s minds .
I &apos;m talking about your language , of course , because it allows you to implant a thought from your mind directly into someone else &apos;s mind , and they can attempt to do the same to you , without either of you having to perform surgery .
Instead , when you speak , you &apos;re actually using a form of telemetry not so different from the remote control device for your television .
It &apos;s just that , whereas that device relies on pulses of infrared light , your language relies on pulses , discrete pulses , of sound .
And just as you use the remote control device to alter the internal settings of your television to suit your mood , you use your language to alter the settings inside someone else &apos;s brain to suit your interests .
Languages are genes talking , getting things that they want .
And just imagine the sense of wonder in a baby when it first discovers that , merely by uttering a sound , it can get objects to move across a room as if by magic , and maybe even into its mouth .
Now language &apos;s subversive power has been recognized throughout the ages in censorship , in books you can &apos;t read , phrases you can &apos;t use and words you can &apos;t say .
In fact , the Tower of Babel story in the Bible is a fable and warning about the power of language .
According to that story , early humans developed the conceit that , by using their language to work together , they could build a tower that would take them all the way to heaven .
Now God , angered at this attempt to usurp his power , destroyed the tower , and then to ensure that it would never be rebuilt , he scattered the people by giving them different languages -- confused them by giving them different languages .
And this leads to the wonderful irony that our languages exist to prevent us from communicating .
Even today , we know that there are words we cannot use , phrases we cannot say , because if we do so , we might be accosted , jailed , or even killed .
And all of this from a puff of air emanating from our mouths .
Now all this fuss about a single one of our traits tells us there &apos;s something worth explaining .
And that is how and why did this remarkable trait evolve , and why did it evolve only in our species ?
Now it &apos;s a little bit of a surprise that to get an answer to that question , we have to go to tool use in the chimpanzees .
Now these chimpanzees are using tools , and we take that as a sign of their intelligence .
But if they really were intelligent , why would they use a stick to extract termites from the ground rather than a shovel ?
And if they really were intelligent , why would they crack open nuts with a rock ?
Why wouldn &apos;t they just go to a shop and buy a bag of nuts that somebody else had already cracked open for them ?
Why not ? I mean , that &apos;s what we do .
Now the reason the chimpanzees don &apos;t do that is that they lack what psychologists and anthropologists call social learning .
They seem to lack the ability to learn from others by copying or imitating or simply watching .
As a result , they can &apos;t improve on others &apos; ideas or learn from others &apos; mistakes -- benefit from others &apos; wisdom .
And so they just do the same thing over and over and over again .
In fact , we could go away for a million years and come back and these chimpanzees would be doing the same thing with the same sticks for the termites and the same rocks to crack open the nuts .
Now this may sound arrogant , or even full of hubris .
How do we know this ?
Because this is exactly what our ancestors , the Homo erectus , did .
These upright apes evolved on the African savanna about two million years ago , and they made these splendid hand axes that fit wonderfully into your hands .
But if we look at the fossil record , we see that they made the same hand axe over and over and over again for one million years .
You can follow it through the fossil record .
Now if we make some guesses about how long Homo erectus lived , what their generation time was , that &apos;s about 40,000 generations of parents to offspring , and other individuals watching , in which that hand axe didn &apos;t change .
It &apos;s not even clear that our very close genetic relatives , the Neanderthals , had social learning .
Sure enough , their tools were more complicated than those of Homo erectus , but they too showed very little change over the 300,000 years or so that those species , the Neanderthals , lived in Eurasia .
Okay , so what this tells us is that , contrary to the old adage , &quot; monkey see , monkey do , &quot; the surprise really is that all of the other animals really cannot do that -- at least not very much .
And even this picture has the suspicious taint of being rigged about it -- something from a Barnum &amp; amp ; Bailey circus .
But by comparison , we can learn .
We can learn by watching other people and copying or imitating what they can do .
We can then choose , from among a range of options , the best one .
We can benefit from others &apos; ideas .
We can build on their wisdom .
And as a result , our ideas do accumulate , and our technology progresses .
And this cumulative cultural adaptation , as anthropologists call this accumulation of ideas , is responsible for everything around you in your bustling and teeming everyday lives .
I mean the world has changed out of all proportion to what we would recognize even 1,000 or 2,000 years ago .
And all of this because of cumulative cultural adaptation .
The chairs you &apos;re sitting in , the lights in this auditorium , my microphone , the iPads and iPods that you carry around with you -- all are a result of cumulative cultural adaptation .
Now to many commentators , cumulative cultural adaptation , or social learning , is job done , end of story .
Our species can make stuff , therefore we prospered in a way that no other species has .
In fact , we can even make the &quot; stuff of life &quot; -- as I just said , all the stuff around us .
But in fact , it turns out that some time around 200,000 years ago , when our species first arose and acquired social learning , that this was really the beginning of our story , not the end of our story .
Because our acquisition of social learning would create a social and evolutionary dilemma , the resolution of which , it &apos;s fair to say , would determine not only the future course of our psychology , but the future course of the entire world .
And most importantly for this , it &apos;ll tell us why we have language .
And the reason that dilemma arose is , it turns out , that social learning is visual theft .
If I can learn by watching you , I can steal your best ideas , and I can benefit from your efforts , without having to put in the time and energy that you did into developing them .
If I can watch which lure you use to catch a fish , or I can watch how you flake your hand axe to make it better , or if I follow you secretly to your mushroom patch , I can benefit from your knowledge and wisdom and skills , and maybe even catch that fish before you do .
Social learning really is visual theft .
And in any species that acquired it , it would behoove you to hide your best ideas , lest somebody steal them from you .
And so some time around 200,000 years ago , our species confronted this crisis .
And we really had only two options for dealing with the conflicts that visual theft would bring .
One of those options was that we could have retreated into small family groups .
Because then the benefits of our ideas and knowledge would flow just to our relatives .
Had we chosen this option , sometime around 200,000 years ago , we would probably still be living like the Neanderthals were when we first entered Europe 40,000 years ago .
And this is because in small groups there are fewer ideas , there are fewer innovations .
And small groups are more prone to accidents and bad luck .
So if we &apos;d chosen that path , our evolutionary path would have led into the forest -- and been a short one indeed .
The other option we could choose was to develop the systems of communication that would allow us to share ideas and to cooperate amongst others .
Choosing this option would mean that a vastly greater fund of accumulated knowledge and wisdom would become available to any one individual than would ever arise from within an individual family or an individual person on their own .
Well , we chose the second option , and language is the result .
Language evolved to solve the crisis of visual theft .
Language is a piece of social technology for enhancing the benefits of cooperation -- for reaching agreements , for striking deals and for coordinating our activities .
And you can see that , in a developing society that was beginning to acquire language , not having language would be a like a bird without wings .
Just as wings open up this sphere of air for birds to exploit , language opened up the sphere of cooperation for humans to exploit .
And we take this utterly for granted , because we &apos;re a species that is so at home with language , but you have to realize that even the simplest acts of exchange that we engage in are utterly dependent upon language .
And to see why , consider two scenarios from early in our evolution .
Let &apos;s imagine that you are really good at making arrowheads , but you &apos;re hopeless at making the wooden shafts with the flight feathers attached .
Two other people you know are very good at making the wooden shafts , but they &apos;re hopeless at making the arrowheads .
So what you do is -- one of those people has not really acquired language yet .
And let &apos;s pretend the other one is good at language skills .
So what you do one day is you take a pile of arrowheads , and you walk up to the one that can &apos;t speak very well , and you put the arrowheads down in front of him , hoping that he &apos;ll get the idea that you want to trade your arrowheads for finished arrows .
But he looks at the pile of arrowheads , thinks they &apos;re a gift , picks them up , smiles and walks off .
Now you pursue this guy , gesticulating .
A scuffle ensues and you get stabbed with one of your own arrowheads .
Okay , now replay this scene now , and you &apos;re approaching the one who has language .
You put down your arrowheads and say , &quot; I &apos;d like to trade these arrowheads for finished arrows . I &apos;ll split you 50 / 50 . &quot;
The other one says , &quot; Fine . Looks good to me .
We &apos;ll do that . &quot;
Now the job is done .
Once we have language , we can put our ideas together and cooperate to have a prosperity that we couldn &apos;t have before we acquired it .
And this is why our species has prospered around the world while the rest of the animals sit behind bars in zoos , languishing .
That &apos;s why we build space shuttles and cathedrals while the rest of the world sticks sticks into the ground to extract termites .
All right , if this view of language and its value in solving the crisis of visual theft is true , any species that acquires it should show an explosion of creativity and prosperity .
And this is exactly what the archeological record shows .
If you look at our ancestors , the Neanderthals and the Homo erectus , our immediate ancestors , they &apos;re confined to small regions of the world .
But when our species arose about 200,000 years ago , sometime after that we quickly walked out of Africa and spread around the entire world , occupying nearly every habitat on Earth .
Now whereas other species are confined to places that their genes adapt them to , with social learning and language , we could transform the environment to suit our needs .
And so we prospered in a way that no other animal has .
Language really is the most potent trait that has ever evolved .
It is the most valuable trait we have for converting new lands and resources into more people and their genes that natural selection has ever devised .
Language really is the voice of our genes .
Now having evolved language , though , we did something peculiar , even bizarre .
As we spread out around the world , we developed thousands of different languages .
Currently , there are about seven or 8,000 different languages spoken on Earth .
Now you might say , well , this is just natural .
As we diverge , our languages are naturally going to diverge .
But the real puzzle and irony is that the greatest density of different languages on Earth is found where people are most tightly packed together .
If we go to the island of Papua New Guinea , we can find about 800 to 1,000 distinct human languages , different human languages , spoken on that island alone .
There are places on that island where you can encounter a new language every two or three miles .
Now , incredible as this sounds , I once met a Papuan man , and I asked him if this could possibly be true .
And he said to me , &quot; Oh no .
They &apos;re far closer together than that . &quot;
And it &apos;s true ; there are places on that island where you can encounter a new language in under a mile .
And this is also true of some remote oceanic islands .
And so it seems that we use our language , not just to cooperate , but to draw rings around our cooperative groups and to establish identities , and perhaps to protect our knowledge and wisdom and skills from eavesdropping from outside .
And we know this because when we study different language groups and associate them with their cultures , we see that different languages slow the flow of ideas between groups .
They slow the flow of technologies .
And they even slow the flow of genes .
Now I can &apos;t speak for you , but it seems to be the case that we don &apos;t have sex with people we can &apos;t talk to .
Now we have to counter that , though , against the evidence we &apos;ve heard that we might have had some rather distasteful genetic dalliances with the Neanderthals and the Denisovans .
Okay , this tendency we have , this seemingly natural tendency we have , towards isolation , towards keeping to ourselves , crashes head first into our modern world .
This remarkable image is not a map of the world .
In fact , it &apos;s a map of Facebook friendship links .
And when you plot those friendship links by their latitude and longitude , it literally draws a map of the world .
Our modern world is communicating with itself and with each other more than it has at any time in its past .
And that communication , that connectivity around the world , that globalization now raises a burden .
Because these different languages impose a barrier , as we &apos;ve just seen , to the transfer of goods and ideas and technologies and wisdom .
And they impose a barrier to cooperation .
And nowhere do we see that more clearly than in the European Union , whose 27 member countries speak 23 official languages .
The European Union is now spending over one billion euros annually translating among their 23 official languages .
That &apos;s something on the order of 1.45 billion U.S. dollars on translation costs alone .
Now think of the absurdity of this situation .
If 27 individuals from those 27 member states sat around table , speaking their 23 languages , some very simple mathematics will tell you that you need an army of 253 translators to anticipate all the pairwise possibilities .
The European Union employs a permanent staff of about 2,500 translators .
And in 2007 alone -- and I &apos;m sure there are more recent figures -- something on the order of 1.3 million pages were translated into English alone .
And so if language really is the solution to the crisis of visual theft , if language really is the conduit of our cooperation , the technology that our species derived to promote the free flow and exchange of ideas , in our modern world , we confront a question .
And that question is whether in this modern , globalized world we can really afford to have all these different languages .
To put it this way , nature knows no other circumstance in which functionally equivalent traits coexist .
One of them always drives the other extinct .
And we see this in the inexorable march towards standardization .
There are lots and lots of ways of measuring things -- weighing them and measuring their length -- but the metric system is winning .
There are lots and lots of ways of measuring time , but a really bizarre base 60 system known as hours and minutes and seconds is nearly universal around the world .
There are many , many ways of imprinting CDs or DVDs , but those are all being standardized as well .
And you can probably think of many , many more in your own everyday lives .
And so our modern world now is confronting us with a dilemma .
And it &apos;s the dilemma that this Chinese man faces , who &apos;s language is spoken by more people in the world than any other single language , and yet he is sitting at his blackboard , converting Chinese phrases into English language phrases .
And what this does is it raises the possibility to us that in a world in which we want to promote cooperation and exchange , and in a world that might be dependent more than ever before on cooperation to maintain and enhance our levels of prosperity , his actions suggest to us it might be inevitable that we have to confront the idea that our destiny is to be one world with one language .
Thank you .
Matt Ridley : Mark , one question .
Svante found that the FOXP2 gene , which seems to be associated with language , was also shared in the same form in Neanderthals as us .
Do we have any idea how we could have defeated Neanderthals if they also had language ?
Mark Pagel : This is a very good question .
So many of you will be familiar with the idea that there &apos;s this gene called FOXP2 that seems to be implicated in some ways in the fine motor control that &apos;s associated with language .
The reason why I don &apos;t believe that tells us that the Neanderthals had language is -- here &apos;s a simple analogy : Ferraris are cars that have engines .
My car has an engine , but it &apos;s not a Ferrari .
Now the simple answer then is that genes alone don &apos;t , all by themselves , determine the outcome of very complicated things like language .
What we know about this FOXP2 and Neanderthals is that they may have had fine motor control of their mouths -- who knows .
But that doesn &apos;t tell us they necessarily had language .
MR : Thank you very much indeed .

&lt; url &gt; http : / / www.ted.com / talks / siegfried _ woldhek _ shows _ how _ he _ found _ the _ true _ face _ of _ leonardo.html &lt; / url &gt;
Good morning .
Let &apos;s look for a minute at the greatest icon of all , Leonardo da Vinci .
We &apos;re all familiar with his fantastic work -- his drawings , his paintings , his inventions , his writings .
But we do not know his face .
Thousands of books have been written about him , but there &apos;s controversy , and it remains , about his looks .
Even this well-known portrait is not accepted by many art historians .
So , what do you think ?
Is this the face of Leonardo da Vinci or isn &apos;t it ?
Let &apos;s find out .
Leonardo was a man that drew everything around him .
He drew people , anatomy , plants , animals , landscapes , buildings , water , everything .
But no faces ?
I find that hard to believe .
His contemporaries made faces , like the ones you see here -- en face or three-quarters .
So , surely a passionate drawer like Leonardo must have made self-portraits from time to time .
So let &apos;s try to find them .
I think that if we were to scan all of his work and look for self-portraits , we would find his face looking at us .
So I looked at all of his drawings , more than 700 , and looked for male portraits .
There are about 120 , you see them here .
Which ones of these could be self-portraits ?
Well , for that they have to be done as we just saw , en face or three-quarters .
So we can eliminate all the profiles .
It also has to be sufficiently detailed .
So we can also eliminate the ones that are very vague or very stylized .
And we know from his contemporaries that Leonardo was a very handsome , even beautiful man .
So we can also eliminate the ugly ones or the caricatures .
And look what happens -- only three candidates remain that fit the bill .
And here they are .
Yes , indeed , the old man is there , as is this famous pen drawing of the Homo Vitruvianus .
And lastly , the only portrait of a male that Leonardo painted , &quot; The Musician . &quot;
Before we go into these faces , I should explain why I have some right to talk about them .
I &apos;ve made more than 1,100 portraits myself for newspapers , over the course of 300 -- 30 years , sorry , 30 years only .
But there are 1,100 , and very few artists have drawn so many faces .
So I know a little about drawing and analyzing faces .
OK , now let &apos;s look at these three portraits .
And hold onto your seats , because if we zoom in on those faces , remark how they have the same broad forehead , the horizontal eyebrows , the long nose , the curved lips and the small , well-developed chin .
I couldn &apos;t believe my eyes when I first saw that .
There is no reason why these portraits should look alike .
All we did was look for portraits that had the characteristics of a self-portrait , and look , they are very similar .
Now , are they made in the right order ?
The young man should be made first .
And as you see here from the years that they were created , it is indeed the case .
They are made in the right order .
What was the age of Leonardo at the time ? Does that fit ?
Yes , it does . He was 33 , 38 and 63 when these were made .
So we have three pictures , potentially of the same person of the same age as Leonardo at the time .
But how do we know it &apos;s him , and not someone else ?
Well , we need a reference .
And here &apos;s the only picture of Leonardo that &apos;s widely accepted .
It &apos;s a statue made by Verrocchio , of David , for which Leonardo posed as a boy of 15 .
And if we now compare the face of the statue , with the face of the musician , you see the very same features again .
The statue is the reference , and it connects the identity of Leonardo to those three faces .
Ladies and gentlemen , this story has not yet been published .
It &apos;s only proper that you here at TED hear and see it first .
The icon of icons finally has a face .
Here he is : Leonardo da Vinci .

&lt; url &gt; http : / / www.ted.com / talks / robert _ lang _ folds _ way _ new _ origami.html &lt; / url &gt;
My talk is &quot; Flapping Birds and Space Telescopes . &quot;
And you would think that should have nothing to do with one another , but I hope by the end of these 18 minutes , you &apos;ll see a little bit of a relation .
It ties to origami . So let me start .
What is origami ?
Most people think they know what origami is . It &apos;s this : flapping birds , toys , cootie catchers , that sort of thing .
And that is what origami used to be .
But it &apos;s become something else .
It &apos;s become an art form , a form of sculpture .
The common theme -- what makes it origami -- is folding is how we create the form .
You know , it &apos;s very old . This is a plate from 1797 .
It shows these women playing with these toys .
If you look close , it &apos;s this shape , called a crane .
Every Japanese kid learns how to fold that crane .
So this art has been around for hundreds of years , and you would think something that &apos;s been around that long -- so restrictive , folding only -- everything that could be done has been done a long time ago .
And that might have been the case .
But in the twentieth century , a Japanese folder named Yoshizawa came along , and he created tens of thousands of new designs .
But even more importantly , he created a language , a way we could communicate , a code of dots , dashes and arrows .
Harkening back to Susan Blackmore &apos;s talk , we now have a means of transmitting information with heredity and selection , and we know where that leads .
And where it has led in origami is to things like this .
This is an origami figure -- one sheet , no cuts , folding only , hundreds of folds .
This , too , is origami , and this shows where we &apos;ve gone in the modern world .
Naturalism . Detail .
You can get horns , antlers -- even , if you look close , cloven hooves .
And it raises a question : what changed ?
And what changed is something you might not have expected in an art , which is math .
That is , people applied mathematical principles to the art , to discover the underlying laws .
And that leads to a very powerful tool .
The secret to productivity in so many fields -- and in origami -- is letting dead people do your work for you .
Because what you can do is take your problem , and turn it into a problem that someone else has solved , and use their solutions .
And I want to tell you how we did that in origami .
Origami revolves around crease patterns .
The crease pattern shown here is the underlying blueprint for an origami figure .
And you can &apos;t just draw them arbitrarily .
They have to obey four simple laws .
And they &apos;re very simple , easy to understand .
The first law is two-colorability . You can color any crease pattern with just two colors without ever having the same color meeting .
The directions of the folds at any vertex -- the number of mountain folds , the number of valley folds -- always differs by two . Two more or two less .
Nothing else .
If you look at the angles around the fold , you find that if you number the angles in a circle , all the even-numbered angles add up to a straight line , all the odd-numbered angles add up to a straight line .
And if you look at how the layers stack , you &apos;ll find that no matter how you stack folds and sheets , a sheet can never penetrate a fold .
So that &apos;s four simple laws . That &apos;s all you need in origami .
All of origami comes from that .
And you &apos;d think , &quot; Can four simple laws give rise to that kind of complexity ? &quot;
But indeed , the laws of quantum mechanics can be written down on a napkin , and yet they govern all of chemistry , all of life , all of history .
If we obey these laws , we can do amazing things .
So in origami , to obey these laws , we can take simple patterns -- like this repeating pattern of folds , called textures -- and by itself it &apos;s nothing .
But if we follow the laws of origami , we can put these patterns into another fold that itself might be something very , very simple , but when we put it together , we get something a little different .
This fish , 400 scales -- again , it is one uncut square , only folding .
And if you don &apos;t want to fold 400 scales , you can back off and just do a few things , and add plates to the back of a turtle , or toes .
Or you can ramp up and go up to 50 stars on a flag , with 13 stripes .
And if you want to go really crazy , 1,000 scales on a rattlesnake .
And this guy &apos;s on display downstairs , so take a look if you get a chance .
The most powerful tools in origami have related to how we get parts of creatures .
And I can put it in this simple equation .
We take an idea , combine it with a square , and you get an origami figure .
What matters is what we mean by those symbols .
And you might say , &quot; Can you really be that specific ?
I mean , a stag beetle -- it &apos;s got two points for jaws , it &apos;s got antennae . Can you be that specific in the detail ? &quot;
So how do we do that ? Well , we break it down into a few smaller steps .
So let me stretch out that equation .
I start with my idea . I abstract it .
What &apos;s the most abstract form ? It &apos;s a stick figure .
And from that stick figure , I somehow have to get to a folded shape that has a part for every bit of the subject , a flap for every leg .
And then once I have that folded shape that we call the base , you can make the legs narrower , you can bend them , you can turn it into the finished shape .
Now the first step , pretty easy .
Take an idea , draw a stick figure .
The last step is not so hard , but that middle step -- going from the abstract description to the folded shape -- that &apos;s hard .
But that &apos;s the place where the mathematical ideas can get us over the hump .
And I &apos;m going to show you all how to do that so you can go out of here and fold something .
But we &apos;re going to start small .
This base has a lot of flaps in it .
We &apos;re going to learn how to make one flap .
How would you make a single flap ?
Take a square . Fold it in half , fold it in half , fold it again , until it gets long and narrow , and then we &apos;ll say at the end of that , that &apos;s a flap .
I could use that for a leg , an arm , anything like that .
What paper went into that flap ?
Well , if I unfold it and go back to the crease pattern , you can see that the upper left corner of that shape is the paper that went into the flap .
So that &apos;s the flap , and all the rest of the paper &apos;s left over .
I can use it for something else .
Well , there are other ways of making a flap .
There are other dimensions for flaps .
If I make the flaps skinnier , I can use a bit less paper .
If I make the flap as skinny as possible , I get to the limit of the minimum amount of paper needed .
And you can see there , it needs a quarter-circle of paper to make a flap .
There &apos;s other ways of making flaps .
If I put the flap on the edge , it uses a half circle of paper .
And if I make the flap from the middle , it uses a full circle .
So , no matter how I make a flap , it needs some part of a circular region of paper .
So now we &apos;re ready to scale up .
What if I want to make something that has a lot of flaps ?
What do I need ? I need a lot of circles .
And in the 1990s , origami artists discovered these principles and realized we could make arbitrarily complicated figures just by packing circles .
And here &apos;s where the dead people start to help us out , because lots of people have studied the problem of packing circles .
I can rely on that vast history of mathematicians and artists looking at disc packings and arrangements .
And I can use those patterns now to create origami shapes .
So we figured out these rules whereby you pack circles , you decorate the patterns of circles with lines Those folds fold into a base . You shape the base .
You get a folded shape -- in this case , a cockroach .
And it &apos;s so simple .
It &apos;s so simple that a computer could do it .
And you say , &quot; Well , you know , how simple is that ? &quot;
But computers -- you need to be able to describe things in very basic terms , and with this , we could .
So I wrote a computer program a bunch of years ago called TreeMaker , and you can download it from my website .
It &apos;s free . It runs on all the major platforms -- even Windows .
And you just draw a stick figure , and it calculates the crease pattern .
It does the circle packing , calculates the crease pattern , and if you use that stick figure that I just showed -- which you can kind of tell , it &apos;s a deer , it &apos;s got antlers -- you &apos;ll get this crease pattern .
And if you take this crease pattern , you fold on the dotted lines , you &apos;ll get a base that you can then shape into a deer , with exactly the crease pattern that you wanted .
And if you want a different deer , you change the packing , and you can do an elk .
Or you could do a moose .
Or , really , any other kind of deer .
These techniques revolutionized this art .
We found we could do insects , spiders , which are close , things with legs , things with legs and wings , things with legs and antennae .
And if folding a single praying mantis from a single uncut square wasn &apos;t interesting enough , then you could do two praying mantises from a single uncut square .
She &apos;s eating him .
I call it &quot; Snack Time . &quot;
And you can do more than just insects .
This -- you can put details , toes and claws . A grizzly bear has claws .
This tree frog has toes .
Actually , lots of people in origami now put toes into their models .
Toes have become an origami meme , because everyone &apos;s doing it .
You can make multiple subjects .
So these are a couple of instrumentalists .
The guitar player from a single square , the bass player from a single square .
And if you say , &quot; Well , but the guitar , bass -- that &apos;s not so hot .
Do a little more complicated instrument . &quot;
Well , then you could do an organ .
And what this has allowed is the creation of origami-on-demand .
and you can go out and fold it .
And sometimes you create high art , and sometimes you pay the bills by doing some commercial work .
But I want to show you some examples .
Everything you &apos;ll see here , except the car , is origami .
Just to show you , this really was folded paper .
Computers made things move , but these were all real , folded objects that we made .
And we can use this not just for visuals , but it turns out to be useful even in the real world .
Surprisingly , origami and the structures that we &apos;ve developed in origami turn out to have applications in medicine , in science , in space , in the body , consumer electronics and more .
And I want to show you some of these examples .
One of the earliest was this pattern , this folded pattern , studied by Koryo Miura , a Japanese engineer .
He studied a folding pattern , and realized this could fold down into an extremely compact package that had a very simple opening and closing structure .
And he used it to design this solar array .
in 1995 .
Now , there is actually a little origami in the James Webb Space Telescope , but it &apos;s very simple .
The telescope , going up in space , it unfolds in two places .
It folds in thirds . It &apos;s a very simple pattern -- you wouldn &apos;t even call that origami .
They certainly didn &apos;t need to talk to origami artists .
But if you want to go higher and go larger than this , then you might need some origami .
Engineers at Lawrence Livermore National Lab had an idea for a telescope much larger .
They called it the Eyeglass .
The design called for geosynchronous orbit 25,000 miles up , 100-meter diameter lens .
So , imagine a lens the size of a football field .
There were two groups of people who were interested in this : planetary scientists , who want to look up , and then other people , who wanted to look down .
Whether you look up or look down , how do you get it up in space ? You &apos;ve got to get it up there in a rocket .
And rockets are small . So you have to make it smaller .
How do you make a large sheet of glass smaller ?
Well , about the only way is to fold it up somehow .
So you have to do something like this .
This was a small model .
Folded lens , you divide up the panels , you add flexures .
But this pattern &apos;s not going to work to get something 100 meters down to a few meters .
So the Livermore engineers , wanting to make use of the work of dead people , or perhaps live origamists , said , &quot; Let &apos;s see if someone else is doing this sort of thing . &quot;
So they looked into the origami community , we got in touch with them , and I started working with them .
And we developed a pattern together that scales to arbitrarily large size , but that allows any flat ring or disc to fold down into a very neat , compact cylinder .
And they adopted that for their first generation , which was not 100 meters -- it was a five-meter .
But this is a five-meter telescope -- has about a quarter-mile focal length .
And it works perfectly on its test range , and it indeed folds up into a neat little bundle .
Now , there is other origami in space .
Japan Aerospace &#91; Exploration &#93; Agency flew a solar sail , and you can see here that the sail expands out , and you can still see the fold lines .
The problem that &apos;s being solved here is something that needs to be big and sheet-like at its destination , but needs to be small for the journey .
And that works whether you &apos;re going into space , or whether you &apos;re just going into a body .
And this example is the latter .
This is a heart stent developed by Zhong You at Oxford University .
It holds open a blocked artery when it gets to its destination , but it needs to be much smaller for the trip there , through your blood vessels .
And this stent folds down using an origami pattern , based on a model called the water bomb base .
Airbag designers also have the problem of getting flat sheets into a small space .
And they want to do their design by simulation .
So they need to figure out how , in a computer , to flatten an airbag .
And the algorithms that we developed to do insects turned out to be the solution for airbags to do their simulation .
And so they can do a simulation like this .
Those are the origami creases forming , and now you can see the airbag inflate and find out , does it work ?
And that leads to a really interesting idea .
You know , where did these things come from ?
Well , the heart stent came from that little blow-up box that you might have learned in elementary school .
It &apos;s the same pattern , called the water bomb base .
The airbag-flattening algorithm came from all the developments of circle packing and the mathematical theory that was really developed just to create insects -- things with legs .
The thing is , that this often happens in math and science .
When you get math involved , problems that you solve for aesthetic value only , or to create something beautiful , turn around and turn out to have an application in the real world .
And as weird and surprising as it may sound , origami may someday even save a life .
Thanks .

For me they normally happen , these career crises , often , actually , on a Sunday evening , just as the sun is starting to set , and the gap between my hopes for myself , and the reality of my life , start to diverge so painfully that I normally end up weeping into a pillow .
I &apos;m mentioning all this , I &apos;m mentioning all this because I think this is not merely a personal problem .
You may think I &apos;m wrong in this , but I think that we live in an age when our lives are regularly punctuated by career crises , by moments when what we thought we knew , about our lives , about our careers , comes into contact with a threatening sort of reality .
It &apos;s perhaps easier now than ever before to make a good living .
It &apos;s perhaps harder than ever before to stay calm , to be free of career anxiety .
I want to look now , if I may , at some of the reasons why we might be feeling anxiety about our careers .
Why we might be victims of these career crises , as we &apos;re weeping softly into our pillows .
One of the reasons why we might be suffering is that we are surrounded by snobs .
In a way , I &apos;ve got some bad news , particularly to anybody who &apos;s come to Oxford from abroad .
There is a real problem with snobbery .
Because sometimes people from outside the U.K.
imagine that snobbery is a distinctively U.K. phenomenon fixated on country houses and titles .
The bad news is that &apos;s not true .
Snobbery is a global phenomenon .
We are a global organization . This is a global phenomenon .
It exists . What is a snob ?
A snob is anybody who takes a small part of you and uses that to come to a complete vision of who you are .
That is snobbery .
The dominant kind of snobbery that exists nowadays is job snobbery .
You encounter it within minutes at a party , when you get asked that famous iconic question of the early 21st century , &quot; What do you do ? &quot;
And according to how you answer that question , people are either incredibly delighted to see you , or look at their watch and make their excuses .
Now , the opposite of a snob is your mother .
Not necessarily your mother , or indeed mine , but , as it were , the ideal mother , somebody who doesn &apos;t care about your achievements .
But unfortunately , most people are not our mothers .
Most people make a strict correlation between how much time , and if you like , love -- not romantic love , though that may be something -- but love in general , respect , they are willing to accord us , that will be strictly defined by our position in the social hierarchy .
And that &apos;s a lot of the reason why we care so much about our careers and indeed start caring so much about material goods .
You know , we &apos;re often told that we live in very materialistic times , that we &apos;re all greedy people .
I don &apos;t think we are particularly materialistic .
I think we live in a society which has simply pegged certain emotional rewards to the acquisition of material goods .
It &apos;s not the material goods we want . It &apos;s the rewards we want .
And that &apos;s a new way of looking at luxury goods .
The next time you see somebody driving a Ferrari don &apos;t think , &quot; This is somebody who is greedy . &quot;
Think , &quot; This is somebody who is incredibly vulnerable and in need of love . &quot;
In other words -- feel sympathy , rather than contempt .
There are other reasons -- there are other reasons why it &apos;s perhaps harder now to feel calm than ever before .
One of these , and it &apos;s paradoxical because it &apos;s linked to something that &apos;s rather nice , is the hope we all have for our careers .
Never before have expectations been so high about what human beings can achieve with their lifespan .
We &apos;re told , from many sources , that anyone can achieve anything .
We &apos;ve done away with the caste system .
We are now in a system where anyone can rise to any position they please .
And it &apos;s a beautiful idea .
Along with that is a kind of spirit of equality . We &apos;re all basically equal .
There are no strictly defined kind of hierarchies .
There is one really big problem with this , and that problem is envy .
Envy , it &apos;s a real taboo to mention envy , but if there is one dominant emotion in modern society , that is envy .
And it &apos;s linked to the spirit of equality . Let me explain .
I think it would be very unusual for anyone here , or anyone watching , to be envious of the Queen of England .
Even though she is much richer than any of you are .
And she &apos;s got a very large house .
The reason why we don &apos;t envy her is because she &apos;s too weird .
She &apos;s simply too strange .
We can &apos;t relate to her . She speaks in a funny way .
She comes from an odd place .
So we can &apos;t relate to her . And when you can &apos;t relate to somebody , you don &apos;t envy them .
The closer two people are , in age , in background , in the process of identification , the more there is a danger of envy -- which is incidentally why none of you should ever go to a school reunion -- because there is no stronger reference point than people one was at school with .
But the problem , generally , of modern society , is that it turns the whole world into a school . Everybody is wearing jeans , everybody is the same .
And yet , they &apos;re not .
So there is a spirit of equality , combined with deep inequalities .
Which makes for a very -- can make for a very stressful situation .
It &apos;s probably as unlikely that you would nowadays become as rich and famous as Bill Gates , as it was unlikely in the 17th century that you would accede to the ranks of the French aristocracy .
But the point is , it doesn &apos;t feel that way .
It &apos;s made to feel , by magazines and other media outlets , that if you &apos;ve got energy , a few bright ideas about technology , a garage , you too could start a major thing .
And the consequences of this problem make themselves felt in bookshops .
When you go to a large bookshop and look at the self-help sections , as I sometimes do , if you analyze self-help books that are produced in the world today , there are basically two kinds .
The first kind tells you , &quot; You can do it ! You can make it ! Anything is possible ! &quot;
And the other kind tells you how to cope with what we politely call &quot; low self-esteem , &quot; or impolitely call &quot; feeling very bad about yourself . &quot;
There is a real correlationship , a real correlation between a society that tells people that they can do anything and the existence of low self-esteem .
So that &apos;s another way in which something that is quite positive can have a nasty kickback .
There is another reason why we might be feeling more anxious , about our careers , about our status in the world today , than ever before .
And it is , again , linked to something nice , and that nice thing is called meritocracy .
Everybody , all politicians on Left and Right , agree that meritocracy is a great thing , and we should all be trying to make our societies really , really meritocratic .
In other words , what is a meritocratic society ?
A meritocratic society is one in which if you &apos;ve got talent and energy and skill , you will get to the top . Nothing should hold you back .
It &apos;s a beautiful idea . The problem is if you really believe in a society where those who merit to get to the top , get to the top , you &apos;ll also , by implication , and in a far more nasty way , believe in a society where those who deserve to get to the bottom also get to the bottom and stay there .
In other words , your position in life comes to seem not accidental , but merited and deserved .
And that makes failure seem much more crushing .
You know , in the Middle Ages , in England , when you met a very poor person , that person would be described as an &quot; unfortunate &quot; -- literally , somebody who had not been blessed by fortune , an unfortunate .
Nowadays , particularly in the United States , if you meet someone at the bottom of society , they may unkindly be described as a &quot; loser . &quot;
There is a real difference between an unfortunate and a loser , and that shows 400 years of evolution in society and our belief in who is responsible for our lives .
It &apos;s no longer the gods , it &apos;s us . We &apos;re in the driving seat .
That &apos;s exhilarating if you &apos;re doing well , and very crushing if you &apos;re not .
It leads , in the worst cases , in the analysis of a sociologist like Emil Durkheim , it leads to increased rates of suicide .
There are more suicides in developed individualistic countries than in any other part of the world .
And some of the reason for that is that people take what happens to them extremely personally .
They own their success . But they also own their failure .
Is there any relief from some of these pressures that I &apos;ve just been outlining ?
I think there is . I just want to turn to a few of them .
Let &apos;s take meritocracy .
This idea that everybody deserves to get where they get to , I think it &apos;s a crazy idea , completely crazy .
I will support any politician of Left and Right , with any halfway decent meritocratic idea .
I am a meritocrat in that sense .
But I think it &apos;s insane to believe that we will ever make a society that is genuinely meritocratic . It &apos;s an impossible dream .
The idea that we will make a society where literally everybody is graded , the good at the top , and the bad at the bottom , and it &apos;s exactly done as it should be , is impossible .
There are simply too many random factors : accidents , accidents of birth , accidents of things dropping on people &apos;s heads , illnesses , etc .
We will never get to grade them , never get to grade people as they should .
I &apos;m drawn to a lovely quote by St. Augustine in &quot; The City of God , &quot; where he says , &quot; It &apos;s a sin to judge any man by his post . &quot;
In modern English that would mean it &apos;s a sin to come to any view of who you should talk to dependent on their business card .
It &apos;s not the post that should count .
According to St. Augustine , it &apos;s only God who can really put everybody in their place .
And he &apos;s going to do that on the Day of Judgment with angels and trumpets , and the skies will open .
Insane idea , if you &apos;re a secularist person , like me .
But something very valuable in that idea , nevertheless .
In other words , hold your horses when you &apos;re coming to judge people .
You don &apos;t necessarily know what someone &apos;s true value is .
That is an unknown part of them .
And we shouldn &apos;t behave as though it is known .
There is another source of solace and comfort for all this .
When we think about failing in life , when we think about failure , one of the reasons why we fear failing is not just a loss of income , a loss of status .
What we fear is the judgment and ridicule of others . And it exists .
You know , the number one organ of ridicule nowadays , is the newspaper .
And if you open the newspaper any day of the week , it &apos;s full of people who &apos;ve messed up their lives .
They &apos;ve slept with the wrong person . They &apos;ve taken the wrong substance .
They &apos;ve passed the wrong piece of legislation . Whatever it is .
And then are fit for ridicule .
In other words , they have failed . And they are described as &quot; losers . &quot;
Now is there any alternative to this ?
I think the Western tradition shows us one glorious alternative , and that is tragedy .
Tragic art , as it developed in the theaters of ancient Greece , in the fifth century B.C. , was essentially an art form devoted to tracing how people fail , and also according them a level of sympathy , which ordinary life would not necessarily accord them .
I remember a few years ago , I was thinking about all this , and I went to see &quot; The Sunday Sport , &quot; a tabloid newspaper that I don &apos;t recommend you to start reading if you &apos;re not familiar with it already .
I went to talk to them about certain of the great tragedies of Western art .
I wanted to see how they would seize the bare bones of certain stories if they came in as a news item at the news desk on a Saturday afternoon .
So I told them about Othello . They had not heard of it but were fascinated by it .
And I asked them to write the headline for the story of Othello .
They came up with &quot; Love-Crazed Immigrant Kills Senator &apos;s Daughter &quot; splashed across the headline .
I gave them the plotline of Madame Bovary .
Again , a book they were enchanted to discover .
And they wrote &quot; Shopaholic Adulteress Swallows Arsenic After Credit Fraud . &quot;
And then my favorite .
They really do have a kind of genius all of their own , these guys .
My favorite is Sophocles &apos; Oedipus the King : &quot; Sex With Mum Was Blinding &quot; In a way , if you like , at one end of the spectrum of sympathy , you &apos;ve got the tabloid newspaper .
At the other end of the spectrum you &apos;ve got tragedy and tragic art , and I suppose I &apos;m arguing that we should learn a little bit about what &apos;s happening in tragic art .
It would be insane to call Hamlet a loser .
He is not a loser , though he has lost .
And I think that is the message of tragedy to us , and why it &apos;s so very , very important , I think .
The other thing about modern society and why it causes this anxiety is that we have nothing at its center that is non-human .
We are the first society to be living in a world where we don &apos;t worship anything other than ourselves .
We think very highly of ourselves , and so we should .
We &apos;ve put people on the moon . We &apos;ve done all sorts of extraordinary things .
And so we tend to worship ourselves .
Our heroes are human heroes .
That &apos;s a very new situation .
Most other societies have had , right at their center , the worship of something transcendent : a god , a spirit , a natural force , the universe , whatever it is , something else that is being worshiped .
We &apos;ve slightly lost the habit of doing that , which is , I think , why we &apos;re particularly drawn to nature .
Not for the sake of our health , though it &apos;s often presented that way , but because it &apos;s an escape from the human anthill .
It &apos;s an escape from our own competition , and our own dramas .
And that &apos;s why we enjoy looking at glaciers and oceans , and contemplating the Earth from outside its perimeters , etc .
We like to feel in contact with something that is non-human , and that is so deeply important to us .
What I think I &apos;ve been talking about really is success and failure .
And one of the interesting things about success is that we think we know what it means .
If I said to you that there is somebody behind the screen who is very very successful , certain ideas would immediately come to mind .
You would think that person might have made a lot of money , achieved renown in some field .
My own theory of success -- and I &apos;m somebody who is very interested in success . I really want to be successful .
I &apos;m always thinking , &quot; How could I be more successful ? &quot;
But as I get older , I &apos;m also very nuanced about what that word &quot; success &quot; might mean .
Here &apos;s an insight that I &apos;ve had about success .
You can &apos;t be successful at everything .
We hear a lot of talk about work-life balance .
Nonsense . You can &apos;t have it all . You can &apos;t .
So any vision of success has to admit what it &apos;s losing out on , where the element of loss is .
I think any wise life will accept , as I say , that there is going to be an element where we are not succeeding .
Thing about a successful life is , a lot of the time , our ideas of what it would mean to live successfully are not our own .
They are sucked in from other people : chiefly , if you &apos;re a man , your father , and if you &apos;re a woman , your mother .
Psychoanalysis has been drumming home this message for about 80 years .
No one is quite listening hard enough , but I very much believe that that &apos;s true .
And we also suck in messages from everything from the television , to advertising , to marketing , etc .
These are hugely powerful forces that define what we want and how we view ourselves .
When we &apos;re told that banking is a very respectable profession a lot of us want to go into banking .
When banking is no longer so respectable , we lose interest in banking .
We are highly open to suggestion .
So what I want to argue for is not that we should give up on our ideas of success , but we should make sure that they are our own .
We should focus in on our ideas .
and make sure that we own them , that we are truly the authors of our own ambitions .
Because it &apos;s bad enough , not getting what you want , but it &apos;s even worse to have an idea of what it is you want and find out at the end of a journey , that it isn &apos;t , in fact , what you wanted all along .
So I &apos;m going to end it there .
But what I really want to stress is by all means , success , yes .
But let &apos;s accept the strangeness of some of our ideas .
Let &apos;s probe away at our notions of success .
Let &apos;s make sure our ideas of success are truly our own .
Thank you very much .
That was fascinating . How do you reconcile this idea of someone being -- it being bad to think of someone as a loser with the idea , that a lot of people like , of seizing control of your life .
And that a society that encourages that perhaps has to have some winners and losers .
Alain de Botton : Yes . I think it &apos;s merely the randomness of the winning and losing process that I wanted to stress .
Because the emphasis nowadays is so much on the justice of everything , and politicians always talk about justice .
Now I am a firm believer in justice , I just think that it is impossible .
So we should do everything we can , we should do everything we can to pursue it .
But at the end of the day we should always remember that whoever is facing us , whatever has happened in their lives , there will be a strong element of the haphazard .
And it &apos;s that that I &apos;m trying to leave room for .
Because otherwise it can get quite claustrophobic .
I mean , do you believe that you can combine your kind of kinder , gentler philosophy of work with a successful economy ?
Or do you think that you can &apos;t ?
But it doesn &apos;t matter that much that we &apos;re putting too much emphasis on that ?
The nightmare thought is that frightening people is the best way to get work out of them , and that somehow the crueler the environment the more people will rise to the challenge .
You want to think , who would you like as your ideal dad ?
And your ideal dad is somebody who is tough but gentle .
And it &apos;s a very hard line to make .
We need fathers , as it were , the exemplary father figures in society , avoiding the two extremes , which is the authoritarian , disciplinarian , on the one hand , and on the other , the lax , no rules option .
Alain de Botton .
Thank you very much .

I was only four years old when I saw my mother load a washing machine for the very first time in her life .
That was a great day for my mother .
My mother and father had been saving money for years to be able to buy that machine , and the first day it was going to be used , even Grandma was invited to see the machine .
And Grandma was even more excited .
Throughout her life she had been heating water with firewood , and she had hand washed laundry for seven children .
And now she was going to watch electricity do that work .
My mother carefully opened the door , and she loaded the laundry into the machine , like this .
And then , when she closed the door , Grandma said , &quot; No , no , no , no .
Let me , let me push the button . &quot;
And Grandma pushed the button , and she said , &quot; Oh , fantastic !
I want to see this ! Give me a chair !
Give me a chair ! I want to see it , &quot; and she sat down in front of the machine , and she watched the entire washing program .
She was mesmerized .
To my grandmother , the washing machine was a miracle .
Today , in Sweden and other rich countries , people are using so many different machines .
Look , the homes are full of machines .
I can &apos;t even name them all .
And they also , when they want to travel , they use flying machines that can take them to remote destinations .
And yet , in the world , there are so many people who still heat the water on fire , and they cook their food on fire .
Sometimes they don &apos;t even have enough food , and they live below the poverty line .
There are two billion fellow human beings who live on less than two dollars a day .
And the richest people over there -- there &apos;s one billion people -- and they live above what I call the &quot; air line , &quot; because they spend more than $ 80 a day on their consumption .
But this is just one , two , three billion people , and obviously there are seven billion people in the world , so there must be one , two , three , four billion people more who live in between the poverty and the air line .
They have electricity , but the question is , how many have washing machines ?
I &apos;ve done the scrutiny of market data , and I &apos;ve found that , indeed , the washing machine has penetrated below the air line , and today there &apos;s an additional one billion people out there who live above the &quot; wash line . &quot;
And they consume more than $ 40 per day .
So two billion have access to washing machines .
And the remaining five billion , how do they wash ?
Or , to be more precise , how do most of the women in the world wash ?
Because it remains hard work for women to wash .
They wash like this : by hand .
It &apos;s a hard , time-consuming labor , which they have to do for hours every week .
And sometimes they also have to bring water from far away to do the laundry at home , or they have to bring the laundry away to a stream far off .
And they want the washing machine .
They don &apos;t want to spend such a large part of their life doing this hard work with so relatively low productivity .
And there &apos;s nothing different in their wish than it was for my grandma .
Look here , two generations ago in Sweden -- picking water from the stream , heating with firewood and washing like that .
They want the washing machine in exactly the same way .
But when I lecture to environmentally-concerned students , they tell me , &quot; No , everybody in the world cannot have cars and washing machines . &quot;
How can we tell this woman that she ain &apos;t going to have a washing machine ?
And then I ask my students , I &apos;ve asked them -- over the last two years I &apos;ve asked , &quot; How many of you doesn &apos;t use a car ? &quot;
And some of them proudly raise their hand and say , &quot; I don &apos;t use a car . &quot;
And then I put the really tough question : &quot; How many of you hand-wash your jeans and your bed sheets ? &quot;
And no one raised their hand .
Even the hardcore in the green movement use washing machines .
So how come &#91; this is &#93; something that everyone uses and they think others will not stop it ? What is special with this ?
I had to do an analysis about the energy used in the world .
Here we are .
Look here , you see the seven billion people up there : the air people , the wash people , the bulb people and the fire people .
One unit like this is an energy unit of fossil fuel -- oil , coal or gas .
That &apos;s what most of electricity and the energy in the world is .
And it &apos;s 12 units used in the entire world , and the richest one billion , they use six of them .
Half of the energy is used by one seventh of the world &apos;s population .
And these ones who have washing machines , but not a house full of other machines , they use two .
This group uses three , one each .
And they also have electricity .
And over there they don &apos;t even use one each .
That makes 12 of them .
But the main concern for the environmentally-interested students -- and they are right -- is about the future .
What are the trends ? If we just prolong the trends , without any real advanced analysis , to 2050 , there are two things that can increase the energy use .
First , population growth .
Second , economic growth .
Population growth will mainly occur among the poorest people here because they have high child mortality and they have many children per woman .
And &#91; with &#93; that you will get two extra , but that won &apos;t change the energy use very much .
What will happen is economic growth .
The best of here in the emerging economies -- I call them the New East -- they will jump the air line .
&quot; Wopp ! &quot; they will say .
And they will start to use as much as the Old West are doing already .
And these people , they want the washing machine .
I told you . They &apos;ll go there .
And they will double their energy use .
And we hope that the poor people will get into the electric light .
And they &apos;ll get a two-child family without a stop in population growth .
But the total energy consumption will increase to 22 units .
And these 22 units -- still the richest people use most of it .
So what needs to be done ?
Because the risk , the high probability of climate change is real .
It &apos;s real .
Of course they must be more energy-efficient .
They must change behavior in some way .
They must also start to produce green energy , much more green energy .
But until they have the same energy consumption per person , they shouldn &apos;t give advice to others -- what to do and what not to do .
Here we can get more green energy all over .
This is what we hope may happen .
It &apos;s a real challenge in the future .
But I can assure you that this woman in the favela in Rio , she wants a washing machine .
She &apos;s very happy about her minister of energy that provided electricity to everyone -- so happy that she even voted for her .
And she became Dilma Rousseff , the president-elect of one of the biggest democracies in the world -- moving from minister of energy to president .
If you have democracy , people will vote for washing machines .
They love them .
And what &apos;s the magic with them ?
My mother explained the magic with this machine the very , very first day .
She said , &quot; Now Hans , we have loaded the laundry .
The machine will make the work .
And now we can go to the library . &quot;
Because this is the magic : you load the laundry , and what do you get out of the machine ?
You get books out of the machines , children &apos;s books .
And mother got time to read for me .
She loved this . I got the &quot; ABC &apos;s &quot; -- this is where I started my career as a professor , when my mother had time to read for me .
And she also got books for herself .
She managed to study English and learn that as a foreign language .
And she read so many novels , so many different novels here .
And we really , we really loved this machine .
And what we said , my mother and me , &quot; Thank you industrialization .
Thank you steel mill .
Thank you power station .
And thank you chemical processing industry that gave us time to read books . &quot;
Thank you very much .

&lt; url &gt; http : / / www.ted.com / talks / jessa _ gamble _ how _ to _ sleep.html &lt; / url &gt;
Let &apos;s start with day and night .
Life evolved under conditions of light and darkness , light and then darkness .
And so plants and animals developed their own internal clocks so that they would be ready for these changes in light .
These are chemical clocks , and they &apos;re found in every known being that has two or more cells and in some that only have one cell .
I &apos;ll give you an example -- if you take a horseshoe crab off the beach , and you fly it all the way across the continent , and you drop it into a sloped cage , it will scramble up the floor of the cage as the tide is rising on its home shores , and it &apos;ll skitter down again right as the water is receding thousands of miles away .
It &apos;ll do this for weeks , until it kind of gradually loses the plot .
And it &apos;s incredible to watch , but there &apos;s nothing psychic or paranormal going on ; it &apos;s simply that these crabs have internal cycles that correspond , usually , with what &apos;s going on around it .
So , we have this ability as well .
And in humans , we call it the &quot; body clock . &quot;
You can see this most clearly when you take away someone &apos;s watch and you shut them into a bunker , deep underground , for a couple of months .
People actually volunteer for this , and they usually come out kind of raving about their productive time in the hole .
So , no matter how atypical these subjects would have to be , they all show the same thing .
They get up just a little bit later every day -- say 15 minutes or so -- and they kind of drift all the way around the clock like this over the course of the weeks .
And so , in this way we know that they are working on their own internal clocks , rather than somehow sensing the day outside .
So fine , we have a body clock , and it turns out that it &apos;s incredibly important in our lives .
It &apos;s a huge driver for culture and I think that it &apos;s the most underrated force on our behavior .
We evolved as a species near the equator , and so we &apos;re very well-equipped to deal with 12 hours of daylight and 12 hours of darkness .
But of course , we &apos;ve spread to every corner of the globe and in Arctic Canada , where I live , we have perpetual daylight in summer and 24 hours of darkness in winter .
So the culture , the northern aboriginal culture , traditionally has been highly seasonal .
In winter , there &apos;s a lot of sleeping going on ; you enjoy your family life inside .
And in summer , it &apos;s almost manic hunting and working activity very long hours , very active .
So , what would our natural rhythm look like ?
What would our sleeping patterns be in the sort of ideal sense ?
Well , it turns out that when people are living without any sort of artificial light at all , they sleep twice every night .
They go to bed around 8 : 00 p.m.
until midnight and then again , they sleep from about 2 : 00 a.m. until sunrise .
And in-between , they have a couple of hours of sort of meditative quiet in bed .
And during this time , there &apos;s a surge of prolactin , the likes of which a modern day never sees .
The people in these studies report feeling so awake during the daytime , that they realize they &apos;re experiencing true wakefulness for the first time in their lives .
So , cut to the modern day .
We &apos;re living in a culture of jet lag , global travel , 24-hour business , shift work .
And you know , our modern ways of doing things have their advantages , but I believe we should understand the costs .
Thank you .

Now , have any of y &apos;all ever looked up this word ?
You know , in a dictionary ? Yeah , that &apos;s what I thought .
How about this word ?
Here , I &apos;ll show it to you .
Lexicography : the practice of compiling dictionaries .
Notice -- we &apos;re very specific -- that word &quot; compile . &quot;
The dictionary is not carved out of a piece of granite , out of a lump of rock . It &apos;s made up of lots of little bits .
It &apos;s little discrete -- that &apos;s spelled D-I-S-C-R-E-T-E -- bits .
And those bits are words .
Now one of the perks of being a lexicographer -- besides getting to come to TED -- is that you get to say really fun words , like lexicographical .
Lexicographical has this great pattern : it &apos;s called a double dactyl . And just by saying double dactyl , I &apos;ve sent the geek needle all the way into the red .
But &quot; lexicographical &quot; is the same pattern as &quot; higgledy-piggledy . &quot;
Right ? It &apos;s a fun word to say , and I get to say it a lot .
Now , one of the non-perks of being a lexicographer is that people don &apos;t usually have a kind of warm , fuzzy , snuggly image of the dictionary .
Right ? Nobody hugs their dictionaries .
But what people really often think about the dictionary is , they think more like this .
Just to let you know , I do not have a lexicographical whistle .
But people think that my job is to let the good words make that difficult left-hand turn into the dictionary , and keep the bad words out .
But the thing is , I don &apos;t want to be a traffic cop .
For one thing , I just do not do uniforms .
And for another , deciding what words are good and what words are bad is actually not very easy .
And it &apos;s not very fun . And when parts of your job are not easy or fun , you kind of look for an excuse not to do them .
So if I had to think of some kind of occupation as a metaphor for my work , I would much rather be a fisherman .
I want to throw my big net into the deep , blue ocean of English and see what marvelous creatures I can drag up from the bottom .
But why do people want me to direct traffic , when I would much rather go fishing ?
Well , I blame the Queen .
Why do I blame the Queen ?
Well , first of all , I blame the Queen because it &apos;s funny .
But secondly , I blame the Queen because dictionaries have really not changed .
Our idea of what a dictionary is has not changed since her reign .
The only thing that Queen Victoria would not be amused by in modern dictionaries is our inclusion of the F-word , which has happened in American dictionaries since 1965 .
So , there &apos;s this guy , right ? Victorian era .
James Murray , first editor of the Oxford English Dictionary .
I do not have that hat . I wish I had that hat .
So he &apos;s really responsible for a lot of what we consider modern in dictionaries today .
When a guy who looks like that , in that hat , is the face of modernity , you have a problem .
And so , James Murray could get a job on any dictionary today .
There &apos;d be virtually no learning curve .
And of course , a few of us are saying : okay , computers !
Computers ! What about computers ?
The thing about computers is , I love computers .
I mean , I &apos;m a huge geek , I love computers .
I would go on a hunger strike before I let them take away Google Book Search from me .
But computers don &apos;t do much else other than speed up the process of compiling dictionaries .
They don &apos;t change the end result .
Because what a dictionary is , is it &apos;s Victorian design merged with a little bit of modern propulsion .
It &apos;s steampunk . What we have is an electric velocipede .
You know , we have Victorian design with an engine on it . That &apos;s all !
The design has not changed .
And OK , what about online dictionaries , right ?
Online dictionaries must be different .
This is the Oxford English Dictionary Online , one of the best online dictionaries .
This is my favorite word , by the way .
Erinaceous : pertaining to the hedgehog family ; of the nature of a hedgehog .
Very useful word . So , look at that .
Online dictionaries right now are paper thrown up on a screen .
This is flat . Look how many links there are in the actual entry : two !
Right ? Those little buttons , I had them all expanded except for the date chart .
So there &apos;s not very much going on here .
There &apos;s not a lot of clickiness .
And in fact , online dictionaries replicate almost all the problems of print , except for searchability .
And when you improve searchability , you actually take away the one advantage of print , which is serendipity .
Serendipity is when you find things you weren &apos;t looking for , because finding what you are looking for is so damned difficult .
So -- -- now , when you think about this , what we have here is a ham butt problem .
Does everyone know the ham butt problem ?
Woman &apos;s making a ham for a big , family dinner .
She goes to cut the butt off the ham and throw it away , and she looks at this piece of ham and she &apos;s like , &quot; This is a perfectly good piece of ham . Why am I throwing this away ? &quot;
She thought , &quot; Well , my mom always did this . &quot;
So she calls up mom , and she says , &quot; Mom , why &apos;d you cut the butt off the ham , when you &apos;re making a ham ? &quot;
She says , &quot; I don &apos;t know , my mom always did it ! &quot;
So they call grandma , and grandma says , &quot; My pan was too small ! &quot;
So , it &apos;s not that we have good words and bad words .
We have a pan that &apos;s too small !
You know , that ham butt is delicious ! There &apos;s no reason to throw it away .
The bad words -- see , when people think about a place and they don &apos;t find a place on the map , they think , &quot; This map sucks ! &quot;
When they find a nightspot or a bar , and it &apos;s not in the guidebook , they &apos;re like , &quot; Ooh , this place must be cool ! It &apos;s not in the guidebook . &quot;
When they find a word that &apos;s not in the dictionary , they think , &quot; This must be a bad word . &quot; Why ? It &apos;s more likely to be a bad dictionary .
Why are you blaming the ham for being too big for the pan ?
So , you can &apos;t get a smaller ham .
The English language is as big as it is .
So , if you have a ham butt problem , and you &apos;re thinking about the ham butt problem , the conclusion that it leads you to is inexorable and counterintuitive : paper is the enemy of words .
How can this be ? I mean , I love books . I really love books .
Some of my best friends are books .
But the book is not the best shape for the dictionary .
Now they &apos;re going to think &quot; Oh , boy .
People are going to take away my beautiful , paper dictionaries ? &quot;
No . There will still be paper dictionaries .
When we had cars -- when cars became the dominant mode of transportation , we didn &apos;t round up all the horses and shoot them .
You know , there &apos;re still going to be paper dictionaries , but it &apos;s not going to be the dominant dictionary .
The book-shaped dictionary is not going to be the only shape dictionaries come in . And it &apos;s not going to be the prototype for the shapes dictionaries come in .
So , think about it this way : if you &apos;ve got an artificial constraint , artificial constraints lead to arbitrary distinctions and a skewed worldview .
What if biologists could only study animals that made people go , &quot; Aww . &quot; Right ?
What if we made aesthetic judgments about animals , and only the ones we thought were cute were the ones that we could study ?
We &apos;d know a whole lot about charismatic megafauna , and not very much about much else .
And I think this is a problem .
I think we should study all the words , because when you think about words , you can make beautiful expressions from very humble parts .
Lexicography is really more about material science .
We are studying the tolerances of the materials that you use to build the structure of your expression : your speeches and your writing . And then , often people say to me , &quot; Well , OK , how do I know that this word is real ? &quot;
They think , &quot; OK , if we think words are the tools that we use to build the expressions of our thoughts , how can you say that screwdrivers are better than hammers ?
How can you say that a sledgehammer is better than a ball-peen hammer ? &quot;
They &apos;re just the right tools for the job .
And so people say to me , &quot; How do I know if a word is real ? &quot;
You know , anybody who &apos;s read a children &apos;s book knows that love makes things real .
If you love a word , use it . That makes it real .
Being in the dictionary is an artificial distinction .
It doesn &apos;t make a word any more real than any other way .
If you love a word , it becomes real .
So if we &apos;re not worrying about directing traffic , if we &apos;ve transcended paper , if we are worrying less about control and more about description , then we can think of the English language as being this beautiful mobile .
And any time one of those little parts of the mobile changes , is touched , any time you touch a word , you use it in a new context , you give it a new connotation , you verb it , you make the mobile move .
You didn &apos;t break it . It &apos;s just in a new position , and that new position can be just as beautiful .
Now , if you &apos;re no longer a traffic cop -- the problem with being a traffic cop is there can only be so many traffic cops in any one intersection , or the cars get confused . Right ?
But if your goal is no longer to direct the traffic , but maybe to count the cars that go by , then more eyeballs are better .
You can ask for help !
If you ask for help , you get more done . And we really need help .
Library of Congress : 17 million books , of which half are in English .
If only one out of every 10 of those books had a word that &apos;s not in the dictionary in it , that would be equivalent to more than two unabridged dictionaries .
And I find an un-dictionaried word -- a word like &quot; un-dictionaried , &quot; for example -- in almost every book I read . What about newspapers ?
Newspaper archive goes back to 1759 , 58.1 million newspaper pages . If only one in 100 of those pages had an un-dictionaried word on it , it would be an entire other OED .
That &apos;s 500,000 more words . So that &apos;s a lot .
And I &apos;m not even talking about magazines . I &apos;m not talking about blogs -- and I find more new words on BoingBoing in a given week than I do Newsweek or Time .
There &apos;s a lot going on there .
And I &apos;m not even talking about polysemy , which is the greedy habit some words have of taking more than one meaning for themselves .
So if you think of the word &quot; set , &quot; a set can be a badger &apos;s burrow , a set can be one of the pleats in an Elizabethan ruff , and there &apos;s one numbered definition in the OED .
The OED has 33 different numbered definitions for set .
Tiny , little word , 33 numbered definitions .
One of them is just labeled &quot; miscellaneous technical senses . &quot;
Do you know what that says to me ?
That says to me , it was Friday afternoon and somebody wanted to go down the pub .
That &apos;s a lexicographical cop out , to say , &quot; miscellaneous technical senses . &quot;
So , we have all these words , and we really need help !
And the thing is , we could ask for help -- asking for help &apos;s not that hard .
I mean , lexicography is not rocket science .
See , I just gave you a lot of words and a lot of numbers , and this is more of a visual explanation .
If we think of the dictionary as being the map of the English language , these bright spots are what we know about , and the dark spots are where we are in the dark .
If that was the map of all the words in American English , we don &apos;t know very much .
And we don &apos;t even know the shape of the language .
If this was the dictionary -- if this was the map of American English -- look , we have a kind of lumpy idea of Florida , but there &apos;s no California !
We &apos;re missing California from American English .
We just don &apos;t know enough , and we don &apos;t even know that we &apos;re missing California .
We don &apos;t even see that there &apos;s a gap on the map .
So again , lexicography is not rocket science .
But even if it were , rocket science is being done by dedicated amateurs these days . You know ?
It can &apos;t be that hard to find some words !
So , enough scientists in other disciplines are really asking people to help , and they &apos;re doing a good job of it .
For instance , there &apos;s eBird , where amateur birdwatchers can upload information about their bird sightings .
And then , ornithologists can go and help track populations , migrations , etc .
And there &apos;s this guy , Mike Oates . Mike Oates lives in the U.K.
He &apos;s a director of an electroplating company .
He &apos;s found more than 140 comets .
He &apos;s found so many comets , they named a comet after him .
It &apos;s kind of out past Mars . It &apos;s a hike .
I don &apos;t think he &apos;s getting his picture taken there anytime soon .
But he found 140 comets without a telescope .
He downloaded data from the NASA SOHO satellite , and that &apos;s how he found them .
If we can find comets without a telescope , shouldn &apos;t we be able to find words ?
Now , y &apos;all know where I &apos;m going with this .
Because I &apos;m going to the Internet , which is where everybody goes .
And the Internet is great for collecting words , because the Internet &apos;s full of collectors .
And this is a little-known technological fact about the Internet , but the Internet is actually made up of words and enthusiasm .
And words and enthusiasm actually happen to be the recipe for lexicography . Isn &apos;t that great ?
So there are a lot of really good word-collecting sites out there right now , but the problem with some of them is that they &apos;re not scientific enough .
They show the word , but they don &apos;t show any context .
Where did it come from ? Who said it ?
What newspaper was it in ? What book ?
Because a word is like an archaeological artifact .
If you don &apos;t know the provenance or the source of the artifact , it &apos;s not science , it &apos;s a pretty thing to look at .
So a word without its source is like a cut flower .
You know , it &apos;s pretty to look at for a while , but then it dies .
It dies too fast .
So , this whole time I &apos;ve been saying , &quot; The dictionary , the dictionary , the dictionary , the dictionary . &quot;
Not &quot; a dictionary , &quot; or &quot; dictionaries . &quot; And that &apos;s because , well , people use the dictionary to stand for the whole language .
They use it synecdochically .
And one of the problems of knowing a word like &quot; synecdochically &quot; is that you really want an excuse to say &quot; synecdochically . &quot;
This whole talk has just been an excuse to get me to the point where I could say &quot; synecdochically &quot; to all of you .
So I &apos;m really sorry . But when you use a part of something -- like the dictionary is a part of the language , or a flag stands for the United States , it &apos;s a symbol of the country -- then you &apos;re using it synecdochically .
But the thing is , we could make the dictionary the whole language .
If we get a bigger pan , then we can put all the words in .
We can put in all the meanings .
Doesn &apos;t everyone want more meaning in their lives ?
And we can make the dictionary not just be a symbol of the language -- we can make it be the whole language .
You see , what I &apos;m really hoping for is that my son , who turns seven this month -- I want him to barely remember that this is the form factor that dictionaries used to come in .
This is what dictionaries used to look like .
I want him to think of this kind of dictionary as an eight-track tape .
It &apos;s a format that died because it wasn &apos;t useful enough .
It wasn &apos;t really what people needed .
And the thing is , if we can put in all the words , no longer have that artificial distinction between good and bad , we can really describe the language like scientists .
We can leave the aesthetic judgments to the writers and the speakers .
If we can do that , then I can spend all my time fishing , and I don &apos;t have to be a traffic cop anymore .
Thank you very much for your kind attention .

&lt; description &gt; Is the beloved paper dictionary doomed to extinction ? In this infectiously exuberant talk , leading lexicographer Erin McKean looks at the many ways today &apos;s print dictionary is poised for transformation . &lt; / description &gt;

I still remember the day in school when our teacher told us that the world population had become three billion people , and that was in 1960 .
I &apos;m going to talk now about how world population has changed from that year and into the future , but I will not use digital technology , as I &apos;ve done during my first five TEDTalks .
Instead , I have progressed , and I am , today , launching a brand new analog teaching technology that I picked up from IKE this box .
This box contains one billion people .
And our teacher told us that the industrialized world , 1960 , had one billion people .
In the developing world , she said , they had two billion people .
And they lived away then .
There was a big gap between the one billion in the industrialized world and the two billion in the developing world .
In the industrialized world , people were healthy , educated , rich , and they had small families .
And their aspiration was to buy a car .
And in 1960 , all Swedes were saving to try to buy a Volvo like this .
This was the economic level at which Sweden was .
But in contrast to this , in the developing world , far away , the aspiration of the average family there was to have food for the day .
They were saving to be able to buy a pair of shoes .
There was an enormous gap in the world when I grew up .
And this gap between the West and the rest has created a mindset of the world , which we still use linguistically when we talk about &quot; the West &quot; and &quot; the Developing World . &quot;
But the world has changed , and it &apos;s overdue to upgrade that mindset and that taxonomy of the world , and to understand it .
And that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to show you , because since 1960 what has happened in the world up to 2010 is that a staggering four billion people have been added to the world population .
Just look how many .
The world population has doubled since I went to school .
And of course , there &apos;s been economic growth in the West .
A lot of companies have happened to grow the economy , so the Western population moved over to here .
And now their aspiration is not only to have a car .
Now they want to have a holiday on a very remote destination and they want to fly .
So this is where they are today .
And the most successful of the developing countries , they have moved on , you know , and they have become emerging economies , we call them .
They are now buying cars .
And what happened a month ago was that the Chinese company , Geely , they acquired the Volvo company , and then finally the Swedes understood that something big had happened in the world .
So there they are .
And the tragedy is that the two billion over here that is struggling for food and shoes , they are still almost as poor as they were 50 years ago .
The new thing is that we have the biggest pile of billions , the three billions here , which are also becoming emerging economies , because they are quite healthy , relatively well-educated , and they already also have two to three children per woman , as those &#91; richer also &#93; have .
And their aspiration now is , of course , to buy a bicycle , and then later on they would like to have a motorbike also .
But this is the world we have today , no longer any gap .
But the distance from the poorest here , the very poorest , to the very richest over here is wider than ever .
But there is a continuous world from walking , biking , driving , flying -- there are people on all levels , and most people tend to be somewhere in the middle .
This is the new world we have today in 2010 .
And what will happen in the future ?
Well , I &apos;m going to project into 2050 .
I was in Shanghai recently , and I listened to what &apos;s happening in China , and it &apos;s pretty sure that they will catch up , just as Japan did .
All the projections &#91; say that &#93; this one &#91; billion &#93; will &#91; only &#93; grow with one to two or three percent .
&#91; But this second &#93; grows with seven , eight percent , and then they will end up here .
They will start flying .
And these lower or middle income countries , the emerging income countries , they will also forge forwards economically .
And if , but only if , we invest in the right green technology -- so that we can avoid severe climate change , and energy can still be relatively cheap -- then they will move all the way up here .
And they will start to buy electric cars .
This is what we will find there .
So what about the poorest two billion ?
What about the poorest two billion here ?
Will they move on ?
Well , here population &#91; growth &#93; comes in because there &#91; among emerging economies &#93; we already have two to three children per woman , family planning is widely used , and population growth is coming to an end .
Here &#91; among the poorest &#93; , population is growing .
So these &#91; poorest &#93; two billion will , in the next decades , increase to three billion , and they will thereafter increase to four billion .
There is nothing -- but a nuclear war of a kind we &apos;ve never seen -- that can stop this &#91; growth &#93; from happening .
Because we already have this &#91; growth &#93; in process .
But if , and only if , &#91; the poorest &#93; get out of poverty , they get education , they get improved child survival , they can buy a bicycle and a cell phone and come &#91; to live &#93; here , then population growth will stop in 2050 .
We cannot have people on this level looking for food and shoes because then we get continued population growth .
And let me show you why by converting back to the old-time digital technology .
Here I have on the screen my country bubbles .
Every bubble is a country . The size is population .
The colors show the continent .
The yellow on there is the Americas ; dark blue is Africa ; brown is Europe ; green is the Middle East and this light blue is South Asia .
That &apos;s India and this is China . Size is population .
Here I have children per woman : two children , four children , six children , eight children -- big families , small families .
The year is 1960 .
And down here , child survival , the percentage of children surviving childhood up to starting school : 60 percent , 70 percent , 80 percent , 90 , and almost 100 percent , as we have today in the wealthiest and healthiest countries .
But look , this is the world my teacher talked about in 1960 : one billion Western world here -- high child-survival , small families -- and all the rest , the rainbow of developing countries , with very large families and poor child survival .
What has happened ? I start the world . Here we go .
Can you see , as the years pass by , child survival is increasing ?
They get soap , hygiene , education , vaccination , penicillin and then family planning . Family size is decreasing .
&#91; When &#93; they get up to 90-percent child survival , then families decrease , and most of the Arab countries in the Middle East is falling down there &#91; to small families &#93; .
Look , Bangladesh catching up with India .
The whole emerging world joins the Western world with good child survival and small family size , but we still have the poorest billion .
Can you see the poorest billion , those &#91; two &#93; boxes I had over here ?
They are still up here .
And they still have a child survival of only 70 to 80 percent , meaning that if you have six children born , there will be at least four who survive to the next generation .
And the population will double in one generation .
So the only way of really getting world population &#91; growth &#93; to stop is to continue to improve child survival to 90 percent .
That &apos;s why investments by Gates Foundation , UNICEF and aid organizations , together with national government in the poorest countries , are so good ; because they are actually helping us to reach a sustainable population size of the world .
We can stop at nine billion if we do the right things .
Child survival is the new green .
It &apos;s only by child survival that we will stop population growth .
And will it happen ?
Well , I &apos;m not an optimist , neither am I a pessimist .
I &apos;m a very serious &quot; possibilist . &quot;
It &apos;s a new category where we take emotion apart , and we just work analytically with the world .
It can be done .
We can have a much more just world .
With green technology and with investments to alleviate poverty , and global governance , the world can become like this .
And look at the position of the old West .
Remember when this blue box was all alone , leading the world , living its own life .
This will not happen &#91; again &#93; .
The role of the old West in the new world is to become the foundation of the modern world -- nothing more , nothing less .
But it &apos;s a very important role .
Do it well and get used to it .
Thank you very much .

&lt; title &gt; Hans Rosling : Global population growth , box by box &lt; / title &gt;
&lt; description &gt; The world &apos;s population will grow to 9 billion over the next 50 years -- and only by raising the living standards of the poorest can we check population growth . This is the paradoxical answer that Hans Rosling unveils at TED @ Cannes using colorful new data display technology . &lt; / description &gt;
&lt; keywords &gt; culture , data , demo , global issues , poverty , prediction , presentation &lt; / keywords &gt;
&lt; url &gt; http : / / www.ted.com / talks / vs _ ramachandran _ the _ neurons _ that _ shaped _ civilization.html &lt; / url &gt;
I &apos;d like to talk to you today about the human brain , which is what we do research on at the University of California .
Just think about this problem for a second .
Here is a lump of flesh , about three pounds , which you can hold in the palm of your hand .
But it can contemplate the vastness of interstellar space .
It can contemplate the meaning of infinity , ask questions about the meaning of its own existence , about the nature of God .
And this is truly the most amazing thing in the world .
It &apos;s the greatest mystery confronting human beings : How does this all come about ?
Well , the brain , as you know , is made up of neurons .
We &apos;re looking at neurons here .
There are 100 billion neurons in the adult human brain .
And each neuron makes something like 1,000 to 10,000 contacts with other neurons in the brain .
And based on this , people have calculated that the number of permutations and combinations of brain activity exceeds the number of elementary particles in the universe .
So , how do you go about studying the brain ?
One approach is to look at patients who had lesions in different part of the brain , and study changes in their behavior .
This is what I spoke about in the last TED .
Today I &apos;ll talk about a different approach , which is to put electrodes in different parts of the brain , and actually record the activity of individual nerve cells in the brain .
Sort of eavesdrop on the activity of nerve cells in the brain .
Now , one recent discovery that has been made by researchers in Italy , in Parma , by Giacomo Rizzolatti and his colleagues , is a group of neurons called mirror neurons , which are on the front of the brain in the frontal lobes .
Now , it turns out there are neurons which are called ordinary motor command neurons in the front of the brain , which have been known for over 50 years .
These neurons will fire when a person performs a specific action .
For example , if I do that , and reach and grab an apple , a motor command neuron in the front of my brain will fire .
If I reach out and pull an object , another neuron will fire , commanding me to pull that object .
These are called motor command neurons that have been known for a long time .
But what Rizzolatti found was a subset of these neurons , maybe about 20 percent of them , will also fire when I &apos;m looking at somebody else performing the same action .
So , here is a neuron that fires when I reach and grab something , but it also fires when I watch Joe reaching and grabbing something .
And this is truly astonishing .
Because it &apos;s as though this neuron is adopting the other person &apos;s point of view .
It &apos;s almost as though it &apos;s performing a virtual reality simulation of the other person &apos;s action .
Now , what is the significance of these mirror neurons ?
For one thing they must be involved in things like imitation and emulation .
Because to imitate a complex act requires my brain to adopt the other person &apos;s point of view .
So , this is important for imitation and emulation .
Well , let &apos;s take a look at the next slide .
So , how do you do imitation ? Why is imitation important ?
Mirror neurons and imitation , emulation .
Now , let &apos;s look at culture , the phenomenon of human culture .
If you go back in time about &#91; 75,000 &#93; to 100,000 years ago , let &apos;s look at human evolution , it turns out that something very important happened around 75,000 years ago .
And that is , there is a sudden emergence and rapid spread of a number of skills that are unique to human beings like tool use , the use of fire , the use of shelters , and , of course , language , and the ability to read somebody else &apos;s mind and interpret that person &apos;s behavior .
All of that happened relatively quickly .
Even though the human brain had achieved its present size almost three or four hundred thousand years ago , 100,000 years ago all of this happened very , very quickly .
And I claim that what happened was the sudden emergence of a sophisticated mirror neuron system , which allowed you to emulate and imitate other people &apos;s actions .
So that when there was a sudden accidental discovery or a particular type of tool , instead of dying out , this spread rapidly , horizontally across the population , or was transmitted vertically , down the generations .
So , this made evolution suddenly Lamarckian , instead of Darwinian .
Darwinian evolution is slow ; it takes hundreds of thousands of years .
A polar bear , to evolve a coat , will take thousands of generations , maybe 100,000 years .
A human being , a child , can just watch its parent kill another polar bear , and skin it and put the skin on its body , fur on the body , and learn it in one step . What the polar bear took 100,000 years to learn , it can learn in five minutes , maybe 10 minutes .
And then once it &apos;s learned this it spreads in geometric proportion across a population .
This is the basis . The imitation of complex skills is what we call culture and is the basis of civilization .
Now there is another kind of mirror neuron , which is involved in something quite different .
And that is , there are mirror neurons , just as there are mirror neurons for action , there are mirror neurons for touch .
In other words , if somebody touches me , my hand , neuron in the somatosensory cortex in the sensory region of the brain fires .
But the same neuron , in some cases , will fire when I simply watch another person being touched .
So , it &apos;s empathizing the other person being touched .
So , most of them will fire when I &apos;m touched in different locations . Different neurons for different locations .
But a subset of them will fire even when I watch somebody else being touched in the same location .
So , here again you have neurons which are enrolled in empathy .
Now , the question then arises : If I simply watch another person being touched , why do I not get confused and literally feel that touch sensation merely by watching somebody being touched ?
I mean , I empathize with that person but I don &apos;t literally feel the touch .
Well , that &apos;s because you &apos;ve got receptors in your skin , touch and pain receptors , going back into your brain and saying &quot; Don &apos;t worry , you &apos;re not being touched .
So , empathize , by all means , with the other person , but do not actually experience the touch , otherwise you &apos;ll get confused and muddled . &quot;
Okay , so there is a feedback signal that vetoes the signal of the mirror neuron preventing you from consciously experiencing that touch .
But if you remove the arm , you simply anesthetize my arm , so you put an injection into my arm , anesthetize the brachial plexus , so the arm is numb , and there is no sensations coming in , if I now watch you being touched , I literally feel it in my hand .
In other words , you have dissolved the barrier between you and other human beings .
So , I call them Gandhi neurons , or empathy neurons .
And this is not in some abstract metaphorical sense .
All that &apos;s separating you from him , from the other person , is your skin .
Remove the skin , you experience that person &apos;s touch in your mind .
You &apos;ve dissolved the barrier between you and other human beings .
And this , of course , is the basis of much of Eastern philosophy , and that is there is no real independent self , aloof from other human beings , inspecting the world , inspecting other people .
You are , in fact , connected not just via Facebook and Internet , you &apos;re actually quite literally connected by your neurons .
And there is whole chains of neurons around this room , talking to each other .
And there is no real distinctiveness of your consciousness from somebody else &apos;s consciousness .
And this is not mumbo-jumbo philosophy .
It emerges from our understanding of basic neuroscience .
So , you have a patient with a phantom limb . If the arm has been removed and you have a phantom , and you watch somebody else being touched , you feel it in your phantom .
Now the astonishing thing is , if you have pain in your phantom limb , you squeeze the other person &apos;s hand , massage the other person &apos;s hand , that relieves the pain in your phantom hand , almost as though the neuron were obtaining relief from merely watching somebody else being massaged .
So , here you have my last slide .
For the longest time people have regarded science and humanities as being distinct .
C.P. Snow spoke of the two cultures : science on the one hand , humanities on the other ; never the twain shall meet .
So , I &apos;m saying the mirror neuron system underlies the interface allowing you to rethink about issues like consciousness , representation of self , what separates you from other human beings , what allows you to empathize with other human beings , and also even things like the emergence of culture and civilization , which is unique to human beings . Thank you .

Last year at TED we aimed to try to clarify the overwhelming complexity and richness that we experience at the conference in a project called Big Viz .
And the Big Viz is a collection of 650 sketches that were made by two visual artists .
David Sibbet from The Grove , and Kevin Richards , from Autodesk , made 650 sketches that strive to capture the essence of each presenter &apos;s ideas .
And the consensus was : it really worked .
These sketches brought to life the key ideas , the portraits , the magic moments that we all experienced last year .
This year we were thinking , &quot; Why does it work ? &quot;
What is it about animation , graphics , illustrations , that create meaning ?
And this is an important question to ask and answer because the more we understand how the brain creates meaning , the better we can communicate , and , I also think , the better we can think and collaborate together .
So this year we &apos;re going to visualize how the brain visualizes .
Cognitive psychologists now tell us that the brain doesn &apos;t actually see the world as it is , but instead , creates a series of mental models through a collection of &quot; Ah-ha moments , &quot; or moments of discovery , through various processes .
The processing , of course , begins with the eyes .
Light enters , hits the back of the retina , and is circulated , most of which is streamed to the very back of the brain , at the primary visual cortex .
And primary visual cortex sees just simple geometry , just the simplest of shapes .
But it also acts like a kind of relay station that re-radiates and redirects information to many other parts of the brain .
As many as 30 other parts that selectively make more sense , create more meaning through the kind of &quot; Ah-ha &quot; experiences .
We &apos;re only going to talk about three of them .
So the first one is called the ventral stream .
It &apos;s on this side of the brain .
And this is the part of the brain that will recognize what something is .
It &apos;s the &quot; what &quot; detector .
Look at a hand . Look at a remote control . Chair . Book .
So that &apos;s the part of the brain that is activated when you give a word to something .
A second part of the brain is called the dorsal stream .
And what it does is locates the object in physical body space .
So if you look around the stage here you &apos;ll create a kind of mental map of the stage .
And if you closed your eyes you &apos;d be able to mentally navigate it .
You &apos;d be activating the dorsal stream if you did that .
The third part that I &apos;d like to talk about is the limbic system .
And this is deep inside of the brain . It &apos;s very old , evolutionarily .
And it &apos;s the part that feels .
It &apos;s the kind of gut center , where you see an image and you go , &quot; Oh ! I have a strong or emotional reaction to whatever I &apos;m seeing . &quot;
So the combination of these processing centers help us make meaning in very different ways .
So what can we learn about this ? How can we apply this insight ?
Well , again , the schematic view is that the eye visually interrogates what we look at .
The brain processes this in parallel , the figments of information asking a whole bunch of questions to create a unified mental model .
So , for example , when you look at this image a good graphic invites the eye to dart around , to selectively create a visual logic .
So the act of engaging , and looking at the image creates the meaning .
It &apos;s the selective logic .
Now we &apos;ve augmented this and spatialized this information .
Many of you may remember the magic wall that we built in conjunction with Perceptive Pixel where we quite literally create an infinite wall .
And so we can compare and contrast the big ideas .
So the act of engaging and creating interactive imagery enriches meaning .
It activates a different part of the brain .
And then the limbic system is activated when we see motion , when we see color , and there are primary shapes and pattern detectors that we &apos;ve heard about before .
So the point of this is what ?
We make meaning by seeing , by an act of visual interrogation .
The lessons for us are three-fold .
First , use images to clarify what we &apos;re trying to communicate .
Secondly make those images interactive so that we engage much more fully .
And the third is to augment memory by creating a visual persistence .
These are techniques that can be used to be -- that can be applied in a wide range of problem solving .
So the low-tech version looks like this .
And , by the way , this is the way in which we develop and formulate strategy within Autodesk , in some of our organizations and some of our divisions .
What we literally do is have the teams draw out the entire strategic plan on one giant wall .
And it &apos;s very powerful because everyone gets to see everything else .
There &apos;s always a room , always a place to be able to make sense of all of the components in the strategic plan .
This is a time-lapse view of it .
You can ask the question , &quot; Who &apos;s the boss ? &quot;
You &apos;ll be able to figure that out .
So the act of collectively and collaboratively building the image transforms the collaboration .
No Powerpoint is used in two days .
But instead the entire team creates a shared mental model that they can all agree on and move forward on .
And this can be enhanced and augmented with some emerging digital technology .
And this is our great unveiling for today .
And this is an emerging set of technologies that use large-screen displays with intelligent calculation in the background to make the invisible visible .
Here what we can do is look at sustainability , quite literally .
So a team can actually look at all the key components that heat the structure and make choices and then see the end result that is visualized on this screen .
So making images meaningful has three components .
The first again , is making ideas clear by visualizing them .
Secondly , making them interactive .
And then thirdly , making them persistent .
And I believe that these three principles can be applied to solving some of the very tough problems that we face in the world today . Thanks so much .

So , now , there are a lot of web 2.0 consultants who make a lot of money .
In fact , they make their livings on this kind of stuff .
I &apos;m going to try and save you all the time and all the money and go through it in the next three minutes , so bear with me .
Started a website back in 2005 , with a few friends of mine , called Reddit.com.
That &apos;s what you &apos;d call a social news website .
Basically all that means is that the democratic front page is the best stuff on the web . You find some interesting content , say a TEDTalk , submit it to Reddit , and the community of your peers will vote it up if they like it , vote it down if they don &apos;t .
And that creates the front page . It &apos;s always rising , falling , always changing .
About a half million people visit every day . But this isn &apos;t about Reddit .
This is actually about discovering new things that pop up on the web .
Because in the last four years we &apos;ve seen all kinds of memes , all kinds of trends get born right on our front page .
But this isn &apos;t even about Reddit itself .
It &apos;s actually about humpback whales .
Well , okay , technically it &apos;s actually about Greenpeace , which is an environmental organization that wanted to stop the Japanese government on their whaling campaign .
These humpback whales were getting killed .
They wanted to put an end to it . And one of the ways they wanted to do it was to put a tracking chip inside one of these humpback whales .
But to really kind of personify the movement , they wanted to name it .
So , in true web fashion they put together a poll where they had a bunch of very erudite , very thoughtful , cultured names .
I believe this is a Farsi word for &quot; immortal . &quot;
I think this means &quot; divine power of the ocean &quot; in a Polynesian language .
And then there was this : Mister Splashy Pants .
And this , this was special . Mister Pants , or Splashy , to his friends , was very popular on the Internet .
In fact , someone on Reddit thought , &quot; Oh , what a great thing , we should all vote this up . &quot;
And , you know , Redditors responded and all agreed .
So , the voting started and we actually got behind it ourselves .
We changed our logo , for the day , from the alien to a Splashy , to sort of help the cause .
And it wasn &apos;t long before other sites like Fark and Boing Boing and the rest of the Internet started saying , &quot; Yes ! We love Splashy Pants . &quot;
So , it went from about five percent , which was when this meme started , to 70 percent at the end of voting .
Which is pretty impressive right ? We won ! Mister Splashy Pants was chosen . Hmm , just kidding . Okay .
So , Greenpeace actually wasn &apos;t that crazy about it , because they wanted one of their more thoughtful names to win .
So they said , &quot; No , no , just kidding . We &apos;ll give it another week of voting . &quot;
Well , that got us a little angry .
So , we changed it to Fightin &apos; Splashy .
And the Reddit community , really , and the rest of the internet , rather , really got behind this .
Facebook groups were getting created . Facebook applications were getting created .
The idea was , &quot; Vote your conscience , &quot; vote for Mister Splashy Pants .
And people were putting up signs in the real world -- -- about this whale .
And this was the final vote . When all was cleared ...
78 percent of the votes , and to give you an idea of the landslide , the next highest name pulled in three . Okay ?
So , there was a clear lesson here .
And that was that the Internet loves Mister Splashy Pants .
Which is obvious . It &apos;s a great name .
Everyone wants to hear their news anchor say , &quot; Mister Splashy Pants . &quot;
And I think that &apos;s what helped drive this .
But what was cool was that the repercussions now for Greenpeace was , they created an entire marketing campaign around it .
They sell Mister Splashy Pants shirts and pins .
They even created an e-card so you could send your friend a dancing Splashy .
But what was even more important was the fact that they actually accomplished their mission . The Japanese government called off their whaling expedition . Mission accomplished .
Greenpeace was thrilled . The whales were happy . That &apos;s a quote .
And actually , Redditors in the Internet community were happy to participate , but they weren &apos;t whale lovers .
A few of them certainly were . But we &apos;re talking about a lot of people who were just really interested and really caught up in this great meme , and in fact someone from Greenpeace came back on the site and thanked Reddit for its participation .
But this wasn &apos;t really out of altruism . This was just out of interest in doing something cool .
And this is kind of how the Internet works .
This is that great big secret . Because the Internet provides this level playing field .
Your link is just as good as your link , which is just as good as my link . As long as we have a browser , anyone can get to any website no matter how big a budget you have .
That is , as long as you can keep net neutrality in place .
The other important thing is that it costs nothing to get that content online now .
There are so many great publishing tools that are available , it only takes a few minutes of your time now to actually produce something .
And the cost of iteration is so cheap that you might as well give it a go .
And if you do , be genuine about it . Be honest . Be up front .
And one of the great lessons that Greenpeace actually learned was that it &apos;s okay to lose control .
It &apos;s okay to take yourself a little less seriously , given that , even though it &apos;s a very serious cause , you could ultimately achieve your final goal .
And that &apos;s the final message that I want to share with all of you -- that you can do well online .
But no longer is the message going to be coming from just the top down .
If you want to succeed you &apos;ve got to be okay to just lose control .
Thank you .

&lt; url &gt; http : / / www.ted.com / talks / mitchell _ joachim _ don _ t _ build _ your _ home _ grow _ it.html &lt; / url &gt;
Why grow homes ? Because we can .
Right now , America is in an unremitting state of trauma .
And there &apos;s a cause for that , all right .
We &apos;ve got McPeople , McCars , McHouses .
As an architect , I have to confront something like this .
So what &apos;s a technology that will allow us to make ginormous houses ?
Well , it &apos;s been around for 2,500 years .
It &apos;s called pleaching , or grafting trees together , or grafting inosculate matter into one contiguous , vascular system .
And we do something different than what we did in the past ; we add kind of a modicum of intelligence to that .
We use CNC to make scaffolding to train semi-epithetic matter , plants , into a specific geometry that makes a home that we call a Fab Tree Hab .
It fits into the environment . It is the environment .
It is the landscape , right ?
And you can have a hundred million of these homes , and it &apos;s great because they suck carbon .
They &apos;re perfect .
You can have 100 million families , or take things out of the suburbs , because these are homes that are a part of the environment .
Imagine pre-growing a village -- it takes about seven to 10 years -- and everything is green .
So not only do we do the veggie house , we also do the in-vitro meat habitat , or homes that we &apos;re doing research on now in Brooklyn , where , as an architecture office , we &apos;re for the first of its kind to put in a molecular cell biology lab and start experimenting with regenerative medicine and tissue engineering and start thinking about what the future would be if architecture and biology became one .
So we &apos;ve been doing this for a couple of years , and that &apos;s our lab .
And what we do is we grow extracellular matrix from pigs .
We use a modified inkjet printer , and we print geometry .
We print geometry where we can make industrial design objects like , you know , shoes , leather belts , handbags , etc . , where no sentient creature is harmed .
It &apos;s victimless . It &apos;s meat from a test tube .
So our theory is that eventually we should be doing this with homes .
So here is a typical stud wall , an architectural construction , and this is a section of our proposal for a meat house , where you can see we use fatty cells as insulation , cilia for dealing with wind loads and sphincter muscles for the doors and windows .
And we know it &apos;s incredibly ugly .
It could have been an English Tudor or Spanish Colonial , but we kind of chose this shape .
And there it is kind of grown , at least one particular section of it .
We had a big show in Prague , and we decided to put it in front of the cathedral so religion can confront the house of meat .
That &apos;s why we grow homes . Thanks very much .

The world is changing with really remarkable speed .
If you look at the chart at the top here , you &apos;ll see that in 2025 , these Goldman Sachs projections suggest that the Chinese economy will be almost the same size as the American economy .
And if you look at the chart for 2050 , it &apos;s projected that the Chinese economy will be twice the size of the American economy , and the Indian economy will be almost the same size as the American economy .
And we should bear in mind here that these projections were drawn up before the Western financial crisis .
A couple of weeks ago , I was looking at the latest projection by BNP Paribas for when China will have a larger economy than the United States .
Goldman Sachs projected 2027 .
The post-crisis projection is 2020 .
That &apos;s just a decade away .
China is going to change the world in two fundamental respects .
First of all , it &apos;s a huge developing country with a population of 1.3 billion people , which has been growing for over 30 years at around 10 percent a year .
And within a decade , it will have the largest economy in the world .
Never before in the modern era has the largest economy in the world been that of a developing country , rather than a developed country .
Secondly , for the first time in the modern era , the dominant country in the world -- which I think is what China will become -- will be not from the West and from very , very different civilizational roots .
Now , I know it &apos;s a widespread assumption in the West that as countries modernize , they also westernize .
This is an illusion .
It &apos;s an assumption that modernity is a product simply of competition , markets and technology .
It is not . It is also shaped equally by history and culture .
China is not like the West , and it will not become like the West .
It will remain in very fundamental respects very different .
Now the big question here is obviously , how do we make sense of China ?
How do we try to understand what China is ?
And the problem we have in the West at the moment , by and large , is that the conventional approach is that we understand it really in Western terms , using Western ideas .
We can &apos;t .
Now I want to offer you three building blocks for trying to understand what China is like , just as a beginning .
The first is this : that China is not really a nation-state .
Okay , it &apos;s called itself a nation-state for the last hundred years , but everyone who knows anything about China knows it &apos;s a lot older than this .
This was what China looked like with the victory of the Qin Dynasty in 221 B.C. at the end of the warring-state period -- the birth of modern China .
And you can see it against the boundaries of modern China .
Or immediately afterward , the Han Dynasty , still 2,000 years ago .
And you can see already it occupies most of what we now know as Eastern China , which is where the vast majority of Chinese lived then and live now .
Now what is extraordinary about this is , what gives China its sense of being China , what gives the Chinese the sense of what it is to be Chinese , comes not from the last hundred years , not from the nation-state period , which is what happened in the West , but from the period , if you like , of the civilization-state .
I &apos;m thinking here , for example , of customs like ancestral worship , of a very distinctive notion of the state , likewise , a very distinctive notion of the family , social relationships like guanxi , Confucian values and so on .
These are all things that come from the period of the civilization-state .
In other words , China , unlike the Western states and most countries in the world , is shaped by its sense of civilization , its existence as a civilization-state , rather than as a nation-state .
And there &apos;s one other thing to add to this , and that is this : Of course we know China &apos;s big , huge , demographically and geographically , with a population of 1.3 billion people .
What we often aren &apos;t really aware of is the fact that China is extremely diverse and very pluralistic , and in many ways very decentralized .
You can &apos;t run a place on this scale simply from Beijing , even though we think this to be the case .
It &apos;s never been the case .
So this is China , a civilization-state , rather than a nation-state .
And what does it mean ?
Well , I think it has all sorts of profound implications .
I &apos;ll give you two quick ones .
The first is that the most important political value for the Chinese is unity , is the maintenance of Chinese civilization .
You know , 2,000 years ago , Europe : breakdown -- the fragmentation of the Holy Roman Empire .
It divided , and it &apos;s remained divided ever since .
China , over the same time period , went in exactly the opposite direction , very painfully holding this huge civilization , civilization-state , together .
The second is maybe more prosaic , which is Hong Kong .
Do you remember the handover of Hong Kong by Britain to China in 1997 ?
You may remember what the Chinese constitutional proposition was .
One country , two systems .
And I &apos;ll lay a wager that barely anyone in the West believed them .
&quot; Window dressing .
When China gets its hands on Hong Kong , that won &apos;t be the case . &quot;
Thirteen years on , the political and legal system in Hong Kong is as different now as it was in 1997 .
We were wrong . Why were we wrong ?
We were wrong because we thought , naturally enough , in nation-state ways .
Think of German unification , 1990 .
What happened ?
Well , basically the East was swallowed by the West .
One nation , one system .
That is the nation-state mentality .
But you can &apos;t run a country like China , a civilization-state , on the basis of one civilization , one system .
It doesn &apos;t work .
So actually the response of China to the question of Hong Kong -- as it will be to the question of Taiwan -- was a natural response : one civilization , many systems .
Let me offer you another building block to try and understand China -- maybe not sort of a comfortable one .
The Chinese have a very , very different conception of race to most other countries .
Do you know , of the 1.3 billion Chinese , over 90 percent of them think they belong to the same race , the Han ?
Now , this is completely different from the world &apos;s &#91; other &#93; most populous countries .
India , the United States , Indonesia , Brazil -- all of them are multiracial .
The Chinese don &apos;t feel like that .
China is only multiracial really at the margins .
So the question is , why ?
Well the reason , I think , essentially is , again , back to the civilization-state .
A history of at least 2,000 years , a history of conquest , occupation , absorption , assimilation and so on , led to the process by which , over time , this notion of the Han emerged -- of course , nurtured by a growing and very powerful sense of cultural identity .
Now the great advantage of this historical experience has been that , without the Han , China could never have held together .
The Han identity has been the cement which has held this country together .
The great disadvantage of it is that the Han have a very weak conception of cultural difference .
They really believe in their own superiority , and they are disrespectful of those who are not .
Hence their attitude , for example , to the Uyghurs and to the Tibetans .
Or let me give you my third building block , the Chinese state .
Now the relationship between the state and society in China is very different from that in the West .
Now we in the West overwhelmingly seem to think -- in these days at least -- that the authority and legitimacy of the state is a function of democracy .
The problem with this proposition is that the Chinese state enjoys more legitimacy and more authority amongst the Chinese than is true with any Western state .
And the reason for this is because -- well , there are two reasons , I think .
And it &apos;s obviously got nothing to do with democracy , because in our terms the Chinese certainly don &apos;t have a democracy .
And the reason for this is , firstly , because the state in China is given a very special -- it enjoys a very special significance as the representative , the embodiment and the guardian of Chinese civilization , of the civilization-state .
This is as close as China gets to a kind of spiritual role .
And the second reason is because , whereas in Europe and North America , the state &apos;s power is continuously challenged -- I mean in the European tradition , historically against the church , against other sectors of the aristocracy , against merchants and so on -- for 1,000 years , the power of the Chinese state has not been challenged .
It &apos;s had no serious rivals .
So you can see that the way in which power has been constructed in China is very different from our experience in Western history .
The result , by the way , is that the Chinese have a very different view of the state .
Whereas we tend to view it as an intruder , a stranger , certainly an organ whose powers need to be limited or defined and constrained , the Chinese don &apos;t see the state like that at all .
The Chinese view the state as an intimate -- not just as an intimate actually , as a member of the family -- not just in fact as a member of the family , but as the head of the family , the patriarch of the family .
This is the Chinese view of the state -- very , very different to ours .
It &apos;s embedded in society in a different kind of way to what is the case in the West .
And I would suggest to you that actually what we are dealing with here , in the Chinese context , is a new kind of paradigm , which is different from anything we &apos;ve had to think about in the past .
Know that China believes in the market and the state .
I mean , Adam Smith , already writing in the late 18th century , said , &quot; The Chinese market is larger and more developed and more sophisticated than anything in Europe . &quot;
And , apart from the Mao period , that has remained more or less the case ever since .
But this is combined with an extremely strong and ubiquitous state .
The state is everywhere in China .
I mean , it &apos;s leading firms -- many of them are still publicly owned .
Private firms , however large they are , like Lenovo , depend in many ways on state patronage .
Targets for the economy and so on are set by the state .
And the state , of course , its authority flows into lots of other areas -- as we are familiar with -- with something like the one-child policy .
Moreover , this is a very old state tradition , a very old tradition of statecraft .
I mean , if you want an illustration of this , the Great Wall is one .
But this is another , this is the Grand Canal , which was constructed in the first instance in the fifth century B.C.
and was finally completed in the seventh century A.D.
It went for 1,114 miles , linking Beijing with Hangzhou and Shanghai .
So there &apos;s a long history of extraordinary state infrastructural projects in China , which I suppose helps us to explain what we see today , which is something like the Three Gorges Dam and many other expressions of state competence within China .
So there we have three building blocks for trying to understand the difference that is China -- the civilization-state , the notion of race and the nature of the state and its relationship to society .
And yet we still insist , by and large , in thinking that we can understand China by simply drawing on Western experience , looking at it through Western eyes , using Western concepts .
If you want to know why we unerringly seem to get China wrong -- our predictions about what &apos;s going to happen to China are incorrect -- this is the reason .
Unfortunately , I think , I have to say that I think attitude towards China is that of a kind of little Westerner mentality .
It &apos;s kind of arrogant .
It &apos;s arrogant in the sense that we think that we are best , and therefore we have the universal measure .
And secondly , it &apos;s ignorant .
We refuse to really address the issue of difference .
You know , there &apos;s a very interesting passage in a book by Paul Cohen , the American historian .
And Paul Cohen argues that the West thinks of itself as probably the most cosmopolitan of all cultures .
But it &apos;s not .
In many ways , it &apos;s the most parochial , because for 200 years , the West has been so dominant in the world that it &apos;s not really needed to understand other cultures , other civilizations .
Because , at the end of the day , it could , if necessary by force , get its own way .
Whereas those cultures -- virtually the rest of the world , in fact , which have been in a far weaker position , vis-a-vis the West -- have been thereby forced to understand the West , because of the West &apos;s presence in those societies .
And therefore , they are , as a result , more cosmopolitan in many ways than the West .
I mean , take the question of East Asia .
East Asia : Japan , Korea , China , etc . -- a third of the world &apos;s population lives there .
Now the largest economic region in the world .
And I &apos;ll tell you now , that East Asianers , people from East Asia , are far more knowledgeable about the West than the West is about East Asia .
Now this point is very germane , I &apos;m afraid , to the present .
Because what &apos;s happening ? Back to that chart at the beginning , the Goldman Sachs chart .
What is happening is that , very rapidly in historical terms , the world is being driven and shaped , not by the old developed countries , but by the developing world .
We &apos;ve seen this in terms of the G20 usurping very rapidly the position of the G7 , or the G8 .
And there are two consequences of this .
First , the West is rapidly losing its influence in the world .
There was a dramatic illustration of this actually a year ago -- Copenhagen , climate change conference .
Europe was not at the final negotiating table .
When did that last happen ?
I would wager it was probably about 200 years ago .
And that is what is going to happen in the future .
And the second implication is that the world will inevitably , as a consequence , become increasingly unfamiliar to us , because it &apos;ll be shaped by cultures and experiences and histories that we are not really familiar with , or conversant with .
And at last , I &apos;m afraid -- take Europe ; America is slightly different -- but Europeans by and large , I have to say , are ignorant , are unaware about the way the world is changing .
Some people -- I &apos;ve got an English friend in China , and he said , &quot; The continent is sleepwalking into oblivion . &quot;
Well , maybe that &apos;s true , maybe that &apos;s an exaggeration .
But there &apos;s another problem which goes along with this -- that Europe is increasingly out of touch with the world -- and that is a sort of loss of a sense of the future .
I mean , Europe once , of course , once commanded the future in its confidence .
Take the 19th century , for example .
But this , alas , is no longer true .
If you want to feel the future , if you want to taste the future , try China -- there &apos;s old Confucius .
This is a railway station the likes of which you &apos;ve never seen before .
It doesn &apos;t even look like a railway station .
This is the new Guangzhou railway station for the high-speed trains .
China already has a bigger network than any other country in the world and will soon have more than all the rest of the world put together .
Or take this : now this is an idea , but it &apos;s an idea to be tried out shortly in a suburb of Beijing .
Here you have a megabus , on the upper deck carries about 2,000 people .
It travels on rails down a suburban road , and the cars travel underneath it .
And it does speeds of up to about 100 miles an hour .
Now this is the way things are going to move , because China has a very specific problem , which is different from Europe and different from the United States : China has huge numbers of people and no space .
So this is a solution to a situation where China &apos;s going to have many , many , many cities over 20 million people .
Okay , so how would I like to finish ?
Well , what should our attitude be towards this world that we see very rapidly developing before us ?
I think there will be good things about it and there will be bad things about it .
But I want to argue , above all , a big-picture positive for this world .
For 200 years , the world was essentially governed by a fragment of the human population .
That &apos;s what Europe and North America represented .
The arrival of countries like China and India -- between them 38 percent of the world &apos;s population -- and others like Indonesia and Brazil and so on , represent the most important single act of democratization in the last 200 years .
Civilizations and cultures , which had been ignored , which had no voice , which were not listened to , which were not known about , will have a different sort of representation in this world .
As humanists , we must welcome , surely , this transformation , and we will have to learn about these civilizations .
This big ship here was the one sailed in by Zheng He in the early 15th century on his great voyages around the South China Sea , the East China Sea and across the Indian Ocean to East Africa .
The little boat in front of it was the one in which , 80 years later , Christopher Columbus crossed the Atlantic .
Or , look carefully at this silk scroll made by ZhuZhou in 1368 .
I think they &apos;re playing golf .
Christ , the Chinese even invented golf .
Welcome to the future . Thank you .

&lt; title &gt; Martin Jacques : Understanding the rise of China &lt; / title &gt;
&lt; description &gt; Speaking at a Salon in London , economist Martin Jacques asks : How do we in the West make sense of China and its phenomenal rise ? The author of &quot; When China Rules the World , &quot; he examines why the West often puzzles over the growing power of the Chinese economy , and offers three building blocks for understanding what China is and will become . &lt; / description &gt;

&lt; url &gt; http : / / www.ted.com / talks / ann _ cooper _ talks _ school _ lunches.html &lt; / url &gt;
My thing with school lunch is , it &apos;s a social justice issue .
I &apos;m the Director of Nutrition Services for the Berkeley Unified School District . I have 90 employees and 17 locations , 9,600 kids .
I &apos;m doing 7,100 meals a day and I &apos;ve been doing it for two years , trying to change how we feed kids in America .
And that &apos;s what I want to talk to you a little bit about today .
These are some of my kids with a salad bar .
I put salad bars in all of our schools when I got there .
Everyone says it couldn &apos;t be done .
Little kids couldn &apos;t eat off the salad bar , big kids would spit in it -- neither happened .
When I took over this , I tried to really figure out , like , what my vision would be .
How do we really change children &apos;s relationship to food ?
And I &apos;ll tell you why we need to change it , but we absolutely have to change it .
And what I came to understand is , we needed to teach children the symbiotic relationship between a healthy planet , healthy food and healthy kids .
And that if we don &apos;t do that , the antithesis , although we &apos;ve heard otherwise , is we &apos;re really going to become extinct , because we &apos;re feeding our children to death .
That &apos;s my premise .
We &apos;re seeing sick kids get sicker and sicker .
And the reason this is happening , by and large , is because of our food system and the way the government commodifies food , the way the government oversees our food , the way the USDA puts food on kids &apos; plates that &apos;s unhealthy , and allows unhealthy food into schools .
And by -- tacitly , all of us send our kids , or grandchildren , or nieces , or nephews , to school and tell them to learn , you know , learn what &apos;s in those schools .
And when you feed these kids bad food , that &apos;s what they &apos;re learning . So that &apos;s really what this is all about .
The way we got here is because of big agribusiness .
We now live in a country where most of us don &apos;t decide , by and large , what we eat . We see big businesses , Monsanto and DuPont , who brought out Agent Orange and stain-resistant carpet .
They control 90 percent of the commercially produced seeds in our country .
These are -- 10 companies control much of what &apos;s in our grocery stores , much of what people eat . And that &apos;s really , really a problem .
So when I started thinking about these issues and how I was going to change what kids ate , I really started focusing on what we would teach them .
And the very first thing was about regional food -- trying to eat food from within our region .
And clearly , with what &apos;s going on with fossil fuel usage , or when -- as the fossil fuel is going away , as oil hits its peak oil , you know , we really have to start thinking about whether or not we should , or could , be moving food 1,500 miles before we eat it .
So we talked to kids about that , and we really start to feed kids regional food .
And then we talk about organic food .
Now , most school districts can &apos;t really afford organic food , but we , as a nation , have to start thinking about consuming , growing and feeding our children food that &apos;s not chock-full of chemicals .
We can &apos;t keep feeding our kids pesticides and herbicides and antibiotics and hormones .
We can &apos;t keep doing that .
You know , it doesn &apos;t work .
And the results of that are kids getting sick .
One of my big soapboxes right now is antibiotics .
Seventy percent of all antibiotics consumed in America is consumed in animal husbandry .
We are feeding our kids antibiotics in beef and other animal protein every day .
Seventy percent -- it &apos;s unbelievable .
And the result of it is , we have diseases .
We have things like E. coli that we can &apos;t fix , that we can &apos;t make kids better when they get sick .
And , you know , certainly antibiotics have been over-prescribed , but it &apos;s an issue in the food supply .
One of my favorite facts is that U.S. agriculture uses 1.2 billion pounds of pesticides every year .
That means every one of us , and our children , consumes what would equal a five-pound bag -- those bags you have at home . If I had one here and ripped it open , and that pile I would have on the floor is what we consume and feed our children every year because of what goes into our food supply , because of the way we consume produce in America .
The USDA allows these antibiotics , these hormones and these pesticides in our food supply , and the USDA paid for this ad in Time magazine .
Okay , we could talk about Rachel Carson and DDT , but we know it wasn &apos;t good for you and me .
And that is what the USDA allows in our food supply .
And that has to change , you know .
The USDA cannot be seen as the be-all and end-all of what we feed our kids and what &apos;s allowed .
We cannot believe that they have our best interests at heart .
The antithesis of this whole thing is sustainable food .
That &apos;s what I really try and get people to understand .
I really try and teach it to kids . I think it &apos;s the most important .
It &apos;s consuming food in a way in which we &apos;ll still have a planet , in which kids will grow up to be healthy , and which really tries to mitigate all the negative impacts we &apos;re seeing .
It really is just a new idea .
I mean , people toss around sustainability , but we have to figure out what sustainability is .
In less than 200 years , you know , just in a few generations , we &apos;ve gone from being 200 -- being 100 percent , 95 percent farmers to less than 2 percent of farmers .
We now live in a country that has more prisoners than farmers -- 2.1 million prisoners , 1.9 million farmers .
And we spend 35,000 dollars on average a year keeping a prisoner in prison , and school districts spend 500 dollars a year feeding a child .
It &apos;s no wonder , you know , we have criminals .
And what &apos;s happening is , we &apos;re getting sick .
We &apos;re getting sick and our kids are getting sick .
It is about what we feed them .
What goes in is what we are .
We really are what we eat .
And if we continue down this path , if we continue to feed kids bad food , if we continue not to teach them what good food is , what &apos;s going to happen ? You know , what is going to happen ?
What &apos;s going to happen to our whole medical system ?
What &apos;s going to happen is , we &apos;re going to have kids that have a life less long than our own .
The CDC , the Center for Disease Control , has said , of the children born in the year 2000 -- those seven- and eight-year-olds today -- one out of every three Caucasians , one out of every two African-Americans and Hispanics are going to have diabetes in their lifetime .
And if that &apos;s not enough , they &apos;ve gone on to say , most before they graduate high school .
This means that 40 or 45 percent of all school-aged children could be insulin-dependent within a decade . Within a decade .
What &apos;s going to happen ?
Well , the CDC has gone further to say that those children born in the year 2000 could be the first generation in our country &apos;s history to die at a younger age than their parents .
And it &apos;s because of what we feed them .
Because eight-year-olds don &apos;t get to decide -- and if they do , you should be in therapy .
You know , we are responsible for what kids eat .
But oops , maybe they &apos;re responsible for what kids eat .
Big companies spend 20 billion dollars a year marketing non-nutrient foods to kids .
20 billion dollars a year . 10,000 ads most kids see .
They spend 500 dollars for every one dollar -- 500 dollars marketing foods that kids shouldn &apos;t eat for every one dollar marketing healthy , nutritious food .
The result of which is kids think they &apos;re going to die if they don &apos;t have chicken nuggets .
You know that everybody thinks they should be eating more , and more , and more .
This is the USDA portion size , that little , tiny thing .
And the one over there , that &apos;s bigger than my head , is what McDonald &apos;s and Burger King and those big companies think we should eat .
And why can they serve that much ?
Why can we have 29-cent Big Gulps and 99-cent double burgers ?
It &apos;s because of the way the government commodifies food , and the cheap corn and cheap soy that are pushed into our food supply that makes these non-nutrient foods really , really cheap .
Which is why I say it &apos;s a social justice issue .
Now , I said I &apos;m doing this in Berkeley , and you might think , &quot; Oh , Berkeley . Of course you can do it in Berkeley . &quot;
Well , this is the food I found 24 months ago .
This is not even food .
This is the stuff we were feeding our kids : Extremo Burritos , corn dogs , pizza pockets , grilled cheese sandwiches .
Everything came in plastic , in cardboard .
The only kitchen tools my staff had was a box cutter .
The only working piece of equipment in my kitchen was a can crusher , because if it didn &apos;t come in a can , it came frozen in a box .
The USDA allows this .
The USDA allows all of this stuff .
In case you can &apos;t tell , that &apos;s , like , pink Danish and some kind of cupcakes .
Chicken nuggets , Tater Tots , chocolate milk with high fructose , canned fruit cocktail -- a reimbursable meal .
That &apos;s what the government says is okay to feed our kids .
It ain &apos;t okay . You know what ? It is not okay .
And we , all of us , have to understand that this is about us , that we can make a difference here .
Now I don &apos;t know if any of you out there invented chicken nuggets , but I &apos;m sure you &apos;re rich if you did .
But whoever decided that a chicken should look like a heart , a giraffe , a star ?
Well , Tyson did , because there &apos;s no chicken in the chicken .
And that they could figure it out , that we could sell this stuff to kids .
You know , what &apos;s wrong with teaching kids that chicken looks like chicken ?
But this is what most schools serve .
In fact , this may be what a lot of parents serve , as opposed to -- this is what we try and serve .
We really need to change this whole paradigm with kids and food .
We really have to teach children that chicken is not a giraffe .
You know , that vegetables are actually colorful , that they have flavor , that carrots grow in the ground , that strawberries grow in the ground .
There &apos;s not a strawberry tree or a carrot bush .
You know , we have to change the way we teach kids about these things .
There &apos;s a lot of stuff we can do . There &apos;s a lot of schools doing farm-to-school programs . There &apos;s a lot of schools actually getting fresh food into schools .
Now , in Berkeley , we &apos;ve gone totally fresh .
We have no high-fructose corn syrup , no trans fats , no processed foods .
We &apos;re cooking from scratch every day .
We have 25 percent of our -- thank you -- 25 percent of our stuff is organic and local . We cook .
Those are my hands . I get up at 4 a.m.
every day and go cook the food for the kids , because this is what we need to do .
We can &apos;t keep serving kids processed crap , full of chemicals , and expect these are going to be healthy citizens .
You &apos;re not going to get the next generation , or the generation after , to be able to think like this if they &apos;re not nourished .
If they &apos;re eating chemicals all the time , they &apos;re not going to be able to think .
They &apos;re not going to be smart .
You know what ? They &apos;re just going to be sick .
Now one of the things that -- what happened when I went into Berkeley is I realized that , you know , this was all pretty amazing to people , very , very different , and I needed to market it .
I came up with these calendars that I sent home to every parent .
And these calendars really started to lay out my program .
Now I &apos;m in charge of all the cooking classes and all the gardening classes in our school district .
So this is a typical menu .
This is what we &apos;re serving this week at the schools .
And you see these recipes on the side ?
Those are the recipes that the kids learn in my cooking classes .
They do tastings of these ingredients in the gardening classes .
They also may be growing them . And we serve them in the cafeterias .
If we &apos;re going to change children &apos;s relationship to food , it &apos;s delicious , nutritious food in the cafeterias , hands-on experience -- you &apos;re looking in cooking and gardening classes -- and academic curriculum to tie it all together .
Now you &apos;ve probably garnered that I don &apos;t love the USDA , and I don &apos;t have any idea what to do with their pyramid , this upside-down pyramid with a rainbow over the top , I don &apos;t know .
You know , run up into the end of the rainbow , I don &apos;t know what you do with it . So , I came up with my own .
This is available on my website in English and Spanish , and it &apos;s a visual way to talk to kids about food .
The really tiny hamburger , the really big vegetables .
We have to start changing this .
We have to make kids understand that their food choices make a big difference .
We have cooking classes -- we have cooking classrooms in our schools .
And why this is so important is that we now have grown a generation , maybe two , of kids where one out of every four meals is eaten in fast food , one of every four meals is eaten in a car and one out of every last four meals is eaten in front of a TV or computer .
What are kids learning ? Where is the family time ?
Where is socialization ? Where is discussion ?
Where is learning to talk ?
You know , we have to change it .
I work with kids a lot . These are kids I work with in Harlem .
EATWISE -- Enlightened and Aware Teens Who Inspire Smart Eating .
We have to teach kids that Coke and Pop Tarts aren &apos;t breakfast .
We have to teach kids that if they &apos;re on a diet of refined sugar , they go up and down , just like if they &apos;re on a diet of crack .
And we have to pull it all together . We have composting in all of our schools .
We have recycling in all of our schools .
You know , the things that we maybe do at home and think are so important , we have to teach kids about in school .
It has to be so much a part of them that they really get it .
Because , you know what , many of us are sort of at the end of our careers , and we need to be giving these kids -- these young kids , the next generation -- the tools to save themselves and save the planet .
One of the things I do a lot is public-private partnerships .
I work with private companies who are willing to do R &amp; amp ; D with me , who are willing to do distribution for me , who are really willing to work to go into schools .
Schools are underfunded .
Most schools in America spend less than 7,500 dollars a year teaching a child .
That comes down to under five dollars an hour .
Most of you spend 10 , 15 dollars an hour for babysitters when you have them .
So we &apos;re spending less than 5 dollars an hour on the educational system .
And if we &apos;re going to change it , and change how we feed kids , we really have to rethink that .
So , public and private partnerships , advocacy groups , working with foundations .
In our school district , the way we afford this is our school district allocates .03 percent of the general fund towards nutrition services . And I think if every school district allocated a half to one percent , we could start to really fix this program .
We really need to change it .
It &apos;s going to take more money .
Of course , it &apos;s not all about food ; it &apos;s also about kids getting exercise .
And one of the simple things we can do is put recess before lunch .
It &apos;s sort of this &quot; duh &quot; thing .
You know , if you have kids coming into lunch and all they &apos;re going to do when they get out of lunch is go to have recess , you see them just throw away their lunch so they can run outside .
And then , at one in the afternoon , they &apos;re totally crashing .
These are your children and grandchildren that are totally melting down when you pick them up , because they haven &apos;t had lunch .
So if the only thing they &apos;d have to do after lunch is go to class , believe me , they &apos;re going to sit there and eat their lunch .
We need to -- we need to educate .
We need to educate the kids .
We need to educate the staff .
I had 90 employees .
Two were supposed to be cooks -- none could .
And , you know , I &apos;m not that better off now .
But we really have to educate .
We have to get academic institutions to start thinking about ways to teach people how to cook again , because , of course , they don &apos;t -- because we &apos;ve had this processed food in schools and institutions for so long .
We need 40-minute lunches -- most schools have 20-minute lunches -- and lunches that are time-appropriate .
There was just a big study done , and so many schools are starting lunch at nine and 10 in the morning .
That is not lunchtime .
You know , it &apos;s crazy . It &apos;s crazy what we &apos;re doing .
And just remember , at very least tacitly , this is what we &apos;re teaching children as what they should be doing .
I think if we &apos;re going to fix this , one of the things we have to do is really change how we have oversight over the National School Lunch Program .
Instead of the National School Lunch Program being under the USDA , I think it should be under CDC .
If we started to think about food and how we feed our kids as a health initiative , and we started thinking about food as health , then I think we wouldn &apos;t have corn dogs as lunch .
Okay , Finance 101 on this , and this -- I &apos;m sort of wrapping it up with this finance piece , because I think this is something we all have to understand .
The National School Lunch Program spends 8 billion dollars feeding 30 million children a year .
That number probably needs to double .
People say , &quot; Oh my God , where are we going to get 8 billion ? &quot;
In this country , we &apos;re spending 110 billion dollars a year on fast food .
We spend 100 billion dollars a year on diet aids .
We spend 50 billion dollars on vegetables , which is why we need all the diet aids .
We spend 200 billion dollars a year on diet-related illness today , with nine percent of our kids having type 2 diabetes .
200 billion .
So you know what , when we talk about needing 8 billion more , it &apos;s not a lot .
That 8 billion comes down to two dollars and 49 cents -- that &apos;s what the government allocates for lunch .
Most school districts spend two thirds of that on payroll and overhead .
That means we spend less than a dollar a day on food for kids in schools -- most schools , 80 to 90 cents . In L.A. , it &apos;s 56 cents .
So we &apos;re spending less than a dollar , OK , on lunch .
Now I don &apos;t know about you , but I go to Starbucks and Pete &apos;s and places like that , and venti latte in San Francisco is five dollars .
One gourmet coffee , one , is more -- we spend more on than we are spending to feed kids for an entire week in our schools .
You know what ? We should be ashamed .
We , as a country , should be ashamed at that .
The richest country .
In our country , it &apos;s the kids that need it the most , who get this really , really lousy food .
It &apos;s the kids who have parents and grandparents and uncles and aunts that can &apos;t even afford to pay for school lunch that gets this food .
And those are the same kids who are going to be getting sick .
Those are the same kids who we should be taking care of .
We can all make a difference .
That every single one of us , whether we have children , whether we care about children , whether we have nieces or nephews , or anything -- that we can make a difference .
Whether you sit down and eat a meal with your kids , whether you take your kids , or grandchildren , or nieces and nephews shopping to a farmers &apos; market . Just do tastings with them .
Sit down and care .
And on the macro level , we &apos;re in what seems to be a 19-month presidential campaign , and of all the things we &apos;re asking all of these potential leaders , what about asking for the health of our children ?
Thank you .

&lt; url &gt; http : / / www.ted.com / talks / evan _ grant _ cymatics.html &lt; / url &gt;
I &apos;m a creative technologist and the focus of my work is on public installations .
One of my driving passions is this idea of exploring nature , and trying to find hidden data within nature .
It seems to me that there is this latent potential everywhere , all around us .
Everything gives out some kind of data , whether it &apos;s sound or smell or vibration .
Through my work , I &apos;ve been trying to find ways to harness and unveil this .
And so this basically led me to a subject called cymatics .
Now , cymatics is the process of visualizing sound by basically vibrating a medium such as sand or water , as you can see there .
So , if we have a quick look at the history of cymatics beginning with the observations of resonance , by Da Vinci , Galileo , the English scientist Robert Hook and then Ernest Chladni .
He created an experiment using a metal plate , covering it with sand and then bowing it to create the Chladni patterns that you see here on the right .
Moving on from this , the next person to explore this field was a gentleman called Hans Jenny in the 1970s .
He actually coined the term cymatics .
Then bringing us into the present day is a fellow collaborator of mine and cymatics expert , John Stewart Reed .
He &apos;s kindly recreated for us the Chladni experiment .
What we can see here is the metal sheet , this time connected to a sound driver and being fed by a frequency generator .
As the frequencies increase , so do the complexities of the patterns that appear on the plate .
As you can see with your own eyes .
So , what excites me about cymatics ?
Well , for me cymatics is an almost magical tool .
It &apos;s like a looking glass into a hidden world .
Through the numerous ways that we can apply cymatics , we can actually start to unveil the substance of things not seen .
Devices like the cymascope , which you can see here , have been used to scientifically observe cymatic patterns .
And the list of scientific applications is growing every day .
For example , in oceanography , a lexicon of dolphin language is actually being created by basically visualizing the sonar beams that the dolphins emit .
And hopefully in the future we &apos;ll be able to gain some deeper understanding of how they communicate .
We can also use cymatics for healing and education .
This is an installation developed with school children , where their hands are tracked . It allows them to control and position cymatic patterns and the reflections that are caused by them .
We can also use cymatics as a beautiful natural art form .
This image here is created from a snippet of Beethoven &apos;s Ninth Symphony playing through a cymatic device .
So it kind of flips things on its head a little bit .
This is Pink Floyd &apos;s &quot; Machine &quot; playing in real time through the cymascope .
We can also use cymatics as a looking glass into nature .
And we can actually recreate the archetypal forms of nature .
So , for example , here on the left we can see a snowflake as it would appear in nature .
Then on the right we can see a cymatically created snowflake .
And here is a starfish and a cymatic starfish .
And there is thousands of these .
So what does this all mean ?
Well , there is still a lot to explore in its early days . And there &apos;s not many people working in this field .
But consider for a moment that sound does have form .
We &apos;ve seen that it can affect matter and cause form within matter .
Then sort of take a leap and think about the universe forming .
And think about the immense sound of the universe forming .
And if we kind of ponder on that , then perhaps cymatics had an influence on the formation of the universe itself .
And here is some eye candy for you , from a range of DIY scientists and artists from all over the globe .
Cymatics is accessible to everybody .
I want to urge everybody here to apply your passion , your knowledge and your skills to areas like cymatics .
I think collectively we can build a global community .
We can inspire each other .
And we can evolve this exploration of the substance of things not seen . Thank you .

&lt; url &gt; http : / / www.ted.com / talks / malcolm _ gladwell _ the _ unheard _ story _ of _ david _ and _ goliath.html &lt; / url &gt;
So I wanted to tell a story that really obsessed me when I was writing my new book , and it &apos;s a story of something that happened 3,000 years ago , when the Kingdom of Israel was in its infancy .
And it takes place in an area called the Shephelah in what is now Israel .
And the reason the story obsessed me is that I thought I understood it , and then I went back over it and I realized that I didn &apos;t understand it at all .
Ancient Palestine had a -- along its eastern border , there &apos;s a mountain range .
Still same is true of Israel today .
And in the mountain range are all of the ancient cities of that region , so Jerusalem , Bethlehem , Hebron .
And then there &apos;s a coastal plain along the Mediterranean , where Tel Aviv is now .
And connecting the mountain range with the coastal plain is an area called the Shephelah , which is a series of valleys and ridges that run east to west , and you can follow the Shephelah , go through the Shephelah to get from the coastal plain to the mountains .
And the Shephelah , if you &apos;ve been to Israel , you &apos;ll know it &apos;s just about the most beautiful part of Israel .
It &apos;s gorgeous , with forests of oak and wheat fields and vineyards .
But more importantly , though , in the history of that region , it &apos;s served , it &apos;s had a real strategic function , and that is , it is the means by which hostile armies on the coastal plain find their way , get up into the mountains and threaten those living in the mountains .
And 3,000 years ago , that &apos;s exactly what happens .
The Philistines , who are the biggest of enemies of the Kingdom of Israel , are living in the coastal plain .
They &apos;re originally from Crete . They &apos;re a seafaring people .
And they may start to make their way through one of the valleys of the Shephelah up into the mountains , because what they want to do is occupy the highland area right by Bethlehem and split the Kingdom of Israel in two .
And the Kingdom of Israel , which is headed by King Saul , obviously catches wind of this , and Saul brings his army down from the mountains and he confronts the Philistines in the Valley of Elah , one of the most beautiful of the valleys of the Shephelah .
And the Israelites dig in along the northern ridge , and the Philistines dig in along the southern ridge , and the two armies just sit there for weeks and stare at each other , because they &apos;re deadlocked .
Neither can attack the other , because to attack the other side you &apos;ve got to come down the mountain into the valley and then up the other side , and you &apos;re completely exposed .
So finally , to break the deadlock , the Philistines send their mightiest warrior down into the valley floor , and he calls out and he says to the Israelites , &quot; Send your mightiest warrior down , and we &apos;ll have this out , just the two of us . &quot;
This was a tradition in ancient warfare called single combat .
It was a way of settling disputes without incurring the bloodshed of a major battle .
And the Philistine who is sent down , their mighty warrior , is a giant .
He &apos;s 6 foot 9 .
He &apos;s outfitted head to toe in this glittering bronze armor , and he &apos;s got a sword and he &apos;s got a javelin and he &apos;s got his spear . He is absolutely terrifying .
And he &apos;s so terrifying that none of the Israelite soldiers want to fight him .
It &apos;s a death wish , right ? There &apos;s no way they think they can take him .
And finally the only person who will come forward is this young shepherd boy , and he goes up to Saul and he says , &quot; I &apos;ll fight him . &quot;
And Saul says , &quot; You can &apos;t fight him . That &apos;s ridiculous .
You &apos;re this kid . This is this mighty warrior . &quot;
But the shepherd is adamant . He says , &quot; No , no , no , you don &apos;t understand , I have been defending my flock against lions and wolves for years . I think I can do it . &quot;
And Saul has no choice . He &apos;s got no one else who &apos;s come forward .
So he says , &quot; All right . &quot;
And then he turns to the kid , and he says , &quot; But you &apos;ve got to wear this armor . You can &apos;t go as you are . &quot;
So he tries to give the shepherd his armor , and the shepherd says , &quot; No . &quot;
He says , &quot; I can &apos;t wear this stuff . &quot;
The Biblical verse is , &quot; I cannot wear this for I have not proved it , &quot; meaning , &quot; I &apos;ve never worn armor before . You &apos;ve got to be crazy . &quot;
So he reaches down instead on the ground and picks up five stones and puts them in his shepherd &apos;s bag and starts to walk down the mountainside to meet the giant .
And the giant sees this figure approaching , and calls out , &quot; Come to me so I can feed your flesh to the birds of the heavens and the beasts of the field . &quot;
He issues this kind of taunt towards this person coming to fight him .
And the shepherd draws closer and closer , and the giant sees that he &apos;s carrying a staff .
That &apos;s all he &apos;s carrying .
Instead of a weapon , just this shepherd &apos;s staff , and he says -- he &apos;s insulted -- &quot; Am I a dog that you would come to me with sticks ? &quot;
And the shepherd boy takes one of his stones out of his pocket , puts it in his sling and rolls it around and lets it fly and it hits the giant right between the eyes -- right here , in his most vulnerable spot -- and he falls down either dead or unconscious , and the shepherd boy runs up and takes his sword and cuts off his head , and the Philistines see this and they turn and they just run .
And of course , the name of the giant is Goliath and the name of the shepherd boy is David , and the reason that story has obsessed me over the course of writing my book is that everything I thought I knew about that story So David , in that story , is supposed to be the underdog , right ?
In fact , that term , David and Goliath , has entered our language as a metaphor for improbable victories by some weak party over someone far stronger .
Now why do we call David an underdog ?
Well , we call him an underdog because he &apos;s a kid , a little kid , and Goliath is this big , strong giant .
We also call him an underdog because Goliath is an experienced warrior , and David is just a shepherd .
But most importantly , we call him an underdog because all he has is -- it &apos;s that Goliath is outfitted with all of this modern weaponry , this glittering coat of armor and a sword and a javelin and a spear , and all David has is this sling .
Well , let &apos;s start there with the phrase &quot; All David has is this sling , &quot; because that &apos;s the first mistake that we make .
In ancient warfare , there are three kinds of warriors .
There &apos;s cavalry , men on horseback and with chariots .
There &apos;s heavy infantry , which are foot soldiers , armed foot soldiers with swords and shields and some kind of armor .
And there &apos;s artillery , and artillery are archers , but , more importantly , slingers .
And a slinger is someone who has a leather pouch with two long cords attached to it , and they put a projectile , either a rock or a lead ball , inside the pouch , and they whirl it around like this and they let one of the cords go , and the effect is to send the projectile forward towards its target .
That &apos;s what David has , and it &apos;s important to understand that that sling is not a slingshot .
It &apos;s not this , right ? It &apos;s not a child &apos;s toy .
It &apos;s in fact an incredibly devastating weapon .
When David rolls it around like this , he &apos;s turning the sling around probably at six or seven revolutions per second , and that means that when the rock is released , it &apos;s going forward really fast , probably 35 meters per second .
That &apos;s substantially faster than a baseball thrown by even the finest of baseball pitchers .
More than that , the stones in the Valley of Elah were not normal rocks . They were barium sulphate , which are rocks twice the density of normal stones .
If you do the calculations on the ballistics , on the stopping power of the rock fired from David &apos;s sling , it &apos;s roughly equal to the stopping power of a &#91; .45 caliber &#93; handgun .
This is an incredibly devastating weapon .
Accuracy , we know from historical records that slingers -- experienced slingers could hit and maim or even kill a target at distances of up to 200 yards .
From medieval tapestries , we know that slingers were capable of hitting birds in flight .
They were incredibly accurate .
When David lines up -- and he &apos;s not 200 yards away from Goliath , he &apos;s quite close to Goliath -- when he lines up and fires that thing at Goliath , he has every intention and every expectation of being able to hit Goliath at his most vulnerable spot between his eyes .
If you go back over the history of ancient warfare , you will find time and time again that slingers were the decisive factor against infantry in one kind of battle or another .
So what &apos;s Goliath ? He &apos;s heavy infantry , and his expectation when he challenges the Israelites to a duel is that he &apos;s going to be fighting another heavy infantryman .
When he says , &quot; Come to me that I might feed your flesh to the birds of the heavens and the beasts of the field , &quot; the key phrase is &quot; Come to me . &quot;
Come up to me because we &apos;re going to fight , hand to hand , like this .
Saul has the same expectation .
David says , &quot; I want to fight Goliath , &quot; and Saul tries to give him his armor , because Saul is thinking , &quot; Oh , when you say &apos; fight Goliath , &apos; you mean &apos; fight him in hand-to-hand combat , &apos; infantry on infantry . &quot;
But David has absolutely no expectation .
He &apos;s not going to fight him that way . Why would he ?
He &apos;s a shepherd . He &apos;s spent his entire career using a sling to defend his flock against lions and wolves .
That &apos;s where his strength lies .
So here he is , this shepherd , experienced in the use of a devastating weapon , up against this lumbering giant weighed down by a hundred pounds of armor and these incredibly heavy weapons that are useful only in short-range combat .
Goliath is a sitting duck . He doesn &apos;t have a chance .
So why do we keep calling David an underdog , and why do we keep referring to his victory as improbable ?
There &apos;s a second piece of this that &apos;s important .
It &apos;s not just that we misunderstand David and his choice of weaponry .
It &apos;s also that we profoundly misunderstand Goliath .
Goliath is not what he seems to be .
There &apos;s all kinds of hints of this in the Biblical text , things that are in retrospect quite puzzling and don &apos;t square with his image as this mighty warrior .
So to begin with , the Bible says that Goliath is led onto the valley floor by an attendant .
Now that is weird , right ?
Here is this mighty warrior challenging the Israelites to one-on-one combat .
Why is he being led by the hand by some young boy , presumably , to the point of combat ?
Secondly , the Bible story makes special note of how slowly Goliath moves , another odd thing to say when you &apos;re describing the mightiest warrior known to man at that point .
And then there &apos;s this whole weird thing about how long it takes Goliath to react to the sight of David .
So David &apos;s coming down the mountain , and he &apos;s clearly not preparing for hand-to-hand combat .
There is nothing about him that says , &quot; I am about to fight you like this . &quot;
He &apos;s not even carrying a sword .
Why does Goliath not react to that ?
It &apos;s as if he &apos;s oblivious to what &apos;s going on that day .
And then there &apos;s that strange comment he makes to David : &quot; Am I a dog that you should come to me with sticks ? &quot;
Sticks ? David only has one stick .
Well , it turns out that there &apos;s been a great deal of speculation within the medical community over the years about whether there is something fundamentally wrong with Goliath , an attempt to make sense of all of those apparent anomalies .
There have been many articles written .
The first one was in 1960 in the Indiana Medical Journal , and it started a chain of speculation that starts with an explanation for Goliath &apos;s height .
So Goliath is head and shoulders above all of his peers in that era , and usually when someone is that far out of the norm , there &apos;s an explanation for it .
So the most common form of giantism is a condition called acromegaly , and acromegaly is caused by a benign tumor on your pituitary gland that causes an overproduction of human growth hormone .
And throughout history , many of the most famous giants have all had acromegaly .
So the tallest person of all time was a guy named Robert Wadlow who was still growing when he died at the age of 24 and he was 8 foot 11 .
He had acromegaly .
Do you remember the wrestler André the Giant ?
Famous . He had acromegaly .
There &apos;s even speculation that Abraham Lincoln had acromegaly .
Anyone who &apos;s unusually tall , that &apos;s the first explanation we come up with .
And acromegaly has a very distinct set of side effects associated with it , principally having to do with vision .
The pituitary tumor , as it grows , often starts to compress the visual nerves in your brain , with the result that people with acromegaly have either double vision or they are profoundly nearsighted .
So when people have started to speculate about what might have been wrong with Goliath , they &apos;ve said , &quot; Wait a minute , he looks and sounds an awful lot like someone who has acromegaly . &quot;
And that would also explain so much of what was strange about his behavior that day .
Why does he move so slowly and have to be escorted down into the valley floor by an attendant ?
Because he can &apos;t make his way on his own .
Why is he so strangely oblivious to David that he doesn &apos;t understand that David &apos;s not going to fight him until the very last moment ?
Because he can &apos;t see him .
When he says , &quot; Come to me that I might feed your flesh to the birds of the heavens and the beasts of the field , &quot; the phrase &quot; come to me &quot; is a hint also of his vulnerability .
Come to me because I can &apos;t see you .
And then there &apos;s , &quot; Am I a dog that you should come to me with sticks ? &quot;
He sees two sticks when David has only one .
So the Israelites up on the mountain ridge looking down on him thought he was this extraordinarily powerful foe .
What they didn &apos;t understand was that the very thing that was the source of his apparent strength was also the source of his greatest weakness .
And there is , I think , in that , a very important lesson for all of us .
Giants are not as strong and powerful as they seem .
And sometimes the shepherd boy has a sling in his pocket .
Thank you .

&lt; title &gt; Malcolm Gladwell : The unheard story of David and Goliath &lt; / title &gt;
&lt; description &gt; It &apos;s a classic underdog tale : David , a young shepherd armed only with a sling , beats Goliath , the mighty warrior . The story has transcended its biblical origins to become a common shorthand for unlikely victory . But , asks Malcolm Gladwell , is that really what the David and Goliath story is about ? &lt; / description &gt;

&lt; url &gt; http : / / www.ted.com / talks / julian _ treasure _ the _ 4 _ ways _ sound _ affects _ us.html &lt; / url &gt;
Over the next five minutes , my intention is to transform your relationship with sound .
Let me start with the observation that most of the sound around us is accidental , and much of it is unpleasant .
We stand on street corners , shouting over noise like this , and pretending that it doesn &apos;t exist .
Well , this habit of suppressing sound has meant that our relationship with sound has become largely unconscious .
There are four major ways sound is affecting you all the time , and I &apos;d like to raise them in your consciousness today .
First is physiological .
Sorry about that . I &apos;ve just given you a shot of cortisol , your fight / flight hormone .
Sounds are affecting your hormone secretions all the time , but also your breathing , your heart rate -- which I just also did -- and your brainwaves .
It &apos;s not just unpleasant sounds like that that do it .
This is surf .
It has the frequency of roughly 12 cycles per minute .
Most people find that very soothing , and , interestingly , 12 cycles per minute is roughly the frequency of the breathing of a sleeping human .
There is a deep resonance with being at rest .
We also associate it with being stress-free and on holiday .
The second way in which sound affects you is psychological .
Music is the most powerful form of sound that we know that affects our emotional state .
This is guaranteed to make most of you feel pretty sad if I leave it on .
Music is not the only kind of sound , however , which affects your emotions .
Natural sound can do that too .
Birdsong , for example , is a sound which most people find reassuring .
There is a reason for that . Over hundreds of thousands of years we &apos;ve learned that when the birds are singing , things are safe .
It &apos;s when they stop you need to be worried .
The third way in which sound affects you is cognitively .
You can &apos;t understand two people talking at once or in this case one person talking twice .
Try and listen to the other one .
We have a very small amount of bandwidth for processing auditory input , which is why noise like this -- -- is extremely damaging for productivity .
If you have to work in an open-plan office like this , your productivity is greatly reduced .
And whatever number you &apos;re thinking of , it probably isn &apos;t as bad as this .
You are one third as productive in open-plan offices as in quiet rooms .
And I have a tip for you . If you have to work in spaces like that , carry headphones with you , with a soothing sound like birdsong .
Put them on and your productivity goes back up to triple what it would be .
The fourth way in which sound affects us is behaviorally .
With all that other stuff going on , it would be amazing if our behavior didn &apos;t change .
So , ask yourself : Is this person ever going to drive at a steady 28 miles per hour ? I don &apos;t think so .
At the simplest , you move away from unpleasant sound and towards pleasant sounds .
So if I were to play this -- -- for more than a few seconds , you &apos;d feel uncomfortable ; for more than a few minutes , you &apos;d be leaving the room in droves .
For people who can &apos;t get away from noise like that , it &apos;s extremely damaging for their health .
And that &apos;s not the only thing that bad sound damages .
Most retail sound is inappropriate and accidental , and even hostile , and it has a dramatic effect on sales .
For those of you who are retailers , you may want to look away before I show this slide .
They are losing up to 30 percent of their business with people leaving shops faster , or just turning around on the door .
We all have done it , leaving the area because the sound in there is so dreadful .
I want to spend just a moment talking about the model that we &apos;ve developed , which allows us to start at the top and look at the drivers of sound , analyze the soundscape and then predict the four outcomes I &apos;ve just talked about .
Or start at the bottom , and say what outcomes do we want , and then design a soundscape to have a desired effect .
At last we &apos;ve got some science we can apply .
And we &apos;re in the business of designing soundscapes .
Just a word on music . Music is the most powerful sound there is , often inappropriately deployed .
It &apos;s powerful for two reasons . You recognize it fast , and you associate it very powerfully .
I &apos;ll give you two examples .
Most of you recognize that immediately .
The younger , maybe not .
And most of you associate that with something !
Now , those are one-second samples of music .
Music is very powerful . And unfortunately it &apos;s veneering commercial spaces , often inappropriately .
I hope that &apos;s going to change over the next few years .
Let me just talk about brands for a moment , because some of you run brands . Every brand is out there making sound right now .
There are eight expressions of a brand in sound .
They are all important . And every brand needs to have guidelines at the center .
I &apos;m glad to say that is starting to happen now .
You all recognize that one . This is the most-played tune in the world today .
1.8 billion times a day , that tune is played .
And it cost Nokia absolutely nothing .
Just leave you with four golden rules , for those of you who run businesses , for commercial sound .
First , make it congruent , pointing in the same direction as your visual communication .
That increases impact by over 1,100 percent .
If your sound is pointing the opposite direction , incongruent , you reduce impact by 86 percent .
That &apos;s an order of magnitude , up or down .
This is important .
Secondly , make it appropriate to the situation .
Thirdly , make it valuable . Give people something with the sound .
Don &apos;t just bombard them with stuff .
And , finally , test and test it again .
Sound is complex . There are many countervailing influences .
It can be a bit like a bowl of spaghetti : sometimes you just have to eat it and see what happens .
So I hope this talk has raised sound in your consciousness .
If you &apos;re listening consciously , you can take control of the sound around you .
It &apos;s good for your health . It &apos;s good for your productivity .
If we all do that we move to a state that I like to think will be sound living in the world .
I &apos;m going to leave you with a little bit more birdsong .
I recommend at least five minutes a day , but there is no maximum dose .
Thank you for lending me your ears today .

&lt; url &gt; http : / / www.ted.com / talks / fiorenzo _ omenetto _ silk _ the _ ancient _ material _ of _ the _ future.html &lt; / url &gt;
Thank you .
I &apos;m thrilled to be here .
I &apos;m going to talk about a new , old material that still continues to amaze us , and that might impact the way we think about material science , high technology -- and maybe , along the way , also do some stuff for medicine and for global health and help reforestation .
So that &apos;s kind of a bold statement .
I &apos;ll tell you a little bit more .
This material actually has some traits that make it seem almost too good to be true .
It &apos;s sustainable ; it &apos;s a sustainable material that is processed all in water and at room temperature -- and is biodegradable with a clock , so you can watch it dissolve instantaneously in a glass of water or have it stable for years .
It &apos;s edible ; it &apos;s implantable in the human body without causing any immune response .
It actually gets reintegrated in the body .
And it &apos;s technological , so it can do things like microelectronics , and maybe photonics do .
And the material looks something like this .
In fact , this material you see is clear and transparent .
The components of this material are just water and protein .
So this material is silk .
So it &apos;s kind of different from what we &apos;re used to thinking about silk .
So the question is , how do you reinvent something that has been around for five millennia ?
The process of discovery , generally , is inspired by nature .
And so we marvel at silk worms -- the silk worm you see here spinning its fiber .
The silk worm does a remarkable thing : it uses these two ingredients , protein and water , that are in its gland , to make a material that is exceptionally tough for protection -- so comparable to technical fibers like Kevlar .
And so in the reverse engineering process that we know about , and that we &apos;re familiar with , for the textile industry , the textile industry goes and unwinds the cocoon and then weaves glamorous things .
We want to know how you go from water and protein to this liquid Kevlar , to this natural Kevlar .
So the insight is how do you actually reverse engineer this and go from cocoon to gland and get water and protein that is your starting material .
And this is an insight that came , about two decades ago , from a person that I &apos;m very fortunate to work with , David Kaplan .
And so we get this starting material .
And so this starting material is back to the basic building block .
And then we use this to do a variety of things -- like , for example , this film .
And we take advantage of something that is very simple .
The recipe to make those films is to take advantage of the fact that proteins are extremely smart at what they do .
They find their way to self-assemble .
So the recipe is simple : you take the silk solution , you pour it , and you wait for the protein to self-assemble .
And then you detach the protein and you get this film , as the proteins find each other as the water evaporates .
But I mentioned that the film is also technological .
And so what does that mean ?
It means that you can interface it with some of the things that are typical of technology , like microelectronics and nanoscale technology .
And the image of the DVD here is just to illustrate a point that silk follows very subtle topographies of the surface , which means that it can replicate features on the nanoscale .
So it would be able to replicate the information that is on the DVD .
And we can store information that &apos;s film with water and protein .
So we tried something out , and we wrote a message in a piece of silk , which is right here , and the message is over there .
And much like in the DVD , you can read it out optically .
And this requires a stable hand , so this is why I decided to do it onstage in front of a thousand people .
So let me see .
So as you see the film go in transparently through there , and then ...
And the most remarkable feat is that my hand actually stayed still long enough to do that .
So once you have these attributes of this material , then you can do a lot of things .
It &apos;s actually not limited to films .
And so the material can assume a lot of formats .
And then you go a little crazy , and so you do various optical components or you do microprism arrays , like the reflective tape that you have on your running shoes .
Or you can do beautiful things that , if the camera can capture , you can make .
You can add a third dimensionality to the film .
And if the angle is right , you can actually see a hologram appear in this film of silk .
But you can do other things .
You can imagine that then maybe you can use a pure protein to guide light , and so we &apos;ve made optical fibers .
But silk is versatile and it goes beyond optics .
And you can think of different formats .
So for instance , if you &apos;re afraid of going to the doctor and getting stuck with a needle , we do microneedle arrays .
What you see there on the screen is a human hair superimposed on the needle that &apos;s made of silk -- just to give you a sense of size .
You can do bigger things .
You can do gears and nuts and bolts -- that you can buy at Whole Foods .
And the gears work in water as well .
So you think of alternative mechanical parts .
And maybe you can use that liquid Kevlar if you need something strong to replace peripheral veins , for example , or maybe an entire bone .
And so you have here a little example of a small skull -- what we call mini Yorick .
But you can do things like cups , for example , and so , if you add a little bit of gold , if you add a little bit of semiconductors you could do sensors that stick on the surfaces of foods .
You can do electronic pieces that fold and wrap .
Or if you &apos;re fashion forward , some silk LED tattoos .
So there &apos;s versatility , as you see , in the material formats , that you can do with silk .
But there are still some unique traits .
I mean , why would you want to do all these things for real ?
I mentioned it briefly at the beginning ; the protein is biodegradable and biocompatible .
And you see here a picture of a tissue section .
And so what does that mean , that it &apos;s biodegradable and biocompatible ?
You can implant it in the body without needing to retrieve what is implanted .
Which means that all the devices that you &apos;ve seen before and all the formats , in principle , can be implanted and disappear .
And what you see there in that tissue section , in fact , is you see that reflector tape .
So , much like you &apos;re seen at night by a car , then the idea is that you can see , if you illuminate tissue , you can see deeper parts of tissue because there is that reflective tape there that is made out of silk .
And you see there , it gets reintegrated in tissue .
And reintegration in the human body is not the only thing , but reintegration in the environment is important .
So you have a clock , you have protein , and now a silk cup like this can be thrown away without guilt -- unlike the polystyrene cups that unfortunately fill our landfills everyday .
It &apos;s edible , so you can do smart packaging around food that you can cook with the food .
It doesn &apos;t taste good , so I &apos;m going to need some help with that .
But probably the most remarkable thing is that it comes full circle .
Silk , during its self-assembly process , acts like a cocoon for biological matter .
And so if you change the recipe , and you add things when you pour -- where these things are enzymes or antibodies or vaccines , the self-assembly process preserves the biological function of these dopants .
So it makes the materials environmentally active and interactive .
So that screw that you thought about beforehand can actually be used and deliver drugs at the same , while your bone is healing , for example .
Or you could put drugs in your wallet and not in your fridge .
So we &apos;ve made a silk card with penicillin in it .
And we stored penicillin at 60 degrees C , so 140 degrees Fahrenheit , for two months without loss of efficacy of the penicillin .
And so that could be --- that could be potentially a good alternative to solar powered refrigerated camels .
And of course , there &apos;s no use in storage if you can &apos;t use &#91; it &#93; .
And so there is this other unique material trait that these materials have , that they &apos;re programmably degradable .
And so what you see there is the difference .
In the top , you have a film that has been programmed not to degrade , and in the bottom , a film that has been programmed to degrade in water .
And what you see is that the film on the bottom releases what is inside it .
So it allows for the recovery of what we &apos;ve stored before .
And so this allows for a controlled delivery of drugs and for reintegration in the environment in all of these formats that you &apos;ve seen .
So the thread of discovery that we have really is a thread .
We &apos;re impassioned with this idea that whatever you want to do , whether you want to replace a vein or a bone , or maybe be more sustainable in microelectronics , perhaps drink a coffee in a cup and throw it away without guilt , maybe carry your drugs in your pocket , deliver them inside your body or deliver them across the desert , the answer may be in a thread of silk .
Thank you .

Imagine , if you will -- a gift .
I &apos;d like for you to picture it in your mind .
It &apos;s not too big -- about the size of a golf ball .
So envision what it looks like all wrapped up .
But before I show you what &apos;s inside , I will tell you , it &apos;s going to do incredible things for you .
It will bring all of your family together .
You will feel loved and appreciated like never before and reconnect with friends and acquaintances you haven &apos;t heard from in years .
Adoration and admiration will overwhelm you .
It will recalibrate what &apos;s most important in your life .
It will redefine your sense of spirituality and faith .
You &apos;ll have a new understanding and trust in your body .
You &apos;ll have unsurpassed vitality and energy .
You &apos;ll expand your vocabulary , meet new people , and you &apos;ll have a healthier lifestyle .
And get this -- you &apos;ll have an eight-week vacation of doing absolutely nothing .
You &apos;ll eat countless gourmet meals .
Flowers will arrive by the truckload .
People will say to you , &quot; You look great . Have you had any work done ? &quot;
And you &apos;ll have a lifetime supply of good drugs .
You &apos;ll be challenged , inspired , motivated and humbled .
Your life will have new meaning .
Peace , health , serenity , happiness , nirvana .
The price ?
$ 55,000 , and that &apos;s an incredible deal .
By now I know you &apos;re dying to know what it is and where you can get one .
Does Amazon carry it ?
Does it have the Apple logo on it ?
Is there a waiting list ?
Not likely .
This gift came to me about five months ago .
It looked more like this when it was all wrapped up -- not quite so pretty .
And this , and then this .
It was a rare gem -- a brain tumor , hemangioblastoma -- the gift that keeps on giving .
And while I &apos;m okay now , I wouldn &apos;t wish this gift for you .
I &apos;m not sure you &apos;d want it .
But I wouldn &apos;t change my experience .
It profoundly altered my life in ways I didn &apos;t expect in all the ways I just shared with you .
So the next time you &apos;re faced with something that &apos;s unexpected , unwanted and uncertain , consider that it just may be a gift .

&lt; url &gt; http : / / www.ted.com / talks / sylvia _ earle _ s _ ted _ prize _ wish _ to _ protect _ our _ oceans.html &lt; / url &gt;
Fifty years ago , when I began exploring the ocean , no one -- not Jacques Perrin , not Jacques Cousteau or Rachel Carson -- imagined that we could do anything to harm the ocean by what we put into it or by what we took out of it .
It seemed , at that time , to be a sea of Eden , but now we know , and now we are facing paradise lost .
I want to share with you my personal view of changes in the sea that affect all of us , and to consider why it matters that in 50 years , we &apos;ve lost -- actually , we &apos;ve taken , we &apos;ve eaten -- more than 90 percent of the big fish in the sea ; why you should care that nearly half of the coral reefs have disappeared ; why a mysterious depletion of oxygen in large areas of the Pacific should concern not only the creatures that are dying , but it really should concern you .
It does concern you , as well .
I &apos;m haunted by the thought of what Ray Anderson calls &quot; tomorrow &apos;s child , &quot; asking why we didn &apos;t do something on our watch to save sharks and bluefin tuna and squids and coral reefs and the living ocean while there still was time .
Well , now is that time .
I hope for your help to explore and protect the wild ocean in ways that will restore the health and , in so doing , secure hope for humankind .
Health to the ocean means health for us .
And I hope Jill Tarter &apos;s wish to engage Earthlings includes dolphins and whales and other sea creatures in this quest to find intelligent life elsewhere in the universe .
And I hope , Jill , that someday we will find evidence that there is intelligent life among humans on this planet .
Did I say that ? I guess I did .
For me , as a scientist , it all began in 1953 when I first tried scuba .
It &apos;s when I first got to know fish swimming in something other than lemon slices and butter .
I actually love diving at night ; you see a lot of fish then that you don &apos;t see in the daytime .
Diving day and night was really easy for me in 1970 , when I led a team of aquanauts living underwater for weeks at a time -- at the same time that astronauts were putting their footprints on the moon .
In 1979 I had a chance to put my footprints on the ocean floor while using this personal submersible called Jim .
It was six miles offshore and 1,250 feet down .
It &apos;s one of my favorite bathing suits .
Since then , I &apos;ve used about 30 kinds of submarines and I &apos;ve started three companies and a nonprofit foundation called Deep Search to design and build systems to access the deep sea .
I led a five-year National Geographic expedition , the Sustainable Seas expeditions , using these little subs .
They &apos;re so simple to drive that even a scientist can do it .
And I &apos;m living proof .
Astronauts and aquanauts alike really appreciate the importance of air , food , water , temperature -- all the things you need to stay alive in space or under the sea .
I heard astronaut Joe Allen explain how he had to learn everything he could about his life support system and then do everything he could to take care of his life support system ; and then he pointed to this and he said , &quot; Life support system . &quot;
We need to learn everything we can about it and do everything we can to take care of it .
The poet Auden said , &quot; Thousands have lived without love ; none without water . &quot;
Ninety-seven percent of Earth &apos;s water is ocean .
No blue , no green .
If you think the ocean isn &apos;t important , imagine Earth without it .
Mars comes to mind .
No ocean , no life support system .
I gave a talk not so long ago at the World Bank and I showed this amazing image of Earth and I said , &quot; There it is ! The World Bank ! &quot;
That &apos;s where all the assets are !
And we &apos;ve been trawling them down much faster than the natural systems can replenish them .
Tim Worth says the economy is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the environment .
With every drop of water you drink , every breath you take , you &apos;re connected to the sea .
No matter where on Earth you live .
Most of the oxygen in the atmosphere is generated by the sea .
Over time , most of the planet &apos;s organic carbon has been absorbed and stored there , mostly by microbes .
The ocean drives climate and weather , stabilizes temperature , shapes Earth &apos;s chemistry .
Water from the sea forms clouds that return to the land and the seas as rain , sleet and snow , and provides home for about 97 percent of life in the world , maybe in the universe .
No water , no life ; no blue , no green .
Yet we have this idea , we humans , that the Earth -- all of it : the oceans , the skies -- are so vast and so resilient it doesn &apos;t matter what we do to it .
That may have been true 10,000 years ago , and maybe even 1,000 years ago but in the last 100 , especially in the last 50 , we &apos;ve drawn down the assets , the air , the water , the wildlife that make our lives possible .
New technologies are helping us to understand the nature of nature ; the nature of what &apos;s happening , showing us our impact on the Earth .
I mean , first you have to know that you &apos;ve got a problem .
And fortunately , in our time , we &apos;ve learned more about the problems than in all preceding history .
And with knowing comes caring .
And with caring , there &apos;s hope that we can find an enduring place for ourselves within the natural systems that support us .
But first we have to know .
Three years ago , I met John Hanke , who &apos;s the head of Google Earth , and I told him how much I loved being able to hold the world in my hands and go exploring vicariously .
But I asked him : &quot; When are you going to finish it ?
You did a great job with the land , the dirt .
What about the water ? &quot;
Since then , I &apos;ve had the great pleasure of working with the Googlers , with DOER Marine , with National Geographic , with dozens of the best institutions and scientists around the world , ones that we could enlist , to put the ocean in Google Earth .
And as of just this week , last Monday , Google Earth is now whole .
Consider this : Starting right here at the convention center , we can find the nearby aquarium , we can look at where we &apos;re sitting , and then we can cruise up the coast to the big aquarium , the ocean , and California &apos;s four national marine sanctuaries , and the new network of state marine reserves that are beginning to protect and restore some of the assets We can flit over to Hawaii and see the real Hawaiian Islands : not just the little bit that pokes through the surface , but also what &apos;s below .
To see -- wait a minute , we can go kshhplash ! -- right there , ha -- under the ocean , see what the whales see .
We can go explore the other side of the Hawaiian Islands .
We can go actually and swim around on Google Earth and visit with humpback whales .
These are the gentle giants that I &apos;ve had the pleasure of meeting face to face many times underwater .
There &apos;s nothing quite like being personally inspected by a whale .
We can pick up and fly to the deepest place : seven miles down , the Mariana Trench , where only two people have ever been .
Imagine that . It &apos;s only seven miles , but only two people have been there , 49 years ago .
One-way trips are easy .
We need new deep-diving submarines .
How about some X Prizes for ocean exploration ?
We need to see deep trenches , the undersea mountains , and understand life in the deep sea .
We can now go to the Arctic .
Just ten years ago I stood on the ice at the North Pole .
An ice-free Arctic Ocean may happen in this century .
That &apos;s bad news for the polar bears .
That &apos;s bad news for us too .
Excess carbon dioxide is not only driving global warming , it &apos;s also changing ocean chemistry , making the sea more acidic .
That &apos;s bad news for coral reefs and oxygen-producing plankton .
Also it &apos;s bad news for us .
We &apos;re putting hundreds of millions of tons of plastic and other trash into the sea .
Millions of tons of discarded fishing nets , gear that continues to kill .
We &apos;re clogging the ocean , poisoning the planet &apos;s circulatory system , and we &apos;re taking out hundreds of millions of tons of wildlife , all carbon-based units .
Barbarically , we &apos;re killing sharks for shark fin soup , undermining food chains that shape planetary chemistry and drive the carbon cycle , the nitrogen cycle , the oxygen cycle , the water cycle -- our life support system .
We &apos;re still killing bluefin tuna ; truly endangered and much more valuable alive than dead .
All of these parts are part of our life support system .
We kill using long lines , with baited hooks every few feet that may stretch for 50 miles or more .
Industrial trawlers and draggers are scraping the sea floor like bulldozers , taking everything in their path .
Using Google Earth you can witness trawlers -- in China , the North Sea , the Gulf of Mexico -- shaking the foundation of our life support system , leaving plumes of death in their path .
The next time you dine on sushi -- or sashimi , or swordfish steak , or shrimp cocktail , whatever wildlife you happen to enjoy from the ocean -- think of the real cost .
For every pound that goes to market , more than 10 pounds , even 100 pounds , may be thrown away as bycatch .
This is the consequence of not knowing that there are limits to what we can take out of the sea .
This chart shows the decline in ocean wildlife from 1900 to 2000 .
The highest concentrations are in red .
In my lifetime , imagine , 90 percent of the big fish have been killed .
Most of the turtles , sharks , tunas and whales are way down in numbers .
But , there is good news .
Ten percent of the big fish still remain .
There are still some blue whales .
There are still some krill in Antarctica .
There are a few oysters in Chesapeake Bay .
Half the coral reefs are still in pretty good shape , a jeweled belt around the middle of the planet .
There &apos;s still time , but not a lot , to turn things around .
But business as usual means that in 50 years , there may be no coral reefs -- and no commercial fishing , because the fish will simply be gone .
Imagine the ocean without fish .
Imagine what that means to our life support system .
Natural systems on the land are in big trouble too , but the problems are more obvious , and some actions are being taken to protect trees , watersheds and wildlife .
And in 1872 , with Yellowstone National Park , the United States began establishing a system of parks that some say was the best idea America ever had .
About 12 percent of the land around the world is now protected : safeguarding biodiversity , providing a carbon sink , generating oxygen , protecting watersheds .
And , in 1972 , this nation began to establish a counterpart in the sea , National Marine Sanctuaries .
That &apos;s another great idea .
The good news is that there are now more than 4,000 places in the sea , around the world , that have some kind of protection .
And you can find them on Google Earth .
The bad news is that you have to look hard to find them .
In the last three years , for example , the U.S. protected 340,000 square miles of ocean as national monuments .
But it only increased from 0.6 of one percent to 0.8 of one percent of the ocean protected , globally .
Protected areas do rebound , but it takes a long time to restore 50-year-old rockfish or monkfish , sharks or sea bass , or 200-year-old orange roughy .
We don &apos;t consume 200-year-old cows or chickens .
Protected areas provide hope that the creatures of Ed Wilson &apos;s dream of an encyclopedia of life , or the census of marine life , will live not just as a list , a photograph , or a paragraph .
With scientists around the world , I &apos;ve been looking at the 99 percent of the ocean that is open to fishing -- and mining , and drilling , and dumping , and whatever -- to search out hope spots , and try to find ways to give them and us a secure future .
Such as the Arctic -- we have one chance , right now , to get it right .
Or the Antarctic , where the continent is protected , but the surrounding ocean is being stripped of its krill , whales and fish .
Sargasso Sea &apos;s three million square miles of floating forest is being gathered up to feed cows .
97 percent of the land in the Galapagos Islands is protected , but the adjacent sea is being ravaged by fishing .
It &apos;s true too in Argentina on the Patagonian shelf , which is now in serious trouble .
The high seas , where whales , tuna and dolphins travel -- the largest , least protected , ecosystem on Earth , filled with luminous creatures , living in dark waters that average two miles deep .
They flash , and sparkle , and glow with their own living light .
There are still places in the sea as pristine as I knew as a child .
The next 10 years may be the most important , and the next 10,000 years the best chance our species will have to protect what remains of the natural systems that give us life .
To cope with climate change , we need new ways to generate power .
We need new ways , better ways , to cope with poverty , wars and disease .
We need many things to keep and maintain the world as a better place .
But , nothing else will matter if we fail to protect the ocean .
Our fate and the ocean &apos;s are one .
We need to do for the ocean what Al Gore did for the skies above .
A global plan of action with a world conservation union , the IUCN , is underway to protect biodiversity , to mitigate and recover from the impacts of climate change , on the high seas and in coastal areas , wherever we can identify critical places .
New technologies are needed to map , photograph and explore the 95 percent of the ocean that we have yet to see .
The goal is to protect biodiversity , to provide stability and resilience .
We need deep-diving subs , new technologies to explore the ocean .
We need , maybe , an expedition -- a TED at sea -- that could help figure out the next steps .
And so , I suppose you want to know what my wish is .
I wish you would use all means at your disposal -- films , expeditions , the web , new submarines -- and campaign to ignite public support for a global network of marine protected areas -- hope spots large enough to save and restore the ocean , the blue heart of the planet .
How much ?
Some say 10 percent , some say 30 percent .
You decide : how much of your heart do you want to protect ?
Whatever it is , a fraction of one percent is not enough .
My wish is a big wish , but if we can make it happen , it can truly change the world , and help ensure the survival of what actually -- as it turns out -- is my favorite species ; that would be us .
For the children of today , for tomorrow &apos;s child : as never again , now is the time .
Thank you .

I and my colleagues Art Aron and Lucy Brown and others , have put 37 people who are madly in love into a functional MRI brain scanner .
17 who were happily in love , 15 who had just been dumped , and we &apos;re just starting our third experiment : studying people who report that they &apos;re still in love after 10 to 25 years of marriage .
So , this is the short story of that research .
In the jungles of Guatemala , in Tikal , stands a temple .
It was built by the grandest Sun King , of the grandest city-state , of the grandest civilization of the Americas , the Mayas .
His name was Jasaw Chan K &apos;awiil .
He stood over six feet tall .
He lived into his 80s , and he was buried beneath this monument in 720 AD .
And Mayan inscriptions proclaim that he was deeply in love with his wife .
So , he built a temple in her honor , facing his .
And every spring and autumn , exactly at the equinox , the sun rises behind his temple , and perfectly bathes her temple with his shadow .
And as the sun sets behind her temple in the afternoon , it perfectly bathes his temple with her shadow .
After 1,300 years , these two lovers still touch and kiss from their tomb .
Around the world , people love .
They sing for love , they dance for love , they compose poems and stories about love .
They tell myths and legends about love .
They pine for love , they live for love , they kill for love , and they die for love .
As Walt Whitman once said , he said , &quot; Oh , I would stake all for you . &quot;
Anthropologists have found evidence of romantic love in 170 societies .
They &apos;ve never found a society that did not have it .
But love isn &apos;t always a happy experience .
In one study of college students , they asked a lot of questions about love , but the two that stood out to me the most were , &quot; Have you ever been rejected by somebody who you really loved ? &quot;
And the second question was , &quot; Have you ever dumped somebody who really loved you ? &quot;
And almost 95 percent of both men and women said yes to both .
Almost nobody gets out of love alive .
So , before I start telling you about the brain , I want to read for you what I think is the most powerful love poem on Earth .
There &apos;s other love poems that are , of course , just as good , but I don &apos;t think this one can be surpassed .
It was told by an anonymous Kwakiutl Indian of southern Alaska to a missionary in 1896 , and here it is .
I &apos;ve never had the opportunity to say it before .
&quot; Fire runs through my body with the pain of loving you .
Pain runs through my body with the fires of my love for you .
Pain like a boil about to burst with my love for you , consumed by fire with my love for you .
I remember what you said to me .
I am thinking of your love for me .
I am torn by your love for me .
Pain and more pain -- where are you going with my love ?
I am told you will go from here .
I am told you will leave me here .
My body is numb with grief .
Remember what I said , my love .
Goodbye , my love , goodbye . &quot;
Emily Dickinson once wrote , &quot; Parting is all we need to know of hell . &quot;
How many people have suffered in all the millions of years of human evolution ?
How many people around the world are dancing with elation at this very minute ?
Romantic love is one of the most powerful sensations on Earth .
So , several years ago , I decided to look into the brain and study this madness .
Our first study of people who were happily in love has been widely publicized , so I &apos;m only going to say a very little about it .
We found activity in a tiny , little factory near the base of the brain called the ventral tegmental area .
We found activity in some cells called the A10 cells , cells that actually make dopamine , a natural stimulant , and spray it to many brain regions .
Indeed , this part , the VTA , is part of the brain &apos;s reward system .
It &apos;s way below your cognitive thinking process .
It &apos;s below your emotions .
It &apos;s part of what we call the reptilian core of the brain , associated with wanting , with motivation , with focus and with craving .
In fact , the same brain region where we found activity becomes active also when you feel the rush of cocaine .
But romantic love is much more than a cocaine high -- at least you come down from cocaine .
Romantic love is an obsession . It possesses you .
You lose your sense of self .
You can &apos;t stop thinking about another human being .
Somebody is camping in your head .
As an eighth-century Japanese poet said , &quot; My longing had no time when it ceases . &quot;
Wild is love .
And the obsession can get worse when you &apos;ve been rejected .
So , right now , Lucy Brown and I , the neuroscientist on our project , are looking at the data of the people who were put into the machine after they had just been dumped .
It was very difficult actually , putting these people in the machine , because they were in such bad shape .
So anyway , we found activity in three brain regions .
We found activity in the brain region , in exactly the same brain region associated with intense romantic love .
What a bad deal .
You know , when you &apos;ve been dumped , the one thing you love to do is just forget about this human being , and then go on with your life -- but no , you just love them harder .
As the poet Terence , the Roman poet once said , he said , &quot; The less my hope , the hotter my love . &quot;
And indeed , we now know why .
Two thousand years later , we can explain this in the brain .
That brain system -- the reward system for wanting , for motivation , for craving , for focus -- becomes more active when you can &apos;t get what you want .
In this case , life &apos;s greatest prize : an appropriate mating partner .
We found activity in other brain regions also -- in a brain region associated with calculating gains and losses .
You know , you &apos;re lying there , you &apos;re looking at the picture , and you &apos;re in this machine , and you &apos;re calculating , you know , what went wrong .
How , you know , what have I lost ?
As a matter of fact , Lucy and I have a little joke about this .
It comes from a David Mamet play , and there &apos;s two con artists in the play , and the woman is conning the man , and the man looks at the woman and says , &quot; Oh , you &apos;re a bad pony , I &apos;m not going to bet on you . &quot;
And indeed , it &apos;s this part of the brain , as you &apos;re measuring your gains and losses .
It &apos;s also the brain region that becomes active when you &apos;re willing to take enormous risks for huge gains and huge losses .
Last but not least , we found activity in a brain region associated with deep attachment to another individual .
No wonder people suffer around the world , and we have so many crimes of passion .
When you &apos;ve been rejected in love , not only are you engulfed with feelings of romantic love , but you &apos;re feeling deep attachment to this individual .
Moreover , this brain circuit for reward is working , and you &apos;re feeling intense energy , intense focus , intense motivation and the willingness to risk it all to win life &apos;s greatest prize .
So , what have I learned from this experiment that I would like to tell the world ?
Foremost , I have come to think that romantic love is a drive , a basic mating drive .
Not the sex drive -- the sex drive gets you out there , looking for a whole range of partners .
Romantic love enables you to focus your mating energy on just one at a time , conserve your mating energy , and start the mating process with this single individual .
I think of all the poetry that I &apos;ve read about romantic love , what sums it up best is something that is said by Plato , over 2,000 years ago .
He said , &quot; The god of love lives in a state of need .
It is a need . It is an urge .
It is a homeostatic imbalance .
Like hunger and thirst , it &apos;s almost impossible to stamp out . &quot;
I &apos;ve also come to believe that romantic love is an addiction : a perfectly wonderful addiction when it &apos;s going well , and a perfectly horrible addiction when it &apos;s going poorly .
And indeed , it has all of the characteristics of addiction .
You focus on the person , you obsessively think about them , you crave them , you distort reality , your willingness to take enormous risks to win this person .
And it &apos;s got the three main characteristics of addiction : tolerance , you need to see them more , and more , and more ; withdrawals ; and last , relapse .
I &apos;ve got a girlfriend who &apos;s just getting over a terrible love affair .
It &apos;s been about eight months , she &apos;s beginning to feel better .
And she was driving along in her car the other day , and suddenly she heard a song on the car radio that reminded her of this man .
And she -- not only did the instant craving come back , but she had to pull over from the side of the road and cry .
So , one thing I would like the medical community , and the legal community , and even the college community , to see if they can understand , that indeed , romantic love is one of the most addictive substances on Earth .
I would also like to tell the world that animals love .
There &apos;s not an animal on this planet that will copulate with anything that comes along .
Too old , too young , too scruffy , too stupid , and they won &apos;t do it .
Unless you &apos;re stuck in a laboratory cage -- and you know , if you spend your entire life in a little box , you &apos;re not going to be as picky about who you have sex with -- but I &apos;ve looked in a hundred species , and everywhere in the wild , animals have favorites .
As a matter of fact ethologists know this .
There are over eight words for what they call &quot; animal favoritism : &quot; selective proceptivity , mate choice , female choice , sexual choice .
And indeed , there are now three academic articles in which they &apos;ve looked at this attraction , which may only last for a second , but it &apos;s a definite attraction , and either this same brain region , this reward system , or the chemicals of that reward system are involved .
In fact , I think animal attraction can be instant -- you can see an elephant instantly go for another elephant .
And I think that this is really the origin of what you and I call &quot; love at first sight . &quot;
People have often asked me whether what I know about love has spoiled it for me .
And I just simply say , &quot; Hardly . &quot;
You can know every single ingredient in a piece of chocolate cake , and then when you sit down and eat that cake , you can still feel that joy .
And certainly , I make all the same mistakes that everybody else does too , but it &apos;s really deepened my understanding and compassion , really , for all human life .
As a matter of fact , in New York , I often catch myself looking in baby carriages and feeling a little sorry for the tot .
for the chicken on my dinner plate , when I think of how intense this brain system is .
Our newest experiment has been hatched by my colleague , Art Aron -- putting people who are reporting that they are still in love , in a long-term relationship , into the functional MRI .
We &apos;ve put five people in so far , and indeed , we found exactly the same thing . They &apos;re not lying .
The brain areas associated with intense romantic love still become active , 25 years later .
There are still many questions to be answered and asked about romantic love .
The question that I &apos;m working on right this minute -- and I &apos;m only going to say it for a second , and then end -- is , why do you fall in love with one person , rather than another ?
I never would have even thought to think of this , but Match.com , the Internet-dating site , came to me three years ago and asked me that question .
And I said , I don &apos;t know .
I know what happens in the brain , when you do become in love , but I don &apos;t know why you fall in love with one person rather than another .
And so , I &apos;ve spent the last three years on this .
And there are many reasons that you fall in love with one person rather than another , that psychologists can tell you .
And we tend to fall in love with somebody from the same socioeconomic background , the same general level of intelligence , the same general level of good looks , the same religious values .
Your childhood certainly plays a role , but nobody knows how .
And that &apos;s about it , that &apos;s all they know .
No , they &apos;ve never found the way two personalities fit together to make a good relationship .
So , it began to occur to me that maybe your biology pulls you towards some people rather than another .
And I have concocted a questionnaire to see to what degree you express dopamine , serotonin , estrogen and testosterone .
I think we &apos;ve evolved four very broad personality types associated with the ratios of these four chemicals in the brain .
And on this dating site that I have created , called Chemistry.com , I ask you first a series of questions to see to what degree you express these chemicals , and I &apos;m watching who chooses who to love .
And 3.7 million people have taken the questionnaire in America .
About 600,000 people have taken it in 33 other countries .
I &apos;m putting the data together now , and at some point -- there will always be magic to love , but I think I will come closer to understanding why it is you can walk into a room and everybody is from your background , your same general level of intelligence , your same general level of good looks , and you don &apos;t feel pulled towards all of them .
I think there &apos;s biology to that .
I think we &apos;re going to end up , in the next few years , to understand all kinds of brain mechanisms that pull us to one person rather than another .
So , I will close with this . These are my older people .
Faulkner once said , &quot; The past is not dead , it &apos;s not even the past . &quot;
Indeed , we carry a lot of luggage from our yesteryear in the human brain .
And so , there &apos;s one thing that makes me pursue my understanding of human nature , and this reminds me of it .
These are two women .
Women tend to get intimacy differently than men do .
Women get intimacy from face-to-face talking .
We swivel towards each other , we do what we call the &quot; anchoring gaze &quot; and we talk .
This is intimacy to women .
I think it comes from millions of years of holding that baby in front of your face , cajoling it , reprimanding it , educating it with words .
Men tend to get intimacy from side-by-side doing .
As soon as one guy looks up , the other guy will look away .
I think it comes from millions of years of standing behind that -- sitting behind the bush , looking straight ahead , trying to hit that buffalo on the head with a rock .
I think , for millions of years , men faced their enemies , they sat side by side with friends .
So my final statement is : love is in us .
It &apos;s deeply embedded in the brain .
Our challenge is to understand each other . Thank you .

&lt; description &gt; Why do we crave love so much , even to the point that we would die for it ? To learn more about our very real , very physical need for romantic love , Helen Fisher and her research team took MRIs of people in love -- and people who had just been dumped . &lt; / description &gt;

I am the daughter of a forger , not just any forger ...
When you hear the word &quot; forger , &quot; you often understand &quot; mercenary . &quot;
You understand &quot; forged currency , &quot; &quot; forged pictures . &quot;
My father is no such man .
For 30 years of his life , he made false papers -- never for himself , always for other people , and to come to the aid of the persecuted and the oppressed .
Let me introduce him .
Here is my father at age 19 .
It all began for him during World War II , when at age 17 he found himself thrust into a forged documents workshop .
He quickly became the false papers expert of the Resistance .
And it &apos;s not a banal story -- after the liberation he continued to make false papers until the &apos; 70s .
When I was a child I knew nothing about this , of course .
This is me in the middle making faces .
I grew up in the Paris suburbs and I was the youngest of three children .
I had a &quot; normal &quot; dad like everybody else , apart from the fact that he was 30 years older than ...
well , he was basically old enough to be my grandfather .
Anyway , he was a photographer and a street educator , and he always taught us to obey the law very strictly .
And , of course , he never talked about his past life when he was a forger .
There was , however , an incident I &apos;m going to tell you about , that perhaps could have led me suspect something .
I was in high school and got a bad grade , a rare event for me , so I decided to hide it from my parents .
In order to do that , I set out to forge their signature .
I started working on my mother &apos;s signature , because my father &apos;s is absolutely impossible to forge .
So , I got working . I took some sheets of paper and started practicing , practicing , practicing , until I reached what I thought was a steady hand , and went into action .
Later , while checking my school bag , my mother got hold of my school assignment and immediately saw that the signature was forged .
She yelled at me like she never had before .
I went to hide in my bedroom , under the blankets , and then I waited for my father to come back from work with , one could say , much apprehension .
I heard him come in .
I remained under the blankets . He entered my room , sat on the corner of the bed , and he was silent , so I pulled the blanket from my head , and when he saw me he started laughing .
He was laughing so hard , he could not stop and he was holding my assignment in his hand .
Then he said , &quot; But really , Sarah , you could have worked harder ! Can &apos;t you see it &apos;s really too small ? &quot;
Indeed , it &apos;s rather small .
I was born in Algeria .
There I would hear people say my father was a &quot; moudjahid &quot; and that means &quot; fighter . &quot;
Later on , in France , I loved eavesdropping on grownups &apos; conversations , and I would hear all sorts of stories about my father &apos;s previous life , especially that he had &quot; done &quot; World War II , that he had &quot; done &quot; the Algerian war .
And in my head I would be thinking that &quot; doing &quot; a war meant being a soldier .
But knowing my father , and how he kept saying that he was a pacifist and non-violent , I found it very hard to picture him with a helmet and gun .
And indeed , I was very far from the mark .
One day , while my father was working on a file for us to obtain French nationality , I happened to see some documents that caught my attention .
These are real !
These are mine , I was born an Argentinean .
But the document I happened to see that would help us build a case for the authorities was a document from the army that thanked my father for his work on behalf of the secret services .
And then , suddenly , I went &quot; wow ! &quot;
My father , a secret agent ?
It was very James Bond .
I wanted to ask him questions , which he didn &apos;t answer .
And later , I told myself that one day I would have to question him .
And then I became a mother and had a son , and finally decided it was time -- that he absolutely had to talk to us .
I had become a mother and he was celebrating his 77th birthday , and suddenly I was very , very afraid .
I feared he &apos;d go and take his silences with him , and take his secrets with him .
I managed to convince him that it was important for us , but possibly also for other people that he shared his story .
He decided to tell it to me and I made a book , from which I &apos;m going to read you some excerpts later .
So , his story . My father was born in Argentina .
His parents were of Russian descent .
The whole family came to settle in France in the &apos; 30s .
His parents were Jewish , Russian and above all , very poor .
So at the age of 14 my father had to work .
And with his only diploma , his primary education certificate , he found himself working at a dyer - dry cleaner .
That &apos;s where he discovered something totally magical , and when he talks about it , it &apos;s fascinating -- it &apos;s the magic of dyeing chemistry .
During that time the war was happening and his mother was killed when he was 15 .
This coincided with the time when he threw himself body and soul into chemistry because it was the only consolation for his sadness .
All day he would ask many questions to his boss to learn , to accumulate more and more knowledge , and at night , when no one was looking , he &apos;d put his experience to practice .
He was mostly interested in ink bleaching .
All this to tell you that if my father became a forger , actually , it was almost by accident .
His family was Jewish , so they were hounded .
Finally they were all arrested and taken to the Drancy camp and they managed to get out at the last minute thanks to their Argentinean papers .
Well , they were out , but they were always in danger . The big &quot; Jew &quot; stamp was still on their papers .
It was my grandfather who decided they needed false documents .
My father had been instilled with such respect for the law that although he was being persecuted , he &apos;d never thought of false papers .
But it was he who went to meet a man from the Resistance .
In those times documents had hard covers , they were filled in by hand , and they stated your job .
In order to survive , he needed to be working . He asked the man to write &quot; dyer . &quot;
Suddenly the man looked very , very interested .
As a &quot; dyer , &quot; do you know how to bleach ink marks ?
Of course he knew .
And suddenly the man started explaining that actually the whole Resistance had a huge problem : even the top experts could not manage to bleach an ink , called &quot; indelible , &quot; the &quot; Waterman &quot; blue ink .
And my father immediately replied that he knew exactly how to bleach it .
Now , of course , the man was very impressed with this young man of 17 who could immediately give him the formula , so he recruited him .
And actually , without knowing it , my father had invented something we can find in every schoolchild &apos;s pencil case : the so-called &quot; correction pen . &quot;
But it was only the beginning .
That &apos;s my father .
As soon as he got to the lab , even though he was the youngest , he immediately saw that there was a problem with the making of forged documents .
All the movements stopped at falsifying .
But demand was ever-growing and it was difficult to tamper with existing documents .
He told himself it was necessary to make them from scratch .
He started a press . He started photoengraving .
He started making rubber stamps .
He started inventing all kind of things -- with some materials he invented a centrifuge using a bicycle wheel .
Anyway , he had to do all this because he was completely obsessed with output .
He had made a simple calculation : In one hour he could make 30 forged documents .
If he slept one hour , 30 people would die .
This sense of responsibility for other people &apos;s lives when he was just 17 -- and also his guilt for being a survivor , since he had escaped the camp when his friends had not -- stayed with him all his life .
And this is maybe what explains why , for 30 years , he continued to make false papers at the expense of all kinds of sacrifices .
I &apos;d like to talk about those sacrifices , because there were many .
There were obviously financial sacrifices because he always refused to be paid .
To him , being paid would have meant being a mercenary .
If he had accepted payment , he wouldn &apos;t be able to say &quot; yes &quot; or &quot; no &quot; depending on what he deemed a just or unjust cause .
So he was a photographer by day , and a forger by night for 30 years .
He was broke all of the time .
Then there were the emotional sacrifices : How can one live with a woman while having so many secrets ?
How can one explain what one does at night in the lab , every single night ?
Of course , there was another kind of sacrifice involving his family that I understood much later .
One day my father introduced me to my sister .
He also explained to me that I had a brother , too , and the first time I saw them I must have been three or four , and they were 30 years older than me .
They are both in their sixties now .
In order to write the book , I asked my sister questions . I wanted to know who my father was , who was the father she had known .
She explained that the father that she &apos;d had would tell them he &apos;d come and pick them up on Sunday to go for a walk .
They would get all dressed up and wait for him , but he would almost never come .
He &apos;d say , &quot; I &apos;ll call . &quot; He wouldn &apos;t call .
And then he would not come .
Then one day he totally disappeared .
Time passed , and they thought he had surely forgotten them , at first .
Then as time passed , at the end of almost two years , they thought , &quot; Well , perhaps our father has died . &quot;
And then I understood that asking my father so many questions was stirring up a whole past he probably didn &apos;t feel like talking about because it was painful .
And while my half brother and sister thought they &apos;d been abandoned , orphaned , my father was making false papers .
And if he did not tell them , it was of course to protect them .
After the liberation he made false papers to allow the survivors of concentration camps to immigrate to Palestine before the creation of Israel .
And then , as he was a staunch anti-colonialist , he made false papers for Algerians during the Algerian war .
After the Algerian war , at the heart of the international resistance movements , his name circulated and the whole world came knocking at his door .
In Africa there were countries fighting for their independence : Guinea , Guinea-Bissau , Angola .
And then my father connected with Nelson Mandela &apos;s anti-apartheid party .
He made false papers for persecuted black South Africans .
There was also Latin America .
My father helped those who resisted dictatorships in the Dominican Republic , Haiti , and then it was the turn of Brazil , Argentina , Venezuela , El Salvador , Nicaragua , Colombia , Peru , Uruguay , Chile and Mexico .
Then there was the Vietnam War .
My father made false papers for the American deserters who did not wish to take up arms against the Vietnamese .
Europe was not spared either .
My father made false papers for the dissidents against Franco in Spain , Salazar in Portugal , against the colonels &apos; dictatorship in Greece , and even in France .
There , just once , it happened in May of 1968 .
My father watched , benevolently , of course , the demonstrations of the month of May , but his heart was elsewhere , and so was his time because he had over 15 countries to serve .
Once , though , he agreed to make false papers for someone you might recognize .
He was much younger in those days , and my father agreed to make false papers to enable him to come back and speak at a meeting .
He told me that those false papers were the most media-relevant and the least useful he &apos;d had to make in all his life .
But , he agreed to do it , even though Daniel Cohn-Bendit &apos;s life was not in danger , just because it was a good opportunity to mock the authorities , and to show them that there &apos;s nothing more porous than borders -- and that ideas have no borders .
All my childhood , while my friends &apos; dads would tell them Grimm &apos;s fairy tales , my father would tell me stories about very unassuming heroes with unshakeable utopias who managed to make miracles .
And those heroes did not need an army behind them .
Anyhow , nobody would have followed them , except for a handful &#91; of &#93; men and women of conviction and courage .
I understood much later that actually it was his own story my father would tell me to get me to sleep .
I asked him whether , considering the sacrifices he had to make , he ever had any regrets .
He said no .
He told me that he would have been unable to witness or submit to injustice without doing anything .
He was persuaded , and he &apos;s still convinced that another world is possible -- a world where no one would ever need a forger .
He &apos;s still dreaming about it .
My father is here in the room today .
His name is Adolfo Kaminsky and I &apos;m going to ask him to stand up .
Thank you .

I &apos;ll tell you a little bit about irrational behavior .
Not yours , of course -- other people &apos;s .
So after being at MIT for a few years , I realized that writing academic papers is not that exciting .
You know , I don &apos;t know how many of those you read , but it &apos;s not fun to read and often not fun to write -- even worse to write .
So I decided to try and write something more fun .
And I came up with an idea that I will write a cookbook .
&quot; Dining Without Crumbs : The Art of Eating Over the Sink . &quot;
And it was going to be a look at life through the kitchen .
And I was quite excited about this . I was going to talk a little bit about research , a little bit about the kitchen .
You know , we do so much in the kitchen I thought this would be interesting .
And I wrote a couple of chapters .
And I took it to MIT press and they said , &quot; Cute , but not for us . Go and find somebody else . &quot;
I tried other people and everybody said the same thing , &quot; Cute . Not for us . &quot;
Until somebody said , &quot; Look , if you &apos;re serious about this , you first have to write a book about your research . You have to publish something , and then you &apos;ll get the opportunity to write something else .
If you really want to do it you have to do it . &quot;
So I said , &quot; You know , I really don &apos;t want to write about my research .
I do this all day long . I want to write something else .
Something a bit more free , less constrained . &quot;
And this person was very forceful and said , &quot; Look . That &apos;s the only way you &apos;ll ever do it . &quot;
So I said , &quot; Okay , if I have to do it -- &quot; I had a sabbatical . I said , &quot; I &apos;ll write about my research if there is no other way . And then I &apos;ll get to do my cookbook . &quot;
So I wrote a book on my research .
And it turned out to be quite fun in two ways .
First of all , I enjoyed writing .
But the more interesting thing was that I started learning from people .
It &apos;s a fantastic time to write , because there is so much feedback you can get from people .
People write me about their personal experience , and about their examples , and what they disagree , and nuances .
And even being here -- I mean the last few days , I &apos;ve known really heights of obsessive behavior I never thought about .
Which I think is just fascinating .
I will tell you a little bit about irrational behavior .
And I want to start by giving you some examples of visual illusion as a metaphor for rationality .
So think about these two tables .
And you must have seen this illusion .
If I asked you what &apos;s longer , the vertical line on the table on the left , or the horizontal line on the table on the right ?
Which one seems longer ?
Can anybody see anything but the left one being longer ?
No , right ? It &apos;s impossible .
But the nice thing about visual illusion is we can easily demonstrate mistakes .
So I can put some lines on ; it doesn &apos;t help .
I can animate the lines .
And to the extent you believe I didn &apos;t shrink the lines , which I didn &apos;t , I &apos;ve proven to you that your eyes were deceiving you .
Now , the interesting thing about this is when I take the lines away , it &apos;s as if you haven &apos;t learned anything in the last minute .
You can &apos;t look at this and say , &quot; Okay now I see reality as it is . &quot;
Right ? It &apos;s impossible to overcome this sense that this is indeed longer .
Our intuition is really fooling us in a repeatable , predictable , consistent way .
And there is almost nothing we can do about it , aside from taking a ruler and starting to measure it .
Here is another one -- this is one of my favorite illusions .
What do you see the color that top arrow is pointing to ?
Brown . Thank you .
The bottom one ? Yellow .
Turns out they &apos;re identical .
Can anybody see them as identical ?
Very very hard .
I can cover the rest of the cube up .
And if I cover the rest of the cube you can see that they are identical .
And if you don &apos;t believe me you can get the slide later and do some arts and crafts and see that they &apos;re identical .
But again it &apos;s the same story that if we take the background away , the illusion comes back . Right .
There is no way for us not to see this illusion .
I guess maybe if you &apos;re colorblind I don &apos;t think you can see that .
I want you to think about illusion as a metaphor .
Vision is one of the best things we do .
We have a huge part of our brain dedicated to vision -- bigger than dedicated to anything else .
We do more vision more hours of the day than we do anything else .
And we are evolutionarily designed to do vision .
And if we have these predictable repeatable mistakes in vision , which we &apos;re so good at , what &apos;s the chance that we don &apos;t make even more mistakes in something we &apos;re not as good at -- for example , financial decision making : something we don &apos;t have an evolutionary reason to do , we don &apos;t have a specialized part of the brain , and we don &apos;t do that many hours of the day .
And the argument is in those cases it might be the issue that we actually make many more mistakes and , worse , not have an easy way to see them .
Because in visual illusions we can easily demonstrate the mistakes ; in cognitive illusion it &apos;s much , much harder to demonstrate to people the mistakes .
So I want to show you some cognitive illusions , or decision-making illusions , in the same way .
And this is one of my favorite plots in social sciences .
It &apos;s from a paper by Johnson and Goldstein .
And it basically shows the percentage of people who indicated they would be interested in giving their organs to donation .
And these are different countries in Europe . And you basically see two types of countries : countries on the right , that seem to be giving a lot ; and countries on the left that seem to giving very little , or much less .
The question is , why ? Why do some countries give a lot and some countries give a little ?
When you ask people this question , they usually think that it has to be something about culture .
Right ? How much do you care about people ?
Giving your organs to somebody else is probably about how much you care about society , how linked you are .
Or maybe it is about religion .
But , if you look at this plot , you can see that countries that we think about as very similar actually exhibit very different behavior .
For example , Sweden is all the way on the right , and Denmark , that we think is culturally very similar , is all the way on the left .
Germany is on the left . And Austria is on the right .
The Netherlands is on the left . And Belgium is on the right .
And finally , depending on your particular version of European similarity , you can think about the U.K and France as either similar culturally or not .
But it turns out that from organ donation they are very different .
By the way , the Netherlands is an interesting story .
You see the Netherlands is kind of the biggest of the small group .
Turns out that they got to 28 percent after mailing every household in the country a letter begging people to join this organ donation program .
You know the expression , &quot; Begging only gets you so far &quot; ?
It &apos;s 28 percent in organ donation .
But whatever the countries on the right are doing they are doing a much better job than begging .
So what are they doing ?
Turns out the secret has to do with a form at the DMV .
And here is the story .
The countries on the left have a form at the DMV that looks something like this .
Check the box below if you want to participate in the organ donor program .
And what happens ?
People don &apos;t check , and they don &apos;t join .
The countries on the right , the ones that give a lot , have a slightly different form .
It says check the box below if you don &apos;t want to participate .
Interestingly enough , when people get this , they again don &apos;t check -- but now they join .
Now think about what this means .
We wake up in the morning and we feel we make decisions .
We wake up in the morning and we open the closet and we feel that we decide what to wear .
And we open the refrigerator and we feel that we decide what to eat .
What this is actually saying is that much of these decisions are not residing within us .
They are residing in the person who is designing that form .
When you walk into the DMV , the person who designed the form will have a huge influence on what you &apos;ll end up doing .
Now it &apos;s also very hard to intuit these results . Think about it for yourself .
How many of you believe that if you went to renew your license tomorrow , and you went to the DMV , and you would encounter one of these forms , that it would actually change your own behavior ?
Very , very hard to think that you will influence us .
We can say , &quot; Oh , these funny Europeans , of course it would influence them . &quot;
But when it comes to us , we have such a feeling that we are at the driver &apos;s seat , we have such a feeling that we are in control , and we are making the decision , that it &apos;s very hard to even accept the idea that we actually have an illusion of making a decision , rather than an actual decision .
Now , you might say , &quot; These are decisions we don &apos;t care about . &quot;
In fact , by definition , these are decisions about something that will happen to us after we die .
How could we care about something less than something that happens after we die ?
So a standard economist , someone who believes in rationality , would say , &quot; You know what ? The cost of lifting the pencil and marking a V is higher than the possible benefit of the decision , so that &apos;s why we get this effect . &quot;
But , in fact , it &apos;s not because it &apos;s easy .
It &apos;s not because it &apos;s trivial . It &apos;s not because we don &apos;t care .
It &apos;s the opposite . It &apos;s because we care .
It &apos;s difficult and it &apos;s complex .
And it &apos;s so complex that we don &apos;t know what to do .
And because we have no idea what to do we just pick whatever it was that was chosen for us .
I &apos;ll give you one more example for this .
This is from a paper by Redelmeier and Schaefer .
And they said , &quot; Well , this effect also happens to experts , people who are well-paid , experts in their decisions , do it a lot . &quot;
And they basically took a group of physicians .
And they presented to them a case study of a patient .
Here is a patient . He is a 67-year-old farmer .
He &apos;s been suffering from a right hip pain for a while .
And then they said to the physician , &quot; You decided a few weeks ago that nothing is working for this patient .
All these medications , nothing seems to be working .
So you refer the patient to hip replacement therapy .
Hip replacement . Okay ? &quot;
So the patient is on a path to have his hip replaced .
And then they said to half the physicians , they said , &quot; Yesterday you reviewed the patient &apos;s case and you realized that you forgot to try one medication .
You did not try ibuprofen .
What do you do ? Do you pull the patient back and try ibuprofen ?
Or do you let them go and have hip replacement ? &quot;
Well the good news is that most physicians in this case decided to pull the patient and try the ibuprofen .
Very good for the physicians .
The other group of the physicians , they said , &quot; Yesterday when you reviewed the case you discovered there were two medications you didn &apos;t try out yet , ibuprofen and piroxicam . &quot;
And they said , &quot; You have two medications you didn &apos;t try out yet . What do you do ?
You let them go . Or you pull them back .
And if you pull them back do you try ibuprofen or piroxicam ? Which one ? &quot;
Now think of it . This decision makes it as easy to let the patient continue with hip replacement .
But pulling them back , all of the sudden becomes more complex .
There is one more decision .
What happens now ?
Majority of the physicians now choose to let the patient go to hip replacement .
I hope this worries you , by the way -- when you go to see your physician .
The thing is is that no physician would ever say , &quot; Piroxicam , ibuprofen , hip replacement .
Let &apos;s go for hip replacement . &quot;
But the moment you set this as the default it has a huge power over whatever people end up doing .
I &apos;ll give you a couple of more examples on irrational decision-making .
Imagine I give you a choice .
Do you want to go for a weekend to Rome ?
All expenses paid : hotel , transportation , food , breakfast , a continental breakfast , everything .
Or a weekend in Paris ?
Now , a weekend in Paris , a weekend in Rome , these are different things ; they have different food , different culture , different art .
Now imagine I added a choice to the set that nobody wanted .
Imagine I said , &quot; A weekend in Rome , a weekend in Paris , or having your car stolen ? &quot;
It &apos;s a funny idea , because why would having your car stolen , in this set , influence anything ?
But what if the option to have your car stolen was not exactly like this .
What if it was a trip to Rome , all expenses paid , transportation , breakfast , but doesn &apos;t include coffee in the morning .
If you want coffee you have to pay for it yourself . It &apos;s two euros 50 .
Now in some ways , given that you can have Rome with coffee , why would you possibly want Rome without coffee ?
It &apos;s like having your car stolen . It &apos;s an inferior option .
But guess what happened . The moment you add Rome without coffee , Rome with coffee becomes more popular . And people choose it .
The fact that you have Rome without coffee makes Rome with coffee look superior , and not just to Rome without coffee -- even superior to Paris .
Here are two examples of this principle .
This was an ad from The Economist a few years ago that gave us three choices .
An online subscription for 59 dollars .
A print subscription for 125 .
Or you could get both for 125 .
Now I looked at this and I called up The Economist .
And I tried to figure out what were they thinking .
And they passed me from one person to another to another , until eventually I got to a person who was in charge of the website .
And I called them up . And they went to check what was going on .
The next thing I know , the ad is gone . And no explanation .
So I decided to do the experiment that I would have loved The Economist to do with me .
I took this and I gave it to 100 MIT students .
I said , &quot; What would you choose ? &quot;
These are the market share . Most people wanted the combo deal .
Thankfully nobody wanted the dominated option .
That means our students can read .
But now if you have an option that nobody wants , you can take it off . Right ?
So I printed another version of this , where I eliminated the middle option .
I gave it to another 100 students . Here is what happens .
Now the most popular option became the least popular .
And the least popular became the most popular .
What was happening was the option that was useless , in the middle , was useless in the sense that nobody wanted it .
But it wasn &apos;t useless in the sense that it helped people figure out what they wanted .
In fact , relative to the option in the middle , which was get only the print for 125 , the print and web for 125 looked like a fantastic deal .
And as a consequence , people chose it .
The general idea here , by the way , is that we actually don &apos;t know our preferences that well .
And because we don &apos;t know our preferences that well we &apos;re susceptible to all of these influences from the external forces : the defaults , the particular options that are presented to us , and so on .
One more example of this .
People believe that when we deal with physical attraction , we see somebody , and we know immediately whether we like them or not , attracted or not .
Which is why we have these four-minute dates .
So I decided to do this experiment with people .
I &apos;ll show you graphic images of people -- not real people .
The experiment was with people .
I showed some people a picture of Tom , and a picture of Jerry .
I said &quot; Who do you want to date ? Tom or Jerry ? &quot;
But for half the people I added an ugly version of Jerry .
I took Photoshop and I made Jerry slightly less attractive .
The other people , I added an ugly version of Tom .
And the question was , will ugly Jerry and ugly Tom help their respective , more attractive brothers ?
The answer was absolutely yes .
When ugly Jerry was around , Jerry was popular .
When ugly Tom was around , Tom was popular .
This of course has two very clear implications for life in general .
If you ever go bar hopping , who do you want to take with you ?
You want a slightly uglier version of yourself .
Similar . Similar ... but slightly uglier .
The second point , or course , is that if somebody else invites you , you know how they think about you .
Now you &apos;re getting it .
What is the general point ?
The general point is that when we think about economics we have this beautiful view of human nature .
&quot; What a piece of work is man ! How noble in reason ! &quot;
We have this view of ourselves , of others .
The behavioral economics perspective is slightly less generous to people .
In fact in medical terms , that &apos;s our view .
But there is a silver lining .
The silver lining is , I think , kind of the reason that behavioral economics is interesting and exciting .
Are we Superman ? Or are we Homer Simpson ?
When it comes to building the physical world , we kind of understand our limitations .
We build steps . And we build these things that not everybody can use obviously .
We understand our limitations , and we build around it .
But for some reason when it comes to the mental world , when we design things like healthcare and retirement and stockmarkets , we somehow forget the idea that we are limited .
I think that if we understood our cognitive limitations in the same way that we understand our physical limitations , even though they don &apos;t stare us in the face in the same way , we could design a better world .
And that , I think , is the hope of this thing .
Thank you very much .

&lt; title &gt; Dan Ariely : Are we in control of our own decisions ? &lt; / title &gt;
&lt; description &gt; Behavioral economist Dan Ariely , the author of Predictably Irrational , uses classic visual illusions and his own counterintuitive research findings to show how we &apos;re not as rational as we think when we make decisions . &lt; / description &gt;

Do you know that we have 1.4 million cellular radio masts deployed worldwide ?
And these are base stations .
And we also have more than five billion of these devices here .
These are cellular mobile phones .
And with these mobile phones , we transmit more than 600 terabytes of data every month .
This is a 6 with 14 zeroes -- a very large number .
And wireless communications has become a utility like electricity and water .
We use it everyday . We use it in our everyday lives now -- in our private lives , in our business lives .
And we even have to be asked sometimes , very kindly , to switch off the mobile phone at events like this for good reasons .
And it &apos;s this importance why I decided to look into the issues that this technology has , because it &apos;s so fundamental to our lives .
And one of the issues is capacity .
The way we transmit wireless data is by using electromagnetic waves -- in particular , radio waves .
And radio waves are limited .
They are scarce ; they are expensive ; and we only have a certain range of it .
And it &apos;s this limitation that doesn &apos;t cope with the demand of wireless data transmissions and the number of bytes and data which are transmitted every month .
And we are simply running out of spectrum .
There &apos;s another problem .
That is efficiency .
These 1.4 million cellular radio masts , or base stations , consume a lot of energy .
And mind you , most of the energy is not used to transmit the radio waves , it is used to cool the base stations .
Then the efficiency of such a base station is only at about five percent .
And that creates a big problem .
Then there &apos;s another issue that you &apos;re all aware of .
You have to switch off your mobile phone during flights .
In hospitals , they are security issues .
And security is another issue .
These radio waves penetrate through walls .
They can be intercepted , and somebody can make use of your network if he has bad intentions .
So these are the main four issues .
But on the other hand , we have 14 billion of these : light bulbs , light .
And light is part of the electromagnetic spectrum .
So let &apos;s look at this in the context of the entire electromagnetic spectrum , where we have gamma rays .
You don &apos;t want to get close to gamma rays , it could be dangerous .
X-rays , useful when you go to hospitals .
Then there &apos;s ultraviolet light .
it &apos;s good for a nice suntan , but otherwise dangerous for the human body .
Infrared -- due to eye safety regulations , can be only used with low power .
And then we have the radio waves , they have the issues I &apos;ve just mentioned .
And in the middle there , we have this visible light spectrum .
It &apos;s light , and light has been around for many millions of years .
And in fact , it has created us , has created life , has created all the stuff of life .
So it &apos;s inherently safe to use .
And wouldn &apos;t it be great to use that for wireless communications ?
Not only that , I compared &#91; it to &#93; the entire spectrum .
I compared the radio waves spectrum -- the size of it -- with the size of the visible light spectrum .
And guess what ?
We have 10,000 times more of that spectrum , which is there for us to use .
So not only do we have this huge amount of spectrum , let &apos;s compare that with a number I &apos;ve just mentioned .
We have 1.4 million expensively deployed , inefficient radio cellular base stations .
And multiply that by 10,000 , then you end up at 14 billion .
14 billion is the number of light bulbs installed already .
So we have the infrastructure there .
Look at the ceiling , you see all these light bulbs .
Go to the main floor , you see these light bulbs .
Can we use them for communications ?
Yes .
What do we need to do ?
The one thing we need to do is we have to replace these inefficient incandescent light bulbs , florescent lights , with this new technology of LED , LED light bulbs .
An LED is a semiconductor . It &apos;s an electronic device .
And it has a very nice acute property .
Its intensity can be modulated at very high speeds , and it can be switched off at very high speeds .
And this is a fundamental basic property that we exploit with our technology .
So let &apos;s show how we do that .
Let &apos;s go to the closest neighbor to the visible light spectrum -- go to remote controls .
You all know remote controls have an infrared LED -- basically you switch on the LED , and if it &apos;s off , you switch it off .
And it creates a simple , low-speed data stream in 10,000 bits per second , 20,000 bits per second .
Not usable for a YouTube video .
What we have done is we have developed a technology with which we can furthermore replace the remote control of our light bulb .
We transmit with our technology , not only a single data stream , we transmit thousands of data streams in parallel , at even higher speeds .
And the technology we have developed -- it &apos;s called SIM OFDM .
And it &apos;s spacial modulation -- these are the only technical terms , I &apos;m not going into details -- but this is how we enabled that light source to transmit data .
You will say , &quot; Okay , this is nice -- a slide created in 10 minutes . &quot;
But not only that .
What we &apos;ve done is we have also developed a demonstrator .
And I &apos;m showing for the first time in public this visible light demonstrator .
And what we have here is no ordinary desk lamp .
We fit in an LED light bulb , worth three U.S. dollars , put in our signal processing technology .
And then what we have here is a little hole .
And the light goes through that hole .
There &apos;s a receiver .
The receiver will convert these little , subtle changes in the amplitude that we create there into an electrical signal .
And that signal is then converted back to a high-speed data stream .
In the future we hope that we can integrate this little hole into these smart phones .
And not only integrate a photo detector here , but maybe use the camera inside .
So what happens when I switch on that light ?
As you would expect , it &apos;s a light , a desk lamp .
Put your book beneath it and you can read .
It &apos;s illuminating the space .
But at the same time , you see this video coming up here .
And that &apos;s a video , a high-definition video that is transmitted through that light beam .
You &apos;re critical .
You think , &quot; Ha , ha , ha .
This is a smart academic doing a little bit of tricks here . &quot;
But let me do this .
Once again .
Still don &apos;t believe ?
It is this light that transmits this high-definition video in a split stream .
And if you look at the light , it is illuminating as you would expect .
You don &apos;t notice with your human eye .
You don &apos;t notice the subtle changes in the amplitude that we impress onto this light bulb .
It &apos;s serving the purpose of illumination , but at the same time , we are able to transmit this data .
And you see , even light from the ceiling comes down here to the receiver .
It can ignore that constant light , because all the receiver &apos;s interested in are subtle changes .
You also have a critical question now , and you say , &quot; Okay , do I have to have the light on all the time to have this working ? &quot;
And the answer is yes .
But , you can dim down the light to a level that it appears to be off .
And you are still able to transmit data -- that &apos;s possible .
So I &apos;ve mentioned to you the four challenges .
Capacity : We have 10,000 times more spectrum , 10,000 times more LEDs installed already in the infrastructure there .
You would agree with me , hopefully , there &apos;s no issue of capacity anymore .
Efficiency : This is data through illumination -- it &apos;s first of all an illumination device .
And if you do the energy budget , the data transmission comes for free -- highly energy efficient .
I don &apos;t mention the high energy efficiency of these LED light bulbs .
If the whole world would deploy them , you would save hundreds of power plants .
That &apos;s aside .
And then I &apos;ve mentioned the availability .
You will agree with me that we have lights in the hospital .
You need to see what to do .
You have lights in an aircraft .
So it &apos;s everywhere in a day there is light .
Look around . Everywhere . Look at your smart phone .
It has a flashlight , an LED flashlight .
These are potential sources for high-speed data transmission .
And then there &apos;s security .
You would agree with me that light doesn &apos;t penetrate through walls .
So no one , if I have a light here , if I have secure data , no one on the other side of this room through that wall would be able to read that data .
And there &apos;s only data where there is light .
So if I don &apos;t want that receiver to receive the data , then what I could do , turn it away .
So the data goes in that direction , not there anymore .
Now we can in fact see where the data is going to .
So for me , the applications of it , to me , are beyond imagination at the moment .
We have had a century of very nice , smart application developers .
And you only have to notice , where we have light , there is a potential way to transmit data .
But I can give you a few examples .
Well you may see the impact already now .
This is a remote operated vehicle beneath the ocean .
And they use light to illuminate space down there .
And this light can be used to transmit wireless data that these things &#91; use &#93; to communicate with each other .
Intrinsically safe environments like this petrochemical plant -- you can &apos;t use RF , it may generate antenna sparks , but you can use light -- you see plenty of light there .
In hospitals , for new medical instruments ; in streets for traffic control .
Cars have LED-based headlights , LED-based back lights , and cars can communicate with each other and prevent accidents in the way that they exchange information .
Traffic lights can communicate to the car and so on .
And then you have these millions of street lamps deployed around the world .
And every street lamp could be a free access point .
We call it , in fact , a Li-Fi , light-fidelity .
And then we have these aircraft cabins .
There are hundreds of lights in an aircraft cabin , and each of these lights could be a potential transmitter of wireless data .
So you could enjoy your most favorite TED video on your long flight back home .
Online life . So that is a vision , I think , that is possible .
So , all we would need to do is to fit a small microchip to every potential illumination device .
And this would then combine two basic functionalities : illumination and wireless data transmission .
And it &apos;s this symbiosis that I personally believe could solve the four essential problems that face us in wireless communication these days .
And in the future , you would not only have 14 billion light bulbs , you may have 14 billion Li-Fis deployed worldwide -- for a cleaner , a greener , and even a brighter future .
Thank you .

&lt; title &gt; Harald Haas : Wireless data from every light bulb &lt; / title &gt;
&lt; description &gt; What if every light bulb in the world could also transmit data ? At TEDGlobal , Harald Haas demonstrates , for the first time , a device that could do exactly that . By flickering the light from a single LED , a change too quick for the human eye to detect , he can transmit far more data than a cellular tower -- and do it in a way that &apos;s more efficient , secure and widespread . &lt; / description &gt;

I grew up to study the brain because I have a brother who has been diagnosed with a brain disorder : schizophrenia . And as a sister and later , as a scientist , I wanted to understand , why is it that I can take my dreams , I can connect them to my reality , and I can make my dreams come true ?
What is it about my brother &apos;s brain and his schizophrenia that he cannot connect his dreams to a common and shared reality , so they instead become delusion ?
So I dedicated my career to research into the severe mental illnesses . And I moved from my home state of Indiana to Boston , where I was working in the lab of Dr. Francine Benes , in the Harvard Department of Psychiatry . And in the lab , we were asking the question , &quot; What are the biological differences between the brains of individuals who would be diagnosed as normal control , as compared with the brains of individuals diagnosed with schizophrenia , schizoaffective or bipolar disorder ? &quot;
So we were essentially mapping the microcircuitry of the brain : which cells are communicating with which cells , with which chemicals , and then in what quantities of those chemicals ?
So there was a lot of meaning in my life because I was performing this type of research during the day .
But then in the evenings and on the weekends , I traveled as an advocate for NAMI , the National Alliance on Mental Illness .
But on the morning of December 10 , 1996 , I woke up to discover that I had a brain disorder of my own .
A blood vessel exploded in the left half of my brain .
And in the course of four hours , I watched my brain completely deteriorate in its ability to process all information . On the morning of the hemorrhage , I could not walk , talk , read , write or recall any of my life .
I essentially became an infant in a woman &apos;s body .
If you &apos;ve ever seen a human brain , it &apos;s obvious that the two hemispheres are completely separate from one another .
And I have brought for you a real human brain .
So this is a real human brain .
This is the front of the brain , the back of brain with the spinal cord hanging down , and this is how it would be positioned inside of my head .
And when you look at the brain , it &apos;s obvious that the two cerebral cortices are completely separate from one another .
For those of you who understand computers , our right hemisphere functions like a parallel processor , while our left hemisphere functions like a serial processor .
The two hemispheres do communicate with one another through the corpus collosum , which is made up of some 300 million axonal fibers .
But other than that , the two hemispheres are completely separate .
Because they process information differently , each of our hemispheres think about different things , they care about different things , and , dare I say , they have very different personalities .
Excuse me . Thank you . It &apos;s been a joy . Assistant : It has been .
Our right human hemisphere is all about this present moment .
It &apos;s all about &quot; right here , right now . &quot;
Our right hemisphere , it thinks in pictures and it learns kinesthetically through the movement of our bodies .
Information , in the form of energy , streams in simultaneously through all of our sensory systems and then it explodes into this enormous collage of what this present moment looks like , what this present moment smells like and tastes like , what it feels like and what it sounds like .
I am an energy-being connected to the energy all around me through the consciousness of my right hemisphere .
We are energy-beings connected to one another through the consciousness of our right hemispheres as one human family .
And right here , right now , we are brothers and sisters on this planet , here to make the world a better place .
And in this moment we are perfect , we are whole and we are beautiful .
My left hemisphere -- our left hemisphere -- is a very different place .
Our left hemisphere thinks linearly and methodically .
Our left hemisphere is all about the past and it &apos;s all about the future .
Our left hemisphere is designed to take that enormous collage of the present moment and start picking out details , details and more details about those details .
It then categorizes and organizes all that information , associates it with everything in the past we &apos;ve ever learned , and projects into the future all of our possibilities .
And our left hemisphere thinks in language .
It &apos;s that ongoing brain chatter that connects me and my internal world to my external world .
It &apos;s that little voice that says to me , &quot; Hey , you gotta remember to pick up bananas on your way home .
I need them in the morning . &quot;
It &apos;s that calculating intelligence that reminds me when I have to do my laundry . But perhaps most important , it &apos;s that little voice that says to me , &quot; I am . I am . &quot; And as soon as my left hemisphere says to me &quot; I am , &quot; I become separate .
I become a single solid individual , separate from the energy flow around me and separate from you .
And this was the portion of my brain that I lost on the morning of my stroke .
On the morning of the stroke , I woke up to a pounding pain behind my left eye . And it was the kind of pain -- caustic pain -- that you get when you bite into ice cream . And it just gripped me -- and then it released me . And then it just gripped me -- and then it released me . And it was very unusual for me to ever experience any kind of pain , so I thought , &quot; OK , I &apos;ll just start my normal routine . &quot;
So I got up and I jumped onto my cardio glider , which is a full-body , full-exercise machine .
And I &apos;m jamming away on this thing , and I &apos;m realizing that my hands look like primitive claws grasping onto the bar . And I thought , &quot; That &apos;s very peculiar . &quot;
And I looked down at my body and I thought , &quot; Whoa , I &apos;m a weird-looking thing . &quot; And it was as though my consciousness had shifted away from my normal perception of reality , where I &apos;m the person on the machine having the experience , to some esoteric space where I &apos;m witnessing myself having this experience .
And it was all very peculiar , and my headache was just getting worse . So I get off the machine , and I &apos;m walking across my living room floor , and I realize that everything inside of my body has slowed way down . And every step is very rigid and very deliberate . There &apos;s no fluidity to my pace , and there &apos;s this constriction in my area of perceptions , so I &apos;m just focused on internal systems .
And I &apos;m standing in my bathroom getting ready to step into the shower , and I could actually hear the dialogue inside of my body . I heard a little voice saying , &quot; OK . You muscles , you gotta contract .
You muscles , you relax . &quot;
And then I lost my balance , and I &apos;m propped up against the wall .
And I look down at my arm and I realize that I can no longer define the boundaries of my body .
I can &apos;t define where I begin and where I end , because the atoms and the molecules of my arm blended with the atoms and molecules of the wall .
And all I could detect was this energy -- energy .
And I &apos;m asking myself , &quot; What is wrong with me ?
What is going on ? &quot; And in that moment , my brain chatter -- my left hemisphere brain chatter -- went totally silent .
Just like someone took a remote control and pushed the mute button . Total silence .
And at first I was shocked to find myself inside of a silent mind . But then I was immediately captivated by the magnificence of the energy around me .
And because I could no longer identify the boundaries of my body , I felt enormous and expansive .
I felt at one with all the energy that was , and it was beautiful there .
Then all of a sudden my left hemisphere comes back online , and it says to me , &quot; Hey ! We got a problem !
We got a problem ! We gotta get some help . &quot;
And I &apos;m going , &quot; Ahh ! I got a problem .
I got a problem . &quot; So it &apos;s like , &quot; OK . OK . I got a problem . &quot;
But then I immediately drifted right back out into the consciousness -- and I affectionately refer to this space as La La Land .
But it was beautiful there . Imagine what it would be like to be totally disconnected from your brain chatter that connects you to the external world .
So here I am in this space , and my job -- and any stress related to my job -- it was gone .
And I felt lighter in my body . And imagine all of the relationships in the external world and any stressors related to any of those -- they were gone .
And I felt this sense of peacefulness .
And imagine what it would feel like to lose 37 years of emotional baggage !
Oh ! I felt euphoria -- euphoria . It was beautiful .
And then , again , my left hemisphere comes online and it says , &quot; Hey ! You &apos;ve got to pay attention .
We &apos;ve got to get help . &quot; And I &apos;m thinking , &quot; I got to get help .
I gotta focus . &quot;
So I get out of the shower and I mechanically dress and I &apos;m walking around my apartment , and I &apos;m thinking , &quot; I gotta get to work . I gotta get to work .
Can I drive ? Can I drive ? &quot;
And in that moment my right arm went totally paralyzed by my side . Then I realized , &quot; Oh my gosh ! I &apos;m having a stroke ! I &apos;m having a stroke ! &quot;
And the next thing my brain says to me is , &quot; Wow !
This is so cool . &quot; &quot; This is so cool !
How many brain scientists have the opportunity to study their own brain from the inside out ? &quot;
And then it crosses my mind , &quot; But I &apos;m a very busy woman ! &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t have time for a stroke ! &quot;
So I &apos;m like , &quot; OK , I can &apos;t stop the stroke from happening , so I &apos;ll do this for a week or two , and then I &apos;ll get back to my routine . OK .
So I gotta call help . I gotta call work . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t remember the number at work , so I remembered , in my office I had a business card with my number on it . So I go into my business room , I pull out a three-inch stack of business cards .
And I &apos;m looking at the card on top and even though I could see clearly in my mind &apos;s eye what my business card looked like , I couldn &apos;t tell if this was my card or not , because all I could see were pixels .
And the pixels of the words blended with the pixels of the background and the pixels of the symbols , and I just couldn &apos;t tell .
And then I would wait for what I call a wave of clarity .
And in that moment , I would be able to reattach to normal reality and I could tell that &apos;s not the card ... that &apos;s not the card ... that &apos;s not the card .
It took me 45 minutes to get one inch down inside of that stack of cards .
In the meantime , for 45 minutes , the hemorrhage is getting bigger in my left hemisphere .
I do not understand numbers , I do not understand the telephone , but it &apos;s the only plan I have .
So I take the phone pad and I put it right here . I take the business card , I put it right here , and I &apos;m matching the shape of the squiggles on the card to the shape of the squiggles on the phone pad .
But then I would drift back out into La La Land , and not remember when I came back if I &apos;d already dialed those numbers .
So I had to wield my paralyzed arm like a stump and cover the numbers as I went along and pushed them , so that as I would come back to normal reality , I &apos;d be able to tell , &quot; Yes , I &apos;ve already dialed that number . &quot;
Eventually , the whole number gets dialed and I &apos;m listening to the phone , and my colleague picks up the phone and he says to me , &quot; Woo woo woo woo . &quot; And I think to myself , &quot; Oh my gosh , he sounds like a Golden Retriever ! &quot;
And so I say to him -- clear in my mind , I say to him : &quot; This is Jill ! I need help ! &quot;
And what comes out of my voice is , &quot; Woo woo woo woo woo . &quot;
I &apos;m thinking , &quot; Oh my gosh , I sound like a Golden Retriever . &quot;
So I couldn &apos;t know -- I didn &apos;t know that I couldn &apos;t speak or understand language until I tried .
So he recognizes that I need help and he gets me help .
And a little while later , I am riding in an ambulance from one hospital across Boston to &#91; Massachusetts &#93; General Hospital .
And I curl up into a little fetal ball .
And just like a balloon with the last bit of air , just , just right out of the balloon , I just felt my energy lift and just -- I felt my spirit surrender .
And in that moment , I knew that I was no longer the choreographer of my life .
And either the doctors rescue my body and give me a second chance at life , or this was perhaps my moment of transition .
When I woke later that afternoon , I was shocked to discover that I was still alive . When I felt my spirit surrender , I said goodbye to my life .
And my mind was now suspended between two very opposite planes of reality . Stimulation coming in through my sensory systems felt like pure pain .
Light burned my brain like wildfire , and sounds were so loud and chaotic that I could not pick a voice out from the background noise , and I just wanted to escape . Because I could not identify the position of my body in space , I felt enormous and expansive , like a genie just liberated from her bottle .
And my spirit soared free , like a great whale gliding through the sea of silent euphoria .
Nirvana . I found Nirvana . And I remember thinking , there &apos;s no way I would ever be able to squeeze the enormousness of myself back inside this tiny little body .
But then I realized , &quot; But I &apos;m still alive ! I &apos;m still alive , and I have found Nirvana . And if I have found Nirvana and I &apos;m still alive , then everyone who is alive can find Nirvana . &quot; And I pictured a world filled with beautiful , peaceful , compassionate , loving people who knew that they could come to this space at any time . And that they could purposely choose to step to the right of their left hemispheres and find this peace . And then I realized what a tremendous gift this experience could be , what a stroke of insight this could be to how we live our lives . And it motivated me to recover .
Two and a half weeks after the hemorrhage , the surgeons went in and they removed a blood clot the size of a golf ball that was pushing on my language centers .
Here I am with my mama , who is a true angel in my life . It took me eight years to completely recover .
So who are we ? We are the life-force power of the universe , with manual dexterity and two cognitive minds .
And we have the power to choose , moment by moment , who and how we want to be in the world .
Right here , right now , I can step into the consciousness of my right hemisphere , where we are .
I am the life-force power of the universe .
I am the life-force power of the 50 trillion beautiful molecular geniuses that make up my form , at one with all that is .
Or , I can choose to step into the consciousness of my left hemisphere , where I become a single individual , a solid . Separate from the flow , separate from you . I am Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor : intellectual , neuroanatomist . These are the &quot; we &quot; inside of me .
Which would you choose ? Which do you choose ? And when ?
I believe that the more time we spend choosing to run the deep inner-peace circuitry of our right hemispheres , the more peace we will project into the world , and the more peaceful our planet will be .
And I thought that was an idea worth spreading .

William , hi . Good to see you .
William Kamkwamba : Thanks .
So , we &apos;ve got a picture , I think ? Where is this ?
WK : This is my home . This is where I live .
Where ? What country ?
WK : In Malawi , Kasungu . In Kasungu . Yeah , Mala .
OK . Now , you &apos;re 19 now ?
WK : Yeah . I &apos;m 19 years now .
Five years ago you had an idea . What was that ?
WK : I wanted to make a windmill .
A windmill ?
WK : Yeah .
What , to power -- for lighting and stuff ?
WK : Yeah .
So what did you do ? How did you realize that ?
WK : After I dropped out of school , I went to library , and I read a book that would -- &quot; Using Energy , &quot; and I get information about doing the mill .
And I tried , and I made it .
So you copied -- you exactly copied the design in the book .
WK : Ah , no . I just -- What happened ?
WK : In fact , a design of the windmill that was in the book , it has got four -- ah -- three blades , and mine has got four blades .
The book had three , yours had four .
WK : Yeah .
And you made it out of what ?
WK : I made four blades , just because I want to increase power .
OK .
WK : Yeah .
You tested three , and found that four worked better ?
WK : Yeah . I test .
And what did you make the windmill out of ?
What materials did you use ?
WK : I use a bicycle frame , and a pulley , and plastic pipe , what then pulls -- Do we have a picture of that ? Can we have the next slide ?
WK : Yeah . The windmill .
And so , and that windmill , what -- it worked ?
WK : When the wind blows , it rotates and generates .
How much electricity ?
WK : 12 watts .
And so , that lit a light for the house ? How many lights ?
WK : Four bulbs and two radios .
Wow .
WK : Yeah .
Next slide -- so who &apos;s that ?
WK : This is my parents , holding the radio .
So what did they make of -- that you were 14 , 15 at the time -- what did they make of this ? They were impressed ?
WK : Yeah .
And so what &apos;s your -- what are you going to do with this ?
WK : Um -- What do you -- I mean -- do you want to build another one ?
WK : Yeah , I want to build another one -- to pump water and irrigation for crops .
So this one would have to be bigger ?
WK : Yeah .
How big ?
WK : I think it will produce more than 20 the watts .
So that would produce irrigation for the entire village ?
WK : Yeah .
Wow . And so you &apos;re talking to people here at TED to get people who might be able to help in some way to realize this dream ?
WK : Yeah , if they can help me with materials , yeah .
And as you think of your life going forward , you &apos;re 19 now , do you picture continuing with this dream of working in energy ?
WK : Yeah . I &apos;m still thinking to work on energy .
Wow . William , it &apos;s a real honor to have you at the TED conference .
Thank you so much for coming .
WK : Thank you .

&lt; title &gt; William Kamkwamba : How I built a windmill &lt; / title &gt;
&lt; description &gt; When he was just 14 years old , Malawian inventor William Kamkwamba built his family an electricity-generating windmill from spare parts , working from rough plans he found in a library book . &lt; / description &gt;

In 1975 , I met in Florence a professor , Carlo Pedretti , my former professor of art history , and today a world-renowned scholar of Leonardo da Vinci .
Well , he asked me if I could find some technological way to unfold a five-centuries-old mystery related to a lost masterpiece by Leonardo da Vinci , the &quot; Battle of Anghiari , &quot; which is supposed to be located in the Hall of the 500 in Palazzo Vecchio , in Florence .
Well , in the mid- &apos; 70s , there were not great opportunities for a bioengineer like me , especially in Italy , and so I decided , with some researchers from the United States and the University of Florence , to start probing the murals decorated by Vasari on the long walls of the Hall of the 500 searching for the lost Leonardo .
Unfortunately , at that time we did not know that that was not exactly where we should be looking , because we had to go much deeper in , and so the research came to a halt , and it was only taken up in 2000 thanks to the interest and the enthusiasm of the Guinness family .
Well , this time , we focused on trying to reconstruct the way the Hall of the 500 was before the remodeling , and the so-called Sala Grande , which was built in 1494 , and to find out the original doors , windows , and in order to do that , we first created a 3D model , and then , with thermography , we went on to discover hidden windows . These are the original windows of the hall of the Sala Grande . We also found out about the height of the ceiling , and we managed to reconstruct , therefore , all the layout of this original hall the way it was before there came Vasari , and restructured the whole thing , including a staircase that was very important in order to precisely place &quot; The Battle of Anghiari &quot; on a specific area of one of the two walls .
Well , we also learned that Vasari , who was commissioned to remodel the Hall of the 500 between 1560 and 1574 by the Grand Duke Cosimo I of the Medici family , we have at least two instances when he saved masterpieces specifically by placing a brick wall in front of it and leaving a small air gap .
One that we &#91; see &#93; here , Masaccio , the church of Santa Maria Novella in Florence , so we just said , well maybe , Visari has done something like that in the case of this great work of art by Leonardo , since he was a great admirer of Leonardo da Vinci .
And so we built some very sophisticated radio antennas just for probing both walls and searching for an air gap .
And we did find many on the right panel of the east wall , an air gap , and that &apos;s where we believe &quot; The Battle of Anghiari , &quot; or at least the part that we know has been painted , which is called &quot; The Fight for the Standard , &quot; should be located .
Well , from there , unfortunately , in 2004 , the project came to a halt . Many political reasons .
So I decided to go back to my alma mater , and , at the University of California , San Diego , and I proposed to open up a research center for engineering sciences for cultural heritage .
And in 2007 , we created CISA3 as a research center for cultural heritage , specifically art , architecture and archaeology . So students started to flow in , and we started to build technologies , because that &apos;s basically what we also needed in order to move forward and go and do fieldwork .
We came back in the Hall of the 500 in 2011 , and this time , with a great group of students , and my colleague , Professor Falko Kuester , who is now the director at CISA3 , and we came back just since we knew already where to look for to find out if there was still something left .
Well , we were confined though , limited , I should rather say , for several reasons that it &apos;s not worth explaining , to endoscopy only , of the many other options we had , and with a 4mm camera attached to it , we were successful in documenting and taking some fragments of what it turns out to be beige fragments that later on we ran a much more sophisticated exams , XRF , X-ray diffraction , and the results are very positive so far . It seems to indicate that indeed we have found some pigments , and since we know for sure that no other artist has painted on that wall before Vasari came in about 60 years later , well , those pigments are therefore firmly related to mural painting and most likely to Leonardo .
Well , we are searching for the highest and highly praised work of art ever achieved by mankind .
As a matter of fact , this is by far the most important commission that Leonardo has ever had , and for doing this great masterpiece , he was named the number one artist influence at the time .
I had also had the privilege since the last 37 years to work on several masterpieces as you can see behind me , but basically to do what ? Well , to assess , for example , the state of conservation . See here the face of the Madonna of the Chair that when just shining a UV light on it you suddenly see another , different lady , aged lady , I should rather say .
There is a lot of varnish still sitting there , several retouches , and some over cleaning . It becomes very visible .
But also , technology has helped to write new pages of our history , or at least to update pages of our histories .
For example , the &quot; Lady with the Unicorn , &quot; another painting by Rafael , well , you see the unicorn .
A lot has been said and written about the unicorn , but if you take an X-ray of the unicorn , it becomes a puppy dog .
And — — no problem , but , unfortunately , continuing with the scientific examination of this painting came out that Rafael did not paint the unicorn , did not paint the puppy dog , actually left the painting unfinished , so all this writing about the exotic symbol of the unicorn — — unfortunately , is not very reliable .
Well , also , authenticity . Just think for a moment if science really could move in the field of authenticity of works of art . There would be a cultural revolution to say the least , but also , I would say , a market revolution , let me add . Take this example : Otto Marseus , nice painting , which is &quot; Still Life &quot; at the Pitti Gallery , and just have an infrared camera peering through , and luckily for art historians , it just was confirmed that there is a signature of Otto Marseus . It even says when it was made and also the location .
So that was a good result . Sometimes , it &apos;s not that good , and so , again , authenticity and science could go together and change the way , not attributions being made , but at least lay the ground for a more objective , or , I should rather say , less subjective attribution , as it is done today .
But I would say the discovery that really caught my imagination , my admiration , is the incredibly vivid drawing under this layer , brown layer , of &quot; The Adoration of the Magi . &quot; Here you see a handmade setting XYZ scanner with an infrared camera put on it , and just peering through this brown layer of this masterpiece to reveal what could have been underneath .
Well , this happens to be the most important painting we have in Italy by Leonardo da Vinci , and look at the wonderful images of faces that nobody has seen for five centuries . Look at these portraits .
They &apos;re magnificent . You see Leonardo at work .
You see the geniality of his creation , right directly on the ground layer of the panel , and see this cool thing , finding , I should rather say , an elephant . Because of this elephant , over 70 new images came out , never seen for centuries .
This was an epiphany . We came to understand and to prove that the brown coating that we see today was not done by Leonardo da Vinci , which left us only the other drawing that for five centuries we were not able to see , so thanks only to technology .
Well , the tablet . Well , we thought , well , if we all have this pleasure , this privilege to see all this , to find all these discoveries , what about for everybody else ?
So we thought of an augmented reality application using a tablet . Let me show you just simulating what we could be doing , any of us could be doing , in a museum environment .
So let &apos;s say that we go to a museum with a tablet , okay ?
And we just aim the camera of the tablet to the painting that we are interested to see , like this .
Okay ? And I will just click on it , we pause , and now let me turn to you so the moment the image , or , I should say , the camera , has locked in the painting , then the images you just saw up there in the drawing are being loaded . And so , see .
We can , as we said , we can zoom in . Then we can scroll .
Okay ? Let &apos;s go and find the elephant .
So all we need is one finger . Just wipe off and we see the elephant .
Okay ? And then if we want , we can continue the scroll to find out , for example , on the staircase , the whole iconography is going to be changed . There are a lot of laymen reconstructing from the ruins of an old temple a new temple , and there are a lot of figures showing up . See ?
This is not just a curiosity , because it changes not just the iconography as you see it , but the iconology , the meaning of the painting , and we believe this is a cool way , easy way , that everybody could have access to , to become more the protagonist of your own discovery , and not just be so passive about it , as we are when we walk through endless rooms of museums .
Another concept is the digital clinical chart , which sounds very obvious if we were to talk about real patients , but when we talk about works of art , unfortunately , it &apos;s never been tapped as an idea .
Well , we believe , again , that this should be the beginning , the very first step , to do real conservation , and allowing us to really explore and to understand everything related to the state of our conservation , the technique , materials , and also if , when , and why we should restore , or , rather , to intervene on the environment surrounding the painting .
Well , our vision is to rediscover the spirit of the Renaissance , create a new discipline where engineering for cultural heritage is actually a symbol of blending art and science together .
We definitely need a new breed of engineers that will go out and do this kind of work and rediscover for us these values , these cultural values that we badly need , especially today .
And if you want to summarize in one just single word , well , this is what we &apos;re trying to do .
We &apos;re trying to give a future to our past in order to have a future .
As long as we live a life of curiosity and passion , there is a bit of Leonardo in all of us . Thank you .

&lt; title &gt; Maurizio Seracini : The secret lives of paintings &lt; / title &gt;
&lt; description &gt; Art history is far from set in stone . Engineer Maurizio Seracini spent 30 years searching for Leonardo da Vinci &apos;s lost fresco &quot; The Battle of Anghiari , &quot; and in the process discovered that many paintings have layers of history hidden underneath . Should they be part of the viewing experience too ? &lt; / description &gt;

So I want to start by offering you a free no-tech life hack , and all it requires of you is this : that you change your posture for two minutes .
But before I give it away , I want to ask you to right now do a little audit of your body and what you &apos;re doing with your body .
So how many of you are sort of making yourselves smaller ?
Maybe you &apos;re hunching , crossing your legs , maybe wrapping your ankles .
Sometimes we hold onto our arms like this .
Sometimes we spread out .
I see you .
So I want you to pay attention to what you &apos;re doing right now .
We &apos;re going to come back to that in a few minutes , and I &apos;m hoping that if you learn to tweak this a little bit , it could significantly change the way your life unfolds .
So , we &apos;re really fascinated with body language , and we &apos;re particularly interested in other people &apos;s body language .
You know , we &apos;re interested in , like , you know — — an awkward interaction , or a smile , or a contemptuous glance , or maybe a very awkward wink , or maybe even something like a handshake .
Here they are arriving at Number 10 , and look at this lucky policeman gets to shake hands with the President of the United States . Oh , and here comes Amy Cuddy : So a handshake , or the lack of a handshake , can have us talking for weeks and weeks and weeks .
Even the BBC and The New York Times .
So obviously when we think about nonverbal behavior , or body language -- but we call it nonverbals as social scientists -- it &apos;s language , so we think about communication .
When we think about communication , we think about interactions .
So what is your body language communicating to me ?
What &apos;s mine communicating to you ?
And there &apos;s a lot of reason to believe that this is a valid way to look at this . So social scientists have spent a lot of time looking at the effects of our body language , or other people &apos;s body language , on judgments .
And we make sweeping judgments and inferences from body language .
And those judgments can predict really meaningful life outcomes like who we hire or promote , who we ask out on a date .
For example , Nalini Ambady , a researcher at Tufts University , shows that when people watch 30-second soundless clips of real physician-patient interactions , their judgments of the physician &apos;s niceness predict whether or not that physician will be sued .
So it doesn &apos;t have to do so much with whether or not that physician was incompetent , but do we like that person and how they interacted ?
Even more dramatic , Alex Todorov at Princeton has shown us that judgments of political candidates &apos; faces in just one second predict 70 percent of U.S. Senate and gubernatorial race outcomes , and even , let &apos;s go digital , emoticons used well in online negotiations can lead to you claim more value from that negotiation .
If you use them poorly , bad idea . Right ?
So when we think of nonverbals , we think of how we judge others , how they judge us and what the outcomes are .
We tend to forget , though , the other audience that &apos;s influenced by our nonverbals , and that &apos;s ourselves .
We are also influenced by our nonverbals , our thoughts and our feelings and our physiology .
So what nonverbals am I talking about ?
I &apos;m a social psychologist . I study prejudice , and I teach at a competitive business school , so it was inevitable that I would become interested in power dynamics .
I became especially interested in nonverbal expressions of power and dominance .
And what are nonverbal expressions of power and dominance ?
Well , this is what they are .
So in the animal kingdom , they are about expanding .
So you make yourself big , you stretch out , you take up space , you &apos;re basically opening up .
It &apos;s about opening up . And this is true across the animal kingdom . It &apos;s not just limited to primates .
And humans do the same thing .
So they do this both when they have power sort of chronically , and also when they &apos;re feeling powerful in the moment .
And this one is especially interesting because it really shows us how universal and old these expressions of power are .
This expression , which is known as pride , Jessica Tracy has studied . She shows that people who are born with sight and people who are congenitally blind do this when they win at a physical competition .
So when they cross the finish line and they &apos;ve won , it doesn &apos;t matter if they &apos;ve never seen anyone do it .
They do this .
So the arms up in the V , the chin is slightly lifted .
What do we do when we feel powerless ? We do exactly the opposite . We close up . We wrap ourselves up .
We make ourselves small . We don &apos;t want to bump into the person next to us .
So again , both animals and humans do the same thing .
And this is what happens when you put together high and low power . So what we tend to do when it comes to power is that we complement the other &apos;s nonverbals .
So if someone is being really powerful with us , we tend to make ourselves smaller . We don &apos;t mirror them .
We do the opposite of them .
So I &apos;m watching this behavior in the classroom , and what do I notice ? I notice that MBA students really exhibit the full range of power nonverbals .
So you have people who are like caricatures of alphas , really coming into the room , they get right into the middle of the room before class even starts , like they really want to occupy space .
When they sit down , they &apos;re sort of spread out .
They raise their hands like this .
You have other people who are virtually collapsing when they come in . As soon they come in , you see it .
You see it on their faces and their bodies , and they sit in their chair and they make themselves tiny , and they go like this when they raise their hand .
I notice a couple of things about this .
One , you &apos;re not going to be surprised .
It seems to be related to gender .
So women are much more likely to do this kind of thing than men .
Women feel chronically less powerful than men , so this is not surprising . But the other thing I noticed is that it also seemed to be related to the extent to which the students were participating , and how well they were participating .
And this is really important in the MBA classroom , because participation counts for half the grade .
So business schools have been struggling with this gender grade gap .
You get these equally qualified women and men coming in and then you get these differences in grades , and it seems to be partly attributable to participation .
So I started to wonder , you know , okay , so you have these people coming in like this , and they &apos;re participating . Is it possible that we could get people to fake it and would it lead them to participate more ?
So my main collaborator Dana Carney , who &apos;s at Berkeley , and I really wanted to know , can you fake it till you make it ?
Like , can you do this just for a little while and actually experience a behavioral outcome that makes you seem more powerful ?
So we know that our nonverbals govern how other people think and feel about us . There &apos;s a lot of evidence .
But our question really was , do our nonverbals govern how we think and feel about ourselves ?
There &apos;s some evidence that they do .
So , for example , we smile when we feel happy , but also , when we &apos;re forced to smile by holding a pen in our teeth like this , it makes us feel happy .
So it goes both ways . When it comes to power , it also goes both ways . So when you feel powerful , you &apos;re more likely to do this , but it &apos;s also possible that when you pretend to be powerful , you are more likely to actually feel powerful .
So the second question really was , you know , so we know that our minds change our bodies , but is it also true that our bodies change our minds ?
And when I say minds , in the case of the powerful , what am I talking about ?
So I &apos;m talking about thoughts and feelings and the sort of physiological things that make up our thoughts and feelings , and in my case , that &apos;s hormones . I look at hormones .
So what do the minds of the powerful versus the powerless look like ?
So powerful people tend to be , not surprisingly , more assertive and more confident , more optimistic .
They actually feel that they &apos;re going to win even at games of chance .
They also tend to be able to think more abstractly .
So there are a lot of differences . They take more risks .
There are a lot of differences between powerful and powerless people .
Physiologically , there also are differences on two key hormones : testosterone , which is the dominance hormone , and cortisol , which is the stress hormone .
So what we find is that high-power alpha males in primate hierarchies have high testosterone and low cortisol , and powerful and effective leaders also have high testosterone and low cortisol .
So what does that mean ? When you think about power , people tended to think only about testosterone , because that was about dominance .
But really , power is also about how you react to stress .
So do you want the high-power leader that &apos;s dominant , high on testosterone , but really stress reactive ?
Probably not , right ? You want the person who &apos;s powerful and assertive and dominant , but not very stress reactive , the person who &apos;s laid back .
So we know that in primate hierarchies , if an alpha needs to take over , if an individual needs to take over an alpha role sort of suddenly , within a few days , that individual &apos;s testosterone has gone up significantly and his cortisol has dropped significantly .
So we have this evidence , both that the body can shape the mind , at least at the facial level , and also that role changes can shape the mind .
So what happens , okay , you take a role change , what happens if you do that at a really minimal level , like this tiny manipulation , this tiny intervention ?
&quot; For two minutes , &quot; you say , &quot; I want you to stand like this , and it &apos;s going to make you feel more powerful . &quot;
So this is what we did . We decided to bring people into the lab and run a little experiment , and these people adopted , for two minutes , either high-power poses or low-power poses , and I &apos;m just going to show you five of the poses , although they took on only two .
So here &apos;s one .
A couple more .
This one has been dubbed the &quot; Wonder Woman &quot; by the media .
Here are a couple more .
So you can be standing or you can be sitting .
And here are the low-power poses .
So you &apos;re folding up , you &apos;re making yourself small .
This one is very low-power .
When you &apos;re touching your neck , you &apos;re really protecting yourself .
So this is what happens . They come in , they spit into a vial , we for two minutes say , &quot; You need to do this or this . &quot;
They don &apos;t look at pictures of the poses . We don &apos;t want to prime them with a concept of power . We want them to be feeling power , right ? So two minutes they do this .
We then ask them , &quot; How powerful do you feel ? &quot; on a series of items , and then we give them an opportunity to gamble , and then we take another saliva sample .
That &apos;s it . That &apos;s the whole experiment .
So this is what we find . Risk tolerance , which is the gambling , what we find is that when you &apos;re in the high-power pose condition , 86 percent of you will gamble .
When you &apos;re in the low-power pose condition , only 60 percent , and that &apos;s a pretty whopping significant difference .
Here &apos;s what we find on testosterone .
From their baseline when they come in , high-power people experience about a 20-percent increase , and low-power people experience about a 10-percent decrease .
So again , two minutes , and you get these changes .
Here &apos;s what you get on cortisol . High-power people experience about a 25-percent decrease , and the low-power people experience about a 15-percent increase .
So two minutes lead to these hormonal changes that configure your brain to basically be either assertive , confident and comfortable , or really stress-reactive , and , you know , feeling sort of shut down . And we &apos;ve all had the feeling , right ?
So it seems that our nonverbals do govern how we think and feel about ourselves , so it &apos;s not just others , but it &apos;s also ourselves .
Also , our bodies change our minds .
But the next question , of course , is can power posing for a few minutes really change your life in meaningful ways ?
So this is in the lab . It &apos;s this little task , you know , it &apos;s just a couple of minutes . Where can you actually apply this ? Which we cared about , of course .
And so we think it &apos;s really , what matters , I mean , where you want to use this is evaluative situations like social threat situations . Where are you being evaluated , either by your friends ? Like for teenagers it &apos;s at the lunchroom table .
It could be , you know , for some people it &apos;s speaking at a school board meeting . It might be giving a pitch or giving a talk like this or doing a job interview .
We decided that the one that most people could relate to because most people had been through was the job interview .
So we published these findings , and the media are all over it , and they say , Okay , so this is what you do when you go in for the job interview , right ?
You know , so we were of course horrified , and said , Oh my God , no , no , no , that &apos;s not what we meant at all .
For numerous reasons , no , no , no , don &apos;t do that .
Again , this is not about you talking to other people .
It &apos;s you talking to yourself . What do you do before you go into a job interview ? You do this .
Right ? You &apos;re sitting down . You &apos;re looking at your iPhone -- or your Android , not trying to leave anyone out .
You are , you know , you &apos;re looking at your notes , you &apos;re hunching up , making yourself small , when really what you should be doing maybe is this , like , in the bathroom , right ? Do that . Find two minutes .
So that &apos;s what we want to test . Okay ?
So we bring people into a lab , and they do either high- or low-power poses again , they go through a very stressful job interview .
It &apos;s five minutes long . They are being recorded .
They &apos;re being judged also , and the judges are trained to give no nonverbal feedback , so they look like this . Like , imagine this is the person interviewing you .
So for five minutes , nothing , and this is worse than being heckled .
People hate this . It &apos;s what Marianne LaFrance calls &quot; standing in social quicksand . &quot;
So this really spikes your cortisol .
So this is the job interview we put them through , because we really wanted to see what happened .
We then have these coders look at these tapes , four of them .
They &apos;re blind to the hypothesis . They &apos;re blind to the conditions .
They have no idea who &apos;s been posing in what pose , and they end up looking at these sets of tapes , and they say , &quot; Oh , we want to hire these people , &quot; -- all the high-power posers -- &quot; we don &apos;t want to hire these people .
We also evaluate these people much more positively overall . &quot;
But what &apos;s driving it ? It &apos;s not about the content of the speech .
It &apos;s about the presence that they &apos;re bringing to the speech .
We also , because we rate them on all these variables related to competence , like , how well-structured is the speech ? How good is it ? What are their qualifications ?
No effect on those things . This is what &apos;s affected .
These kinds of things . People are bringing their true selves , basically . They &apos;re bringing themselves .
They bring their ideas , but as themselves , with no , you know , residue over them .
So this is what &apos;s driving the effect , or mediating the effect .
So when I tell people about this , that our bodies change our minds and our minds can change our behavior , and our behavior can change our outcomes , they say to me , &quot; I don &apos;t -- It feels fake . &quot; Right ?
So I said , fake it till you make it . I don &apos;t -- It &apos;s not me .
I don &apos;t want to get there and then still feel like a fraud .
I don &apos;t want to feel like an impostor .
I don &apos;t want to get there only to feel like I &apos;m not supposed to be here .
And that really resonated with me , because I want to tell you a little story about being an impostor and feeling like I &apos;m not supposed to be here .
When I was 19 , I was in a really bad car accident .
I was thrown out of a car , rolled several times .
I was thrown from the car . And I woke up in a head injury rehab ward , and I had been withdrawn from college , and I learned that my I.Q. had dropped by two standard deviations , which was very traumatic .
I knew my I.Q. because I had identified with being smart , and I had been called gifted as a child .
So I &apos;m taken out of college , I keep trying to go back .
They say , &quot; You &apos;re not going to finish college .
Just , you know , there are other things for you to do , but that &apos;s not going to work out for you . &quot;
So I really struggled with this , and I have to say , having your identity taken from you , your core identity , and for me it was being smart , having that taken from you , there &apos;s nothing that leaves you feeling more powerless than that .
So I felt entirely powerless . I worked and worked and worked , and I got lucky , and worked , and got lucky , and worked .
Eventually I graduated from college .
It took me four years longer than my peers , and I convinced someone , my angel advisor , Susan Fiske , to take me on , and so I ended up at Princeton , and I was like , I am not supposed to be here .
I am an impostor .
And the night before my first-year talk , and the first-year talk at Princeton is a 20-minute talk to 20 people . That &apos;s it .
I was so afraid of being found out the next day that I called her and said , &quot; I &apos;m quitting . &quot;
She was like , &quot; You are not quitting , because I took a gamble on you , and you &apos;re staying .
You &apos;re going to stay , and this is what you &apos;re going to do .
You are going to fake it .
You &apos;re going to do every talk that you ever get asked to do .
You &apos;re just going to do it and do it and do it , even if you &apos;re terrified and just paralyzed and having an out-of-body experience , until you have this moment where you say , &apos; Oh my gosh , I &apos;m doing it .
Like , I have become this . I am actually doing this . &apos; &quot; So that &apos;s what I did . Five years in grad school , a few years , you know , I &apos;m at Northwestern , I moved to Harvard , I &apos;m at Harvard , I &apos;m not really thinking about it anymore , but for a long time I had been thinking , &quot; Not supposed to be here . Not supposed to be here . &quot;
So at the end of my first year at Harvard , a student who had not talked in class the entire semester , who I had said , &quot; Look , you &apos;ve gotta participate or else you &apos;re going to fail , &quot; came into my office . I really didn &apos;t know her at all .
And she said , she came in totally defeated , and she said , &quot; I &apos;m not supposed to be here . &quot;
And that was the moment for me . Because two things happened .
One was that I realized , oh my gosh , I don &apos;t feel like that anymore . You know .
I don &apos;t feel that anymore , but she does , and I get that feeling .
And the second was , she is supposed to be here !
Like , she can fake it , she can become it .
So I was like , &quot; Yes , you are ! You are supposed to be here !
And tomorrow you &apos;re going to fake it , you &apos;re going to make yourself powerful , and , you know , you &apos;re gonna — &quot; &quot; And you &apos;re going to go into the classroom , and you are going to give the best comment ever . &quot;
You know ? And she gave the best comment ever , and people turned around and they were like , oh my God , I didn &apos;t even notice her sitting there , you know ?
She comes back to me months later , and I realized that she had not just faked it till she made it , she had actually faked it till she became it .
So she had changed .
And so I want to say to you , don &apos;t fake it till you make it .
Fake it till you become it . You know ? It &apos;s not — Do it enough until you actually become it and internalize .
The last thing I &apos;m going to leave you with is this .
Tiny tweaks can lead to big changes .
So this is two minutes .
Two minutes , two minutes , two minutes .
Before you go into the next stressful evaluative situation , for two minutes , try doing this , in the elevator , in a bathroom stall , at your desk behind closed doors .
That &apos;s what you want to do . Configure your brain to cope the best in that situation .
Get your testosterone up . Get your cortisol down .
Don &apos;t leave that situation feeling like , oh , I didn &apos;t show them who I am .
Leave that situation feeling like , oh , I really feel like I got to say who I am and show who I am .
So I want to ask you first , you know , both to try power posing , and also I want to ask you to share the science , because this is simple .
I don &apos;t have ego involved in this .
Give it away . Share it with people , because the people who can use it the most are the ones with no resources and no technology and no status and no power . Give it to them because they can do it in private .
They need their bodies , privacy and two minutes , and it can significantly change the outcomes of their life .
Thank you .

&lt; title &gt; Amy Cuddy : Your body language shapes who you are &lt; / title &gt;
&lt; description &gt; Body language affects how others see us , but it may also change how we see ourselves . Social psychologist Amy Cuddy shows how &quot; power posing &quot; -- standing in a posture of confidence , even when we don &apos;t feel confident -- can affect testosterone and cortisol levels in the brain , and might even have an impact on our chances for success . &lt; / description &gt;

How many Creationists do we have in the room ?
Probably none . I think we &apos;re all Darwinians .
And yet many Darwinians are anxious , a little uneasy -- would like to see some limits on just how far the Darwinism goes .
It &apos;s all right .
You know spiderwebs ? Sure , they are products of evolution .
The World Wide Web ? Not so sure .
Beaver dams , yes . Hoover Dam , no .
What do they think it is that prevents the products of human ingenuity from being themselves , fruits of the tree of life , and hence , in some sense , obeying evolutionary rules ?
And yet people are interestingly resistant to the idea of applying evolutionary thinking to thinking -- to our thinking .
And so I &apos;m going to talk a little bit about that , keeping in mind that we have a lot on the program here .
So you &apos;re out in the woods , or you &apos;re out in the pasture , and you see this ant crawling up this blade of grass .
It climbs up to the top , and it falls , and it climbs , and it falls , and it climbs -- trying to stay at the very top of the blade of grass .
What is this ant doing ? What is this in aid of ?
What goals is this ant trying to achieve by climbing this blade of grass ?
What &apos;s in it for the ant ?
And the answer is : nothing . There &apos;s nothing in it for the ant .
Well then , why is it doing this ?
Is it just a fluke ?
Yeah , it &apos;s just a fluke . It &apos;s a lancet fluke .
It &apos;s a little brain worm .
It &apos;s a parasitic brain worm that has to get into the stomach of a sheep or a cow in order to continue its life cycle .
Salmon swim upstream to get to their spawning grounds , and lancet flukes commandeer a passing ant , crawl into its brain , and drive it up a blade of grass like an all-terrain vehicle .
So there &apos;s nothing in it for the ant .
The ant &apos;s brain has been hijacked by a parasite that infects the brain , inducing suicidal behavior .
Pretty scary .
Well , does anything like that happen with human beings ?
This is all on behalf of a cause other than one &apos;s own genetic fitness , of course .
Well , it may already have occurred to you that Islam means &quot; surrender , &quot; or &quot; submission of self-interest to the will of Allah . &quot;
Well , it &apos;s ideas -- not worms -- that hijack our brains .
Now , am I saying that a sizable minority of the world &apos;s population has had their brain hijacked by parasitic ideas ?
No , it &apos;s worse than that .
Most people have .
There are a lot of ideas to die for .
Freedom , if you &apos;re from New Hampshire .
Justice . Truth . Communism .
Many people have laid down their lives for communism , and many have laid down their lives for capitalism .
And many for Catholicism . And many for Islam .
These are just a few of the ideas that are to die for .
They &apos;re infectious .
Yesterday , Amory Lovins spoke about &quot; infectious repititis . &quot;
It was a term of abuse , in effect .
This is unthinking engineering .
Well , most of the cultural spread that goes on is not brilliant , new , out-of-the-box thinking .
It &apos;s &quot; infectious repetitis , &quot; and we might as well try to have a theory of what &apos;s going on when that happens so that we can understand the conditions of infection .
Hosts work hard to spread these ideas to others .
I myself am a philosopher , and one of our occupational hazards is that people ask us what the meaning of life is .
And you have to have a bumper sticker , you know . You have to have a statement .
So , this is mine .
The secret of happiness is : Find something more important than you are and dedicate your life to it .
Most of us -- now that the &quot; Me Decade &quot; is well in the past -- now we actually do this .
One set of ideas or another have simply replaced our biological imperatives in our own lives .
This is what our summum bonum is .
It &apos;s not maximizing the number of grandchildren we have .
Now , this is a profound biological effect .
It &apos;s the subordination of genetic interest to other interests .
And no other species does anything at all like it .
Well , how are we going to think about this ?
It is , on the one hand , a biological effect , and a very large one .
Unmistakable .
Now , what theories do we want to use to look at this ?
Well , many theories . But how could something tie them together ?
The idea of replicating ideas ; ideas that replicate by passing from brain to brain .
Richard Dawkins , whom you &apos;ll be hearing later in the day , invented the term &quot; memes , &quot; and put forward the first really clear and vivid version of this idea in his book &quot; The Selfish Gene . &quot;
Now here am I talking about his idea .
Well , you see , it &apos;s not his . Yes -- he started it .
But it &apos;s everybody &apos;s idea now .
And he &apos;s not responsible for what I say about memes .
I &apos;m responsible for what I say about memes .
Actually , I think we &apos;re all responsible for not just the intended effects of our ideas , but for their likely misuses .
So it is important , I think , to Richard , and to me , that these ideas not be abused and misused .
They &apos;re very easy to misuse . That &apos;s why they &apos;re dangerous .
And it &apos;s just about a full-time job trying to prevent people who are scared of these ideas from caricaturing them and then running off to one dire purpose or another .
So we have to keep plugging away , trying to correct the misapprehensions so that only the benign and useful variants of our ideas continue to spread .
But it is a problem .
We don &apos;t have much time , and I &apos;m going to go over just a little bit of this and cut out , because there &apos;s a lot of other things that are going to be said .
So let me just point out : memes are like viruses .
That &apos;s what Richard said , back in &apos; 93 .
And you might think , &quot; Well , how can that be ?
I mean , a virus is -- you know , it &apos;s stuff ! What &apos;s a meme made of ? &quot;
Yesterday , Negroponte was talking about viral telecommunications but -- what &apos;s a virus ?
A virus is a string of nucleic acid with attitude .
That is , there is something about it that tends to make it replicate better than the competition does .
And that &apos;s what a meme is . It &apos;s an information packet with attitude .
What &apos;s a meme made of ? What are bits made of , Mom ?
Not silicon .
They &apos;re made of information , and can be carried in any physical medium .
What &apos;s a word made of ?
Sometimes when people say , &quot; Do memes exist ? &quot;
I say , &quot; Well , do words exist ? Are they in your ontology ? &quot;
If they are , words are memes that can be pronounced .
Then there &apos;s all the other memes that can &apos;t be pronounced .
There are different species of memes .
Remember the Shakers ? Gift to be simple ?
Simple , beautiful furniture ?
And , of course , they &apos;re basically extinct now .
And one of the reasons is that among the creed of Shaker-dom is that one should be celibate .
Not just the priests . Everybody .
Well , it &apos;s not so surprising that they &apos;ve gone extinct .
But in fact that &apos;s not why they went extinct .
They survived as long as they did at a time when the social safety nets weren &apos;t there .
And there were lots of widows and orphans , people like that , who needed a foster home .
And so they had a ready supply of converts .
And they could keep it going .
And , in principle , it could &apos;ve gone on forever , with perfect celibacy on the part of the hosts .
The idea being passed on through proselytizing , instead of through the gene line .
So the ideas can live on in spite of the fact that they &apos;re not being passed on genetically .
A meme can flourish in spite of having a negative impact on genetic fitness .
After all , the meme for Shaker-dom was essentially a sterilizing parasite .
There are other parasites that do this -- which render the host sterile .
It &apos;s part of their plan .
They don &apos;t have to have minds to have a plan .
I &apos;m just going to draw your attention to just one of the many implications of the memetic perspective , which I recommend .
I &apos;ve not time to go into more of it .
In Jared Diamond &apos;s wonderful book , &quot; Guns , Germs and Steel , &quot; he talks about how it was germs , more than guns and steel , that conquered the new hemisphere -- the Western hemisphere -- that conquered the rest of the world .
When European explorers and travelers spread out , they brought with them the germs that they had become essentially immune to , that they had learned how to tolerate over hundreds and hundreds of years , thousands of years , of living with domesticated animals who were the sources of those pathogens .
And they just wiped out -- these pathogens just wiped out the native people , who had no immunity to them at all .
And we &apos;re doing it again .
We &apos;re doing it this time with toxic ideas .
Yesterday , a number of people -- Nicholas Negroponte and others -- spoke about all the wonderful things that are happening when our ideas get spread out , thanks to all the new technology all over the world .
And I agree . It is largely wonderful . Largely wonderful .
But among all those ideas that inevitably flow out into the whole world thanks to our technology , are a lot of toxic ideas .
Now , this has been realized for some time .
Sayyid Qutb is one of the founding fathers of fanatical Islam , one of the ideologues that inspired Osama bin Laden .
&quot; One has only to glance at its press films , fashion shows , beauty contests , ballrooms , wine bars and broadcasting stations . &quot; Memes .
These memes are spreading around the world and they are wiping out whole cultures .
They are wiping out languages .
They are wiping out traditions and practices .
And it &apos;s not our fault , anymore than it &apos;s our fault when our germs lay waste to people that haven &apos;t developed the immunity .
We have an immunity to all of the junk that lies around the edges of our culture .
We &apos;re a free society , so we let pornography and all these things -- we shrug them off .
They &apos;re like a mild cold .
They &apos;re not a big deal for us .
But we should recognize that for many people in the world , they are a big deal .
And we should be very alert to this .
As we spread our education and our technology , one of the things that we are doing is we &apos;re the vectors of memes that are correctly viewed by the hosts of many other memes as a dire threat to their favorite memes -- the memes that they are prepared to die for .
Well now , how are we going to tell the good memes from the bad memes ?
That is not the job of the science of memetics .
Memetics is morally neutral . And so it should be .
This is not the place for hate and anger .
If you &apos;ve had a friend who &apos;s died of AIDS , then you hate HIV .
But the way to deal with that is to do science , and understand how it spreads and why in a morally neutral perspective .
Get the facts .
Work out the implications .
There &apos;s plenty of room for moral passion once we &apos;ve got the facts and can figure out the best thing to do .
And , as with germs , the trick is not to try to annihilate them .
You will never annihilate the germs .
What you can do , however , is foster public health measures and the like that will encourage the evolution of avirulence .
That will encourage the spread of relatively benign mutations of the most toxic varieties .
That &apos;s all the time I have , so thank you very much for your attention .

&lt; title &gt; Dan Dennett : Dangerous memes &lt; / title &gt;
&lt; description &gt; Starting with the simple tale of an ant , philosopher Dan Dennett unleashes a devastating salvo of ideas , making a powerful case for the existence of memes -- concepts that are literally alive . &lt; / description &gt;
&lt; keywords &gt; consumerism , culture , faith , meme , philosophy , religion &lt; / keywords &gt;
&lt; url &gt; http : / / www.ted.com / talks / pawan _ sinha _ on _ how _ brains _ learn _ to _ see.html &lt; / url &gt;
If you are a blind child in India , you will very likely have to contend with at least two big pieces of bad news .
The first bad news is that the chances of getting treatment are extremely slim to none , and that &apos;s because most of the blindness alleviation programs in the country are focused on adults , and there are very , very few hospitals that are actually equipped to treat children .
In fact , if you were to be treated , you might well end up being treated by a person who has no medical credentials as this case from Rajasthan illustrates .
This is a three-year-old orphan girl who had cataracts .
So , her caretakers took her to the village medicine man , and instead of suggesting to the caretakers that the girl be taken to a hospital , the person decided to burn her abdomen with red-hot iron bars to drive out the demons .
The second piece of bad news will be delivered to you by neuroscientists , who will tell you that if you are older than four or five years of age , that even if you have your eye corrected , the chances of your brain learning how to see are very , very slim -- again , slim or none .
So when I heard these two things , it troubled me deeply , both because of personal reasons and scientific reasons .
So let me first start with the personal reason .
It &apos;ll sound corny , but it &apos;s sincere .
That &apos;s my son , Darius .
As a new father , I have a qualitatively different sense of just how delicate babies are , what our obligations are towards them and how much love we can feel towards a child .
I would move heaven and earth in order to get treatment for Darius , and for me to be told that there might be other Dariuses who are not getting treatment , that &apos;s just viscerally wrong .
So that &apos;s the personal reason .
Scientific reason is that this notion from neuroscience of critical periods -- that if the brain is older than four or five years of age , it loses its ability to learn -- that doesn &apos;t sit well with me , because I don &apos;t think that idea has been tested adequately .
The birth of the idea is from David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel &apos;s work , two researchers who were at Harvard , and they got the Nobel Prize in 1981 for their studies of visual physiology , which are remarkably beautiful studies , but I believe some of their work has been extrapolated into the human domain prematurely .
So , they did their work with kittens , with different kinds of deprivation regiments , and those studies , which date back to the &apos; 60s , are now being applied to human children .
So I felt that I needed to do two things .
One : provide care to children who are currently being deprived of treatment .
That &apos;s the humanitarian mission .
And the scientific mission would be to test the limits of visual plasticity .
And these two missions , as you can tell , thread together perfectly . One adds to the other ; in fact , one would be impossible without the other .
So , to implement these twin missions , a few years ago , I launched Project Prakash .
Prakash , as many of you know , is the Sanskrit word for light , and the idea is that in bringing light into the lives of children , we also have a chance of shedding light on some of the deepest mysteries of neuroscience .
And the logo -- even though it looks extremely Irish , it &apos;s actually derived from the Indian symbol of Diya , an earthen lamp .
The Prakash , the overall effort has three components : outreach , to identify children in need of care ; medical treatment ; and in subsequent study .
And I want to show you a short video clip that illustrates the first two components of this work .
This is an outreach station conducted at a school for the blind .
Pawan Sinha : So , because this is a school for the blind , many children have permanent conditions .
That &apos;s a case of microphthalmos , which is malformed eyes , and that &apos;s a permanent condition ; it cannot be treated .
That &apos;s an extreme of micropthalmos called enophthalmos .
But , every so often , we come across children who show some residual vision , and that is a very good sign that the condition might actually be treatable .
So , after that screening , we bring the children to the hospital .
That &apos;s the hospital we &apos;re working with in Delhi , the Schroff Charity Eye Hospital .
It has a very well-equipped pediatric ophthalmic center , which was made possible in part by a gift from the Ronald McDonald charity .
So , eating burgers actually helps .
( Text : Such examinations allow us to improve eye-health in many children , and ...
... help us find children who can participate in Project Prakash . ) PS : So , as I zoom in to the eyes of this child , you will see the cause of his blindness .
The whites that you see in the middle of his pupils are congenital cataracts , so opacities of the lens .
In our eyes , the lens is clear , but in this child , the lens has become opaque , and therefore he can &apos;t see the world .
So , the child is given treatment . You &apos;ll see shots of the eye .
Here &apos;s the eye with the opaque lens , the opaque lens extracted and an acrylic lens inserted .
And here &apos;s the same child three weeks post-operation , with the right eye open .
Thank you .
So , even from that little clip , you can begin to get the sense that recovery is possible , and we have now provided treatment to over 200 children , and the story repeats itself .
After treatment , the child gains significant functionality .
In fact , the story holds true even if you have a person who got sight after several years of deprivation .
We did a paper a few years ago about this woman that you see on the right , SRD , and she got her sight late in life , and her vision is remarkable at this age .
I should add a tragic postscript to this -- she died two years ago in a bus accident .
So , hers is just a truly inspiring story -- unknown , but inspiring story .
So when we started finding these results , as you might imagine , it created quite a bit of stir in the scientific and the popular press .
Here &apos;s an article in Nature that profiled this work , and another one in Time .
So , we were fairly convinced -- we are convinced -- that recovery is feasible , despite extended visual deprivation .
The next obvious question to ask : What is the process of recovery ?
So , the way we study that is , let &apos;s say we find a child who has light sensitivity .
The child is provided treatment , and I want to stress that the treatment is completely unconditional ; there is no quid pro quo .
We treat many more children then we actually work with .
Every child who needs treatment is treated .
After treatment , about every week , we run the child on a battery of simple visual tests in order to see how their visual skills are coming on line .
And we try to do this for as long as possible .
This arc of development gives us unprecedented and extremely valuable information about how the scaffolding of vision gets set up .
What might be the causal connections between the early developing skills and the later developing ones ?
And we &apos;ve used this general approach to study many different visual proficiencies , but I want to highlight one particular one , and that is image parsing into objects .
So , any image of the kind that you see on the left , be it a real image or a synthetic image , it &apos;s made up of little regions that you see in the middle column , regions of different colors , different luminances .
The brain has this complex task of putting together , integrating , subsets of these regions into something that &apos;s more meaningful , into what we would consider to be objects , as you see on the right .
And nobody knows how this integration happens , and that &apos;s the question we asked with Project Prakash .
So , here &apos;s what happens very soon after the onset of sight .
Here &apos;s a person who had gained sight just a couple of weeks ago , and you see Ethan Myers , a graduate student from MIT , running the experiment with him .
His visual-motor coordination is quite poor , but you get a general sense of what are the regions that he &apos;s trying to trace out .
If you show him real world images , if you show others like him real world images , they are unable to recognize most of the objects because the world to them is over-fragmented ; it &apos;s made up of a collage , a patchwork , of regions of different colors and luminances .
And that &apos;s what &apos;s indicated in the green outlines .
When you ask them , &quot; Even if you can &apos;t name the objects , just point to where the objects are , &quot; these are the regions that they point to .
So the world is this complex patchwork of regions .
Even the shadow on the ball becomes its own object .
Interestingly enough , you give them a few months , and this is what happens .
Doctor : How many are these ?
Patient : These are two things .
Doctor : What are their shapes ?
Patient : Their shapes ...
This one is a circle , and this is a square .
PS : A very dramatic transformation has come about .
And the question is : What underlies this transformation ?
It &apos;s a profound question , and what &apos;s even more amazing is how simple the answer is .
The answer lies in motion and that &apos;s what I want to show you in the next clip .
Doctor : What shape do you see here ?
Patient : I can &apos;t make it out .
Doctor : Now ?
Patient : Triangle .
Doctor : How many things are these ?
Now , how many things are these ?
Patient : Two .
Doctor : What are these things ?
Patient : A square and a circle .
PS : And we see this pattern over and over again .
The one thing the visual system needs in order to begin parsing the world is dynamic information .
So the inference we are deriving from this , and several such experiments , is that dynamic information processing , or motion processing , serves as the bedrock for building the rest of the complexity of visual processing ; it leads to visual integration and eventually to recognition .
This simple idea has far reaching implications .
And let me just quickly mention two , one , drawing from the domain of engineering , and one from the clinic .
So , from the perspective of engineering , we can ask : Goven that we know that motion is so important for the human visual system , can we use this as a recipe for constructing machine-based vision systems that can learn on their own , that don &apos;t need to be programmed by a human programmer ?
And that &apos;s what we &apos;re trying to do .
I &apos;m at MIT , at MIT you need to apply whatever basic knowledge you gain .
So we are creating Dylan , which is a computational system with an ambitious goal of taking in visual inputs of the same kind that a human child would receive , and autonomously discovering : What are the objects in this visual input ?
So , don &apos;t worry about the internals of Dylan .
Here , I &apos;m just going to talk about how we test Dylan .
The way we test Dylan is by giving it inputs , as I said , of the same kind that a baby , or a child in Project Prakash would get .
But for a long time we couldn &apos;t quite figure out : Wow can we get these kinds of video inputs ?
So , I thought , could we have Darius serve as our babycam carrier , and that way get the inputs that we feed into Dylan ?
So that &apos;s what we did .
I had to have long conversations with my wife .
In fact , Pam , if you &apos;re watching this , please forgive me .
So , we modified the optics of the camera in order to mimic the baby &apos;s visual acuity .
As some of you might know , babyies are born pretty much legally blind .
Their acuity -- our acuity is 20 / 20 ; babies &apos; acuity is like 20 / 800 , so they are looking at the world in a very , very blurry fashion .
Here &apos;s what a baby-cam video looks like .
Thankfully , there isn &apos;t any audio to go with this .
What &apos;s amazing is that working with such highly degraded input , the baby , very quickly , is able to discover meaning in such input .
But then two or three days afterward , babies begin to pay attention to their mother &apos;s or their father &apos;s face .
How does that happen ? We want Dylan to be able to do that , and using this mantra of motion , Dylan actually can do that .
So , given that kind of video input , with just about six or seven minutes worth of video , Dylan can begin to extract patterns that include faces .
So , it &apos;s an important demonstration of the power of motion .
The clinical implication , it comes from the domain of autism .
Visual integration has been associated with autism by several researchers .
When we saw that , we asked : Could the impairment in visual integration be the manifestation of something underneath , of dynamic information processing deficiencies in autism ?
Because , if that hypothesis were to be true , it would have massive repercussions in our understanding of what &apos;s causing the many different aspects of the autism phenotype .
What you &apos;re going to see are video clips of two children -- one neurotypical , one with autism , playing Pong .
So , while the child is playing Pong , we are tracking where they &apos;re looking .
In red are the eye movement traces .
This is the neurotypical child , and what you see is that the child is able to make cues of the dynamic information to predict where the ball is going to go .
Even before the ball gets to a place , the child is already looking there .
Contrast this with a child with autism playing the same game .
Instead of anticipating , the child always follows where the ball has been .
The efficiency of the use of dynamic information seems to be significantly compromised in autism .
So we are pursuing this line of work and hopefully we &apos;ll have more results to report soon .
Looking ahead , if you think of this disk as representing all of the children we &apos;ve treated so far , this is the magnitude of the problem .
The red dots are the children we have not treated .
So , there are many , many more children who need to be treated , and in order to expand the scope of the project , we are planning on launching The Prakash Center for Children , which will have a dedicated pediatric hospital , a school for the children we are treating and also a cutting-edge research facility .
The Prakash Center will integrate health care , education and research in a way that truly creates the whole to be greater than the sum of the parts .
So , to summarize : Prakash , in its five years of existence , it &apos;s had an impact in multiple areas , ranging from basic neuroscience plasticity and learning in the brain , to clinically relevant hypotheses like in autism , the development of autonomous machine vision systems , education of the undergraduate and graduate students , and most importantly in the alleviation of childhood blindness .
And for my students and I , it &apos;s been just a phenomenal experience because we have gotten to do interesting research , while at the same time helping the many children that we have worked with .
Thank you very much .

What is going on in this baby &apos;s mind ?
If you &apos;d asked people this 30 years ago , most people , including psychologists , would have said that this baby was irrational , illogical , egocentric -- that he couldn &apos;t take the perspective of another person or understand cause and effect .
In the last 20 years , developmental science has completely overturned that picture .
So in some ways , we think that this baby &apos;s thinking is like the thinking of the most brilliant scientists .
Let me give you just one example of this .
One thing that this baby could be thinking about , that could be going on in his mind , is trying to figure out what &apos;s going on in the mind of that other baby .
After all , one of the things that &apos;s hardest for all of us to do is to figure out what other people are thinking and feeling .
And maybe the hardest thing of all is to figure out that what other people think and feel isn &apos;t actually exactly like what we think and feel .
Anyone who &apos;s followed politics can testify to how hard that is for some people to get .
We wanted to know if babies and young children could understand this really profound thing about other people .
Now the question is : How could we ask them ?
Babies , after all , can &apos;t talk , and if you ask a three year-old to tell you what he thinks , what you &apos;ll get is a beautiful stream of consciousness monologue about ponies and birthdays and things like that .
So how do we actually ask them the question ?
Well it turns out that the secret was broccoli .
What we did -- Betty Rapacholi , who was one of my students , and I -- was actually to give the babies two bowls of food : one bowl of raw broccoli and one bowl of delicious goldfish crackers .
Now all of the babies , even in Berkley , like the crackers and don &apos;t like the raw broccoli .
But then what Betty did was to take a little taste of food from each bowl .
And she would act as if she liked it or she didn &apos;t .
So half the time , she acted as if she liked the crackers and didn &apos;t like the broccoli -- just like a baby and any other sane person .
But half the time , what she would do is take a little bit of the broccoli and go , &quot; Mmmmm , broccoli .
I tasted the broccoli . Mmmmm . &quot;
And then she would take a little bit of the crackers , and she &apos;d go , &quot; Eww , yuck , crackers .
I tasted the crackers . Eww , yuck . &quot;
So she &apos;d act as if what she wanted was just the opposite of what the babies wanted .
We did this with 15 and 18 month-old babies .
And then she would simply put her hand out and say , &quot; Can you give me some ? &quot;
So the question is : What would the baby give her , what they liked or what she liked ?
And the remarkable thing was that 18 month-old babies , just barely walking and talking , would give her the crackers if she liked the crackers , but they would give her the broccoli if she liked the broccoli .
On the other hand , 15 month-olds would stare at her for a long time if she acted as if she liked the broccoli , like they couldn &apos;t figure this out .
But then after they stared for a long time , they would just give her the crackers , what they thought everybody must like .
So there are two really remarkable things about this .
The first one is that these little 18 month-old babies have already discovered this really profound fact about human nature , that we don &apos;t always want the same thing .
And what &apos;s more , they felt that they should actually do things to help other people get what they wanted .
Even more remarkably though , the fact that 15 month-olds didn &apos;t do this suggests that these 18 month-olds had learned this deep , profound fact about human nature in the three months from when they were 15 months old .
So children both know more and learn more than we ever would have thought .
And this is just one of hundreds and hundreds of studies over the last 20 years that &apos;s actually demonstrated it .
The question you might ask though is : Why do children learn so much ?
And how is it possible for them to learn so much in such a short time ?
I mean , after all , if you look at babies superficially , they seem pretty useless .
And actually in many ways , they &apos;re worse than useless , because we have to put so much time and energy into just keeping them alive .
But if we turn to evolution for an answer to this puzzle of why we spend so much time taking care of useless babies , it turns out that there &apos;s actually an answer .
If we look across many , many different species of animals , not just us primates , but also including other mammals , birds , even marsupials like kangaroos and wombats , it turns out that there &apos;s a relationship between how long a childhood a species has and how big their brains are compared to their bodies and how smart and flexible they are .
And sort of the posterbirds for this idea are the birds up there .
On one side is a New Caledonian crow .
And crows and other corvidae , ravens , rooks and so forth , are incredibly smart birds .
They &apos;re as smart as chimpanzees in some respects .
And this is a bird on the cover of science who &apos;s learned how to use a tool to get food .
On the other hand , we have our friend the domestic chicken .
And chickens and ducks and geese and turkeys are basically as dumb as dumps .
So they &apos;re very , very good at pecking for grain , and they &apos;re not much good at doing anything else .
Well it turns out that the babies , the New Caledonian crow babies , are fledglings .
They depend on their moms to drop worms in their little open mouths for as long as two years , which is a really long time in the life of a bird .
Whereas the chickens are actually mature within a couple of months .
So childhood is the reason why the crows end up on the cover of Science and the chickens end up in the soup pot .
There &apos;s something about that long childhood that seems to be connected to knowledge and learning .
Well what kind of explanation could we have for this ?
Well some animals , like the chicken , seem to be beautifully suited to doing just one thing very well .
So they seem to be beautifully suited to pecking grain in one environment .
Other creatures , like the crows , aren &apos;t very good at doing anything in particular , but they &apos;re extremely good at learning about laws of different environments .
And of course , we human beings are way out on the end of the distribution like the crows .
We have bigger brains relative to our bodies by far than any other animal .
We &apos;re smarter , we &apos;re more flexible , we can learn more , we survive in more different environments , we migrated to cover the world and even go to outer space .
And our babies and children are dependent on us for much longer than the babies of any other species .
My son is 23 .
And at least until they &apos;re 23 , we &apos;re still popping those worms into those little open mouths .
All right , why would we see this correlation ?
Well an idea is that that strategy , that learning strategy , is an extremely powerful , great strategy for getting on in the world , but it has one big disadvantage .
And that one big disadvantage is that , until you actually do all that learning , you &apos;re going to be helpless .
So you don &apos;t want to have the mastodon charging at you and be saying to yourself , &quot; A slingshot or maybe a spear might work . Which would actually be better ? &quot;
You want to know all that before the mastodons actually show up .
And the way the evolutions seems to have solved that problem is with a kind of division of labor .
So the idea is that we have this early period when we &apos;re completely protected .
We don &apos;t have to do anything . All we have to do is learn .
And then as adults , we can take all those things that we learned when we were babies and children and actually put them to work to do things out there in the world .
So one way of thinking about it is that babies and young children are like the research and development division of the human species .
So they &apos;re the protected blue sky guys who just have to go out and learn and have good ideas , and we &apos;re production and marketing .
We have to take all those ideas that we learned when we were children and actually put them to use .
Another way of thinking about it is instead of thinking of babies and children as being like defective grownups , we should think about them as being a different developmental stage of the same species -- kind of like caterpillars and butterflies -- except that they &apos;re actually the brilliant butterflies who are flitting around the garden and exploring , and we &apos;re the caterpillars who are inching along our narrow , grownup , adult path .
If this is true , if these babies are designed to learn -- and this evolutionary story would say children are for learning , that &apos;s what they &apos;re for -- we might expect that they would have really powerful learning mechanisms .
And in fact , the baby &apos;s brain seems to be the most powerful learning computer on the planet .
But real computers are actually getting to be a lot better .
And there &apos;s been a revolution in our understanding of machine learning recently .
And it all depends on the ideas of this guy , the Reverend Thomas Bayes , who was a statistician and mathematician in the 18th century .
And essentially what Bayes did was to provide a mathematical way using probability theory to characterize , describe , the way that scientists find out about the world .
So what scientists do is they have a hypothesis that they think might be likely to start with .
They go out and test it against the evidence .
The evidence makes them change that hypothesis .
Then they test that new hypothesis and so on and so forth .
And what Bayes showed was a mathematical way that you could do that .
And that mathematics is at the core of the best machine learning programs that we have now .
And some 10 years ago , I suggested that babies might be doing the same thing .
So if you want to know what &apos;s going on underneath those beautiful brown eyes , I think it actually looks something like this .
This is Reverend Bayes &apos;s notebook .
So I think those babies are actually making complicated calculations with conditional probabilities that they &apos;re revising to figure out how the world works .
All right , now that might seem like an even taller order to actually demonstrate .
Because after all , if you ask even grownups about statistics , they look extremely stupid .
How could it be that children are doing statistics ?
So to test this we used a machine that we have called the Blicket Detector .
This is a box that lights up and plays music when you put some things on it and not others .
And using this very simple machine , my lab and others have done dozens of studies showing just how good babies are at learning about the world .
Let me mention just one that we did with Tumar Kushner , my student .
If I showed you this detector , you would be likely to think to begin with that the way to make the detector go would be to put a block on top of the detector .
But actually , this detector works in a bit of a strange way .
Because if you wave a block over the top of the detector , something you wouldn &apos;t ever think of to begin with , the detector will actually activate two out of three times .
Whereas , if you do the likely thing , put the block on the detector , it will only activate two out of six times .
So the unlikely hypothesis actually has stronger evidence .
It looks as if the waving is a more effective strategy than the other strategy .
So we did just this ; we gave four year-olds this pattern of evidence , and we just asked them to make it go .
And sure enough , the four year-olds used the evidence to wave the object on top of the detector .
Now there are two things that are really interesting about this .
The first one is , again , remember , these are four year-olds .
They &apos;re just learning how to count .
But unconsciously , they &apos;re doing these quite complicated calculations that will give them a conditional probability measure .
And the other interesting thing is that they &apos;re using that evidence to get to an idea , get to a hypothesis about the world , that seems very unlikely to begin with .
And in studies we &apos;ve just been doing in my lab , similar studies , we &apos;ve show that four year-olds are actually better at finding out an unlikely hypothesis than adults are when we give them exactly the same task .
So in these circumstances , the children are using statistics to find out about the world , but after all , scientists also do experiments , and we wanted to see if children are doing experiments .
When children do experiments we call it &quot; getting into everything &quot; or else &quot; playing . &quot;
And there &apos;s been a bunch of interesting studies recently that have shown this playing around is really a kind of experimental research program .
Here &apos;s one from Cristine Legare &apos;s lab .
What Cristine did was use our Blicket Detectors .
And what she did was show children that yellow ones made it go and red ones didn &apos;t , and then she showed them an anomaly .
And what you &apos;ll see is that this little boy will go through five hypotheses in the space of two minutes .
Boy : How about this ?
Same as the other side .
Alison Gopnik : Okay , so his first hypothesis has just been falsified .
Boy : This one lighted up , and this one nothing .
AG : Okay , he &apos;s got his experimental notebook out .
Boy : What &apos;s making this light up .
I don &apos;t know .
AG : Every scientist will recognize that expression of despair .
Boy : Oh , it &apos;s because this needs to be like this , and this needs to be like this .
AG : Okay , hypothesis two .
Boy : That &apos;s why .
Oh .
AG : Now this is his next idea .
He told the experimenter to do this , to try putting it out onto the other location .
Not working either .
Boy : Oh , because the light goes only to here , not here .
Oh , the bottom of this box has electricity in here , but this doesn &apos;t have electricity .
AG : Okay , that &apos;s a fourth hypothesis .
Boy : It &apos;s lighting up .
So when you put four .
So you put four on this one to make it light up and two on this one to make it light up .
AG : Okay , there &apos;s his fifth hypothesis .
Now that is a particularly -- that is a particularly adorable and articulate little boy , but what Cristine discovered is this is actually quite typical .
If you look at the way children play , when you ask them to explain something , what they really do is do a series of experiments .
This is actually pretty typical of four year-olds .
Well , what &apos;s it like to be this kind of creature ?
What &apos;s it like to be one of these brilliant butterflies who can test five hypotheses in two minutes ?
Well , if you go back to those psychologists and philosophers , a lot of them have said that babies and young children were barely conscious if they were conscious at all .
And I think just the opposite is true .
I think babies and children are actually more conscious than we are as adults .
Now here &apos;s what we know about how adult consciousness works .
And adults &apos; attention and consciousness look kind of like a spotlight .
So what happens for adults is we decide that something &apos;s relevant or important , we should pay attention to it .
Our consciousness of that thing that we &apos;re attending to becomes extremely bright and vivid , and everything else sort of goes dark .
And we even know something about the way the brain does this .
So what happens when we pay attention is that the prefrontal cortex , the sort of executive part of our brains , sends a signal that makes a little part of our brain much more flexible , more plastic , better at learning , and shuts down activity in all the rest of our brains .
So we have a very focused , purpose-driven kind of attention .
If we look at babies and young children , we see something very different .
I think babies and young children seem to have more of a lantern of consciousness than a spotlight of consciousness .
So babies and young children are very bad at narrowing down to just one thing .
But they &apos;re very good at taking in lots of information from lots of different sources at once .
And if you actually look in their brains , you see that they &apos;re flooded with these neurotransmitters that are really good at inducing learning and plasticity , and the inhibitory parts haven &apos;t come on yet .
So when we say that babies and young children are bad at paying attention , what we really mean is that they &apos;re bad at not paying attention .
So they &apos;re bad at getting rid of all the interesting things that could tell them something and just looking at the thing that &apos;s important .
That &apos;s the kind of attention , the kind of consciousness , that we might expect from those butterflies who are designed to learn .
Well if we want to think about a way of getting a taste of that kind of baby consciousness as adults , I think the best thing is think about cases where we &apos;re put in a new situation that we &apos;ve never been in before -- when we fall in love with someone new , or when we &apos;re in a new city for the first time .
And what happens then is not that our consciousness contracts , it expands , so that those three days in Paris seem to be more full of consciousness and experience than all the months of being a walking , talking , faculty meeting-attending zombie back home .
And by the way , that coffee , that wonderful coffee you &apos;ve been drinking downstairs , actually mimics the effect of those baby neurotransmitters .
So what &apos;s it like to be a baby ?
It &apos;s like being in love in Paris for the first time after you &apos;ve had three double-espressos .
That &apos;s a fantastic way to be , but it does tend to leave you waking up crying at three o &apos;clock in the morning .
Now it &apos;s good to be a grownup .
I don &apos;t want to say too much about how wonderful babies are .
It &apos;s good to be a grownup .
We can do things like tie our shoelaces and cross the street by ourselves .
And it makes sense that we put a lot of effort into making babies think like adults do .
But if what we want is to be like those butterflies , to have open-mindedness , open learning , imagination , creativity , innovation , maybe at least some of the time we should be getting the adults to start thinking more like children .

When you have 21 minutes to speak , two million years seems like a really long time .
But evolutionarily , two million years is nothing .
And yet in two million years the human brain has nearly tripled in mass , going from the one-and-a-quarter pound brain of our ancestor here , Habilis , to the almost three-pound meatloaf that everybody here has between their ears .
What is it about a big brain that nature was so eager for every one of us to have one ?
Well , it turns out when brains triple in size , they don &apos;t just get three times bigger ; they gain new structures .
And one of the main reasons our brain got so big is because it got a new part , called the &quot; frontal lobe . &quot; And particularly , a part called the &quot; pre-frontal cortex . &quot;
Now what does a pre-frontal cortex do for you that should justify the entire architectural overhaul of the human skull in the blink of evolutionary time ?
Well , it turns out the pre-frontal cortex does lots of things , but one of the most important things it does is it is an experience simulator .
Flight pilots practice in flight simulators so that they don &apos;t make real mistakes in planes .
Human beings have this marvelous adaptation that they can actually have experiences in their heads before they try them out in real life .
This is a trick that none of our ancestors could do , and that no other animal can do quite like we can . It &apos;s a marvelous adaptation .
It &apos;s up there with opposable thumbs and standing upright and language as one of the things that got our species out of the trees and into the shopping mall .
Now -- -- all of you have done this .
I mean , you know , Ben and Jerry &apos;s doesn &apos;t have liver-and-onion ice cream , and it &apos;s not because they whipped some up , tried it and went , &quot; Yuck . &quot;
It &apos;s because , without leaving your armchair , you can simulate that flavor and say &quot; yuck &quot; before you make it .
Let &apos;s see how your experience simulators are working .
Let &apos;s just run a quick diagnostic before I proceed with the rest of the talk .
Here &apos;s two different futures that I invite you to contemplate , and you can try to simulate them and tell me which one you think you might prefer .
One of them is winning the lottery . This is about 314 million dollars .
And the other is becoming paraplegic .
So , just give it a moment of thought .
You probably don &apos;t feel like you need a moment of thought .
Interestingly , there are data on these two groups of people , data on how happy they are .
And this is exactly what you expected , isn &apos;t it ?
But these aren &apos;t the data . I made these up !
These are the data . You failed the pop quiz , and you &apos;re hardly five minutes into the lecture .
Because the fact is that a year after losing the use of their legs , and a year after winning the lotto , lottery winners and paraplegics are equally happy with their lives .
Now , don &apos;t feel too bad about failing the first pop quiz , because everybody fails all of the pop quizzes all of the time .
The research that my laboratory has been doing , that economists and psychologists around the country have been doing , have revealed something really quite startling to us , something we call the &quot; impact bias , &quot; which is the tendency for the simulator to work badly .
For the simulator to make you believe that different outcomes are more different than in fact they really are .
From field studies to laboratory studies , we see that winning or losing an election , gaining or losing a romantic partner , getting or not getting a promotion , passing or not passing a college test , on and on , have far less impact , less intensity and much less duration than people expect them to have .
In fact , a recent study -- this almost floors me -- a recent study showing how major life traumas affect people suggests that if it happened over three months ago , with only a few exceptions , it has no impact whatsoever on your happiness .
Why ?
Because happiness can be synthesized .
Sir Thomas Brown wrote in 1642 , &quot; I am the happiest man alive .
I have that in me that can convert poverty to riches , adversity to prosperity .
I am more invulnerable than Achilles ; fortune hath not one place to hit me . &quot;
What kind of remarkable machinery does this guy have in his head ?
Well , it turns out it &apos;s precisely the same remarkable machinery that all off us have .
Human beings have something that we might think of as a &quot; psychological immune system . &quot;
A system of cognitive processes , largely non-conscious cognitive processes , that help them change their views of the world , so that they can feel better about the worlds in which they find themselves .
Like Sir Thomas , you have this machine .
Unlike Sir Thomas , you seem not to know it .
We synthesize happiness , but we think happiness is a thing to be found .
Now , you don &apos;t need me to give you too many examples of people synthesizing happiness , I suspect . Though I &apos;m going to show you some experimental evidence , you don &apos;t have to look very far for evidence .
As a challenge to myself , since I say this once in a while in lectures , I took a copy of the New York Times and tried to find some instances of people synthesizing happiness .
And here are three guys synthesizing happiness .
&quot; I am so much better off physically , financially , emotionally , mentally and almost every other way . &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have one minute &apos;s regret .
It was a glorious experience . &quot; &quot; I believe it turned out for the best . &quot;
Who are these characters who are so damn happy ?
Well , the first one is Jim Wright .
Some of you are old enough to remember : he was the chairman of the House of Representatives and he resigned in disgrace when this young Republican named Newt Gingrich found out about a shady book deal he had done .
He lost everything . The most powerful Democrat in the country , he lost everything .
He lost his money ; he lost his power .
What does he have to say all these years later about it ?
&quot; I am so much better off physically , financially , mentally and in almost every other way . &quot;
What other way would there be to be better off ?
Vegetably ? Minerally ? Animally ? He &apos;s pretty much covered them there .
Moreese Bickham is somebody you &apos;ve never heard of .
Moreese Bickham uttered these words upon being released .
He was 78 years old . He spent 37 years in a Louisiana State Penitentiary for a crime he didn &apos;t commit .
He was ultimately exonerated , at the age of 78 , through DNA evidence .
And what did he have to say about his experience ?
&quot; I don &apos;t have one minute &apos;s regret . It was a glorious experience . &quot;
Glorious ! This guy is not saying , &quot; Well , you know , there were some nice guys . They had a gym . &quot;
It &apos;s &quot; glorious , &quot; a word we usually reserve for something like a religious experience .
Harry S. Langerman uttered these words , and he &apos;s somebody you might have known but didn &apos;t , because in 1949 he read a little article in the paper about a hamburger stand owned by these two brothers named McDonalds .
And he thought , &quot; That &apos;s a really neat idea ! &quot;
So he went to find them . They said , &quot; We can give you a franchise on this for 3,000 bucks . &quot;
Harry went back to New York , asked his brother who &apos;s an investment banker to loan him the 3,000 dollars , and his brother &apos;s immortal words were , &quot; You idiot , nobody eats hamburgers . &quot;
He wouldn &apos;t lend him the money , and of course six months later Ray Croc had exactly the same idea .
It turns out people do eat hamburgers , and Ray Croc , for a while , became the richest man in America .
And then finally -- you know , the best of all possible worlds -- some of you recognize this young photo of Pete Best , who was the original drummer for the Beatles , until they , you know , sent him out on an errand and snuck away and picked up Ringo on a tour .
Well , in 1994 , when Pete Best was interviewed -- yes , he &apos;s still a drummer ; yes , he &apos;s a studio musician -- he had this to say : &quot; I &apos;m happier than I would have been with the Beatles . &quot;
Okay . There &apos;s something important to be learned from these people , and it is the secret of happiness .
Here it is , finally to be revealed .
First : accrue wealth , power , and prestige , then lose it .
Second : spend as much of your life in prison as you possibly can .
Third : make somebody else really , really rich .
And finally : never ever join the Beatles .
OK . Now I , like Ze Frank , can predict your next thought , which is , &quot; Yeah , right . &quot; Because when people synthesize happiness , as these gentlemen seem to have done , we all smile at them , but we kind of roll our eyes and say , &quot; Yeah right , you never really wanted the job . &quot;
&quot; Oh yeah , right . You really didn &apos;t have that much in common with her , and you figured that out just about the time she threw the engagement ring in your face . &quot;
We smirk because we believe that synthetic happiness is not of the same quality as what we might call &quot; natural happiness . &quot;
What are these terms ?
Natural happiness is what we get when we get what we wanted , and synthetic happiness is what we make when we don &apos;t get what we wanted .
And in our society , we have a strong belief that synthetic happiness is of an inferior kind .
Why do we have that belief ?
Well , it &apos;s very simple . What kind of economic engine would keep churning if we believed that not getting what we want could make us just as happy as getting it ?
With all apologies to my friend Matthieu Ricard , a shopping mall full of Zen monks is not going to be particularly profitable because they don &apos;t want stuff enough .
I want to suggest to you that synthetic happiness is every bit as real and enduring as the kind of happiness you stumble upon when you get exactly what you were aiming for .
Now , I &apos;m a scientist , so I &apos;m going to do this not with rhetoric , but by marinating you in a little bit of data .
Let me first show you an experimental paradigm that is used to demonstrate the synthesis of happiness among regular old folks . And this isn &apos;t mine .
This is a 50-year-old paradigm called the &quot; free choice paradigm . &quot;
It &apos;s very simple .
You bring in , say , six objects , and you ask a subject to rank them from the most to the least liked .
In this case , because the experiment I &apos;m going to tell you about uses them , these are Monet prints .
So , everybody can rank these Monet prints from the one they like the most , to the one they like the least .
Now we give you a choice : &quot; We happen to have some extra prints in the closet .
We &apos;re going to give you one as your prize to take home .
We happen to have number three and number four , &quot; we tell the subject . This is a bit of a difficult choice , because neither one is preferred strongly to the other , but naturally , people tend to pick number three because they liked it a little better than number four .
Sometime later -- it could be 15 minutes ; it could be 15 days -- the same stimuli are put before the subject , and the subject is asked to re-rank the stimuli .
&quot; Tell us how much you like them now . &quot;
What happens ? Watch as happiness is synthesized .
This is the result that has been replicated over and over again .
You &apos;re watching happiness be synthesized .
Would you like to see it again ? Happiness !
&quot; The one I got is really better than I thought !
That other one I didn &apos;t get sucks ! &quot;
That &apos;s the synthesis of happiness .
Now what &apos;s the right response to that ? &quot; Yeah , right ! &quot;
Now , here &apos;s the experiment we did , and I would hope this is going to convince you that &quot; Yeah , right ! &quot; was not the right response .
We did this experiment with a group of patients who had anterograde amnesia . These are hospitalized patients .
Most of them have Korsakoff &apos;s syndrome , a polyneuritic psychosis that -- they drank way too much , and they can &apos;t make new memories .
OK ? They remember their childhood , but if you walk in and introduce yourself , and then leave the room , when you come back , they don &apos;t know who you are .
We took our Monet prints to the hospital .
And we asked these patients to rank them from the one they liked the most to the one they liked the least .
We then gave them the choice between number three and number four .
Like everybody else , they said , &quot; Gee , thanks Doc ! That &apos;s great ! I could use a new print .
I &apos;ll take number three . &quot;
We explained we would have number three mailed to them .
We gathered up our materials and we went out of the room , and counted to a half hour .
Back into the room , we say , &quot; Hi , we &apos;re back . &quot;
The patients , bless them , say , &quot; Ah , Doc , I &apos;m sorry , I &apos;ve got a memory problem ; that &apos;s why I &apos;m here .
If I &apos;ve met you before , I don &apos;t remember . &quot;
&quot; Really , Jim , you don &apos;t remember ? I was just here with the Monet prints ? &quot;
&quot; Sorry , Doc , I just don &apos;t have a clue . &quot;
&quot; No problem , Jim . All I want you to do is rank these for me from the one you like the most to the one you like the least . &quot;
What do they do ? Well , let &apos;s first check and make sure they &apos;re really amnesiac . We ask these amnesiac patients to tell us which one they own , which one they chose last time , which one is theirs .
And what we find is amnesiac patients just guess .
These are normal controls , where if I did this with you , all of you would know which print you chose .
But if I do this with amnesiac patients , they don &apos;t have a clue . They can &apos;t pick their print out of a lineup .
Here &apos;s what normal controls do : they synthesize happiness .
Right ? This is the change in liking score , the change from the first time they ranked to the second time they ranked .
Normal controls show -- that was the magic I showed you ; now I &apos;m showing it to you in graphical form -- &quot; The one I own is better than I thought . The one I didn &apos;t own , the one I left behind , is not as good as I thought . &quot;
Amnesiacs do exactly the same thing . Think about this result .
These people like better the one they own , but they don &apos;t know they own it .
&quot; Yeah , right &quot; is not the right response !
What these people did when they synthesized happiness is they really , truly changed their affective , hedonic , aesthetic reactions to that poster .
They &apos;re not just saying it because they own it , because they don &apos;t know they own it .
Now , when psychologists show you bars , you know that they are showing you averages of lots of people .
And yet , all of us have this psychological immune system , this capacity to synthesize happiness , but some of us do this trick better than others .
And some situations allow anybody to do it more effectively than other situations do .
-- the ability to make up your mind and change your mind -- is the friend of natural happiness , because it allows you to choose among all those delicious futures and find the one that you would most enjoy .
But freedom to choose -- to change and make up your mind -- is the enemy of synthetic happiness .
And I &apos;m going to show you why .
Dilbert already knows , of course .
You &apos;re reading the cartoon as I &apos;m talking .
&quot; Dogbert &apos;s tech support . How may I abuse you ? &quot;
&quot; My printer prints a blank page after every document . &quot;
&quot; Why would you complain about getting free paper ? &quot;
&quot; Free ? Aren &apos;t you just giving me my own paper ? &quot;
&quot; Egad , man ! Look at the quality of the free paper compared to your lousy regular paper !
Only a fool or a liar would say that they look the same ! &quot;
&quot; Ah ! Now that you mention it , it does seem a little silkier ! &quot;
&quot; What are you doing ? &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m helping people accept the things they cannot change . &quot; Indeed .
The psychological immune system works best when we are totally stuck , when we are trapped .
This is the difference between dating and marriage , right ?
I mean , you go out on a date with a guy , and he picks his nose ; you don &apos;t go out on another date .
You &apos;re married to a guy and he picks his nose ?
Yeah , he has a heart of gold ; don &apos;t touch the fruitcake . Right ?
You find a way to be happy with what &apos;s happened .
Now what I want to show you is that people don &apos;t know this about themselves , and not knowing this can work to our supreme disadvantage .
Here &apos;s an experiment we did at Harvard .
We created a photography course , a black-and-white photography course , and we allowed students to come in and learn how to use a darkroom .
So we gave them cameras ; they went around campus ; they took 12 pictures of their favorite professors and their dorm room and their dog , and all the other things they wanted to have Harvard memories of .
They bring us the camera ; we make up a contact sheet ; they figure out which are the two best pictures ; and we now spend six hours teaching them about darkrooms .
And they blow two of them up , and they have two gorgeous eight-by-10 glossies of meaningful things to them , and we say , &quot; Which one would you like to give up ? &quot;
They say , &quot; I have to give one up ? &quot;
&quot; Oh , yes . We need one as evidence of the class project .
So you have to give me one . You have to make a choice .
You get to keep one , and I get to keep one . &quot;
Now , there are two conditions in this experiment .
In one case , the students are told , &quot; But you know , if you want to change your mind , I &apos;ll always have the other one here , and in the next four days , before I actually mail it to headquarters , I &apos;ll be glad to &quot; -- -- yeah , &quot; headquarters &quot; -- &quot; I &apos;ll be glad to swap it out with you . In fact , I &apos;ll come to your dorm room and give -- just give me an email . Better yet , I &apos;ll check with you .
You ever want to change your mind , it &apos;s totally returnable . &quot;
The other half of the students are told exactly the opposite : &quot; Make your choice . And by the way , the mail is going out , gosh , in two minutes , to England .
Your picture will be winging its way over the Atlantic .
You will never see it again . &quot;
Now , half of the students in each of these conditions are asked to make predictions about how much they &apos;re going to come to like the picture that they keep and the picture they leave behind .
Other students are just sent back to their little dorm rooms and they are measured over the next three to six days on their liking , satisfaction with the pictures .
And look at what we find .
First of all , here &apos;s what students think is going to happen .
They think they &apos;re going to maybe come to like the picture they chose a little more than the one they left behind , but these are not statistically significant differences .
It &apos;s a very small increase , and it doesn &apos;t much matter whether they were in the reversible or irreversible condition .
Wrong-o . Bad simulators . Because here &apos;s what &apos;s really happening .
Both right before the swap and five days later , people who are stuck with that picture , who have no choice , who can never change their mind , like it a lot !
And people who are deliberating -- &quot; Should I return it ?
Have I gotten the right one ? Maybe this isn &apos;t the good one ?
Maybe I left the good one ? &quot; -- have killed themselves .
They don &apos;t like their picture , and in fact even after the opportunity to swap has expired , they still don &apos;t like their picture . Why ?
Because the reversible condition is not conducive to the synthesis of happiness .
So here &apos;s the final piece of this experiment .
We bring in a whole new group of naive Harvard students and we say , &quot; You know , we &apos;re doing a photography course , and we can do it one of two ways .
We could do it so that when you take the two pictures , you &apos;d have four days to change your mind , or we &apos;re doing another course where you take the two pictures and you make up your mind right away and you can never change it . Which course would you like to be in ? &quot;
Duh ! 66 percent of the students , two-thirds , prefer to be in the course where they have the opportunity to change their mind .
Hello ? 66 percent of the students choose to be in the course in which they will ultimately be deeply dissatisfied with the picture .
Because they do not know the conditions under which synthetic happiness grows .
The Bard said everything best , of course , and he &apos;s making my point here but he &apos;s making it hyperbolically : &quot; &apos; Tis nothing good or bad / But thinking makes it so . &quot;
It &apos;s nice poetry , but that can &apos;t exactly be right .
Is there really nothing good or bad ?
Is it really the case that gall bladder surgery and a trip to Paris are just the same thing ? That seems like a one-question IQ test .
They can &apos;t be exactly the same .
In more turgid prose , but closer to the truth , was the father of modern capitalism , Adam Smith , and he said this .
This is worth contemplating : &quot; The great source of both the misery and disorders of human life seems to arise from overrating the difference between one permanent situation and another ...
Some of these situations may , no doubt , deserve to be preferred to others , but none of them can deserve to be pursued with that passionate ardor which drives us to violate the rules either of prudence or of justice , or to corrupt the future tranquility of our minds , either by shame from the remembrance of our own folly , or by remorse for the horror of our own injustice . &quot;
In other words : yes , some things are better than others .
We should have preferences that lead us into one future over another .
But when those preferences drive us too hard and too fast because we have overrated the difference between these futures , we are at risk .
When our ambition is bounded , it leads us to work joyfully .
When our ambition is unbounded , it leads us to lie , to cheat , to steal , to hurt others , to sacrifice things of real value . When our fears are bounded , we &apos;re prudent ; we &apos;re cautious ; we &apos;re thoughtful .
When our fears are unbounded and overblown , we &apos;re reckless , and we &apos;re cowardly .
The lesson I want to leave you with from these data is that our longings and our worries are both to some degree overblown , because we have within us the capacity to manufacture the very commodity we are constantly chasing when we choose experience .
Thank you .

By day , I &apos;m a venture capitalist . On weekends , I love rockets .
I love photography , I love rockets , and I &apos;m going to talk to you about a hobby that can scale and show you some photos that I &apos;ve taken over the years with kids like these ; kids that hopefully will grow up to love rocketry and eventually become maybe another Richard Branson or Diamandis .
My son designed a rocket that became stable , a golf ball rocket -- I thought it was quite an interesting experiment in the principles of rocket science -- and it flies straight as an arrow .
Baking soda and vinegar .
Night shots are beautiful , piercing the Big Dipper and the Milky Way .
Two stage rockets , rockets with video cameras on them , on-board computers logging their flights , rocket gliders that fly back to Earth .
I use RockSim to simulate flights before they go to see if they &apos;ll break supersonic or not , and then fly them with on-board computers to verify their performance .
But to launch the really big stuff , you go to the middle of nowhere : Black Rock Desert , where dangerous things happen .
And the boys get bigger , and the rockets get bigger .
And they use motors that literally are used on cruise missile boosters .
They rumble the belly and leave even photographers in awe watching the spectacle .
These rockets use experimental motors like nitrous oxide .
They use solid propellant most frequently .
It &apos;s a strange kind of love .
We have a RocketMavericks.com website with my photos if you want to learn more about this , participate , be a spectator .
Mavericks : we had to call it Rocket Mavericks .
This one was great : it went to 100,000 feet , but didn &apos;t quite . Actually , it went 11 feet into the solid clay ; and it became a bunker-buster , drilling down into the clay . It had to be dug out .
Rockets often spiral out of control if you put too much propellant in them .
Here was a drag race .
At night you can see what happened in a second ; in daytime , we call them land sharks .
Sometimes they just explode before your eyes or come down supersonic .
To take this shot , I do what I often do , which is go way beyond the pads where none of the other spectators are .
And if we can run the video , I &apos;ll show you what it took to get this DreamWorks shot .
Voices : Woohoo ! Yeah . Nice .
Steve Jurvetson : This is rare . Here &apos;s where they realized the computer &apos;s failed .
They &apos;re yelling deploy . Voices : Oh shit .
SJ : This is when they realize everything on board &apos;s gone haywire .
Voices : It &apos;s going ballistic . Oh shit .
SJ : And I &apos;ll just be quiet .
Voices : No .
Up , up , up .
SJ : And that &apos;s me over there , taking photos the whole way .
Things often go wrong .
Some people watch this event because of a NASCAR-like fascination with things bumping and grinding . Burning the parachute as it fell -- that was last weekend .
This guy went up , went supersonic , ripped the fin can off -- yard sale in the sky -- and a burning metal hunk coming back .
These things would drop down from above all through the weekend of rocket launch after rocket launch after rocket launch .
It &apos;s a cadence you can &apos;t quite imagine .
And in many ways , I try to capture the mishaps ; it &apos;s the challenge in photography when these things all take place in a fraction of a second .
Why do they do it ? It &apos;s for things like this : Gene from Alabama drives out there with this rocket that he &apos;s built with X-ray sensors , video cameras , festooned with electronics , and he succeeds getting to 100,000 feet , leaving the atmosphere , seeing a thin blue line of space .
It is this breathtaking image -- success , of course -- that motivates us and motivates kids to follow and understand rocket science : to understand the importance of physics and math and , in many ways , to sort of have that awe at exploration of the frontiers of the unknown .
Thank you .

Let &apos;s talk about manias .
Let &apos;s start with Beatle mania : hysterical teenagers , crying , screaming , pandemonium .
Sports mania : deafening crowds , all for one idea -- get the ball in the net .
Okay , religious mania : there &apos;s rapture , there &apos;s weeping , there &apos;s visions .
Manias can be good .
Manias can be alarming .
Or manias can be deadly .
The world has a new mania .
A mania for learning English .
Listen as Chinese students practice their English by screaming it .
Teacher : ... change my life !
Students : I will change my life .
T : I don &apos;t want to let my parents down .
S : I don &apos;t want to let my parents down .
T : I don &apos;t ever want to let my country down .
S : I don &apos;t ever want to let my country down .
T : Most importantly ... S : Most importantly ...
T : I don &apos;t want to let myself down .
S : I don &apos;t want to let myself down .
Jay Walker : How many people are trying to learn English worldwide ?
Two billion of them .
Students : A t-shirt . A dress .
JW : In Latin America , in India , in Southeast Asia , and most of all in China .
If you are a Chinese student you start learning English in the third grade , by law .
That &apos;s why this year China will become the world &apos;s largest English-speaking country .
Why English ? In a single word : Opportunity .
Opportunity for a better life , a job , to be able to pay for school , or put better food on the table .
Imagine a student taking a giant test for three full days .
Her score on this one test literally determines her future .
She studies 12 hours a day for three years to prepare .
25 percent of her grade is based on English .
It &apos;s called the Gaokao , and 80 million high school Chinese students have already taken this grueling test .
The intensity to learn English is almost unimaginable , unless you witness it .
Teacher : Perfect ! Students : Perfect !
T : Perfect ! S : Perfect !
T : I want to speak perfect English .
S : I want to speak perfect English .
T : I want to speak -- S : I want to speak -- T : perfect English . S : perfect English .
T : I want to change my life !
S : I want to change my life !
JW : So is English mania good or bad ?
Is English a tsunami , washing away other languages ? Not likely .
English is the world &apos;s second language .
Your native language is your life .
But with English you can become part of a wider conversation : a global conversation about global problems , like climate change or poverty , or hunger or disease .
The world has other universal languages .
Mathematics is the language of science .
Music is the language of emotions .
And now English is becoming the language of problem-solving .
Not because America is pushing it , but because the world is pulling it .
So English mania is a turning point .
Like the harnessing of electricity in our cities or the fall of the Berlin Wall , English represents hope for a better future -- a future where the world has a common language to solve its common problems .
Thank you very much .

In my industry , we believe that images can change the world .
Okay , we &apos;re naive , we &apos;re bright-eyed and bushy-tailed .
The truth is that we know that the images themselves don &apos;t change the world , but we &apos;re also aware that , since the beginning of photography , images have provoked reactions in people , and those reactions have caused change to happen .
So let &apos;s begin with a group of images .
I &apos;d be extremely surprised if you didn &apos;t recognize many or most of them .
They &apos;re best described as iconic : so iconic , perhaps , they &apos;re cliches .
In fact , they &apos;re so well-known that you might even recognize them in a slightly or somewhat different form .
But I think we &apos;re looking for something more .
We &apos;re looking for something more .
We &apos;re looking for images that shine an uncompromising light on crucial issues , images that transcend borders , that transcend religions , images that provoke us to step up and do something -- in other words , to act .
Well , this image you &apos;ve all seen .
It changed our view of the physical world .
We had never seen our planet from this perspective before .
Many people credit a lot of the birth of the environmental movement to our seeing the planet like this for the first time -- its smallness , its fragility .
Forty years later , this group , more than most , are well aware of the destructive power that our species can wield over our environment .
And at last , we appear to be doing something about it .
This destructive power takes many different forms .
For example , these images taken by Brent Stirton in the Congo .
These gorillas were murdered , some would even say crucified , and unsurprisingly , they sparked international outrage .
Most recently , we &apos;ve been tragically reminded of the destructive power of nature itself with the recent earthquake in Haiti .
Well , I think what is far worse is man &apos;s destructive power over man .
Samuel Pisar , an Auschwitz survivor , said , &quot; The Holocaust teaches us that nature , even in its cruelest moments , is benign in comparison with man , when he loses his moral compass and his reason . &quot;
There &apos;s another kind of crucifixion .
The horrifying images from Abu Ghraib as well as the images from Guantanamo had a profound impact .
The publication of those images , as opposed to the images themselves , caused a government to change its policies .
Some would argue that it is those images that did more to fuel the insurgency in Iraq than virtually any other single act .
Furthermore , those images forever removed the so-called moral high ground of the occupying forces .
Let &apos;s go back a little .
In the 1960s and 1970s , the Vietnam War was basically shown in America &apos;s living rooms day in , day out .
News photos brought people face to face with the victims of the war : a little girl burned by napalm , a student killed by the National Guard at Kent State University in Ohio during a protest .
In fact , these images became the voices of protest themselves .
Now , images have power to shed light of understanding on suspicion , ignorance , and in particular -- I &apos;ve given a lot of talks on this but I &apos;ll just show one image -- the issue of HIV / AIDS .
In the 1980s , the stigmatization of people with the disease was an enormous barrier to even discussing or addressing it .
A simple act , in 1987 , of the most famous woman in the world , the Princess of Wales , touching an HIV / AIDS infected baby did a great deal , especially in Europe , to stop that .
She , better than most , knew the power of an image .
So when we are confronted by a powerful image , we all have a choice : We can look away , or we can address the image .
Thankfully , when these photos appeared in The Guardian in 1998 , they put a lot of focus and attention and , in the end , a lot of money towards the Sudan famine relief efforts .
Did the images change the world ?
No , but they had a major impact .
Images often push us to question our core beliefs and our responsibilities to each other .
We all saw those images after Katrina , and I think for millions of people they had a very strong impact .
And I think it &apos;s very unlikely that they were far from the minds of Americans when they went to vote in November 2008 .
Unfortunately , some very important images are deemed too graphic or disturbing for us to see them .
I &apos;ll show you one photo here , and it &apos;s a photo by Eugene Richards of an Iraq War veteran from an extraordinary piece of work , which has never been published , called War Is Personal .
But images don &apos;t need to be graphic in order to remind us of the tragedy of war .
John Moore set up this photo at Arlington Cemetery .
After all the tense moments of conflict in all the conflict zones of the world , there &apos;s one photograph from a much quieter place that haunts me still , much more than the others .
Ansel Adams said , and I &apos;m going to disagree with him , &quot; You don &apos;t take a photograph , you make it . &quot;
In my view , it &apos;s not the photographer who makes the photo , it &apos;s you .
We bring to each image our own values , our own belief systems , and as a result of that , the image resonates with us .
My company has 70 million images .
I have one image in my office .
Here it is .
I hope that the next time you see an image that sparks something in you , you &apos;ll better understand why , and I know that speaking to this audience , you &apos;ll definitely do something about it .
And thank you to all the photographers .

I thought I &apos;d tell you a little about what I like to write .
And I like to immerse myself in my topics .
I just like to dive right in and become sort of a human guinea pig .
And I see my life as a series of experiments .
So , I work for Esquire magazine , and a couple of years ago , I wrote an article called &quot; My Outsourced Life , &quot; where I hired a team of people in Bangalore , India , to live my life for me .
So , they answered my emails .
They answered my phone .
They argued with my wife for me , and they read my son bedtime stories .
It was the best month of my life , because I just sat back and I read books and watched movies .
It was a wonderful experience .
More recently , I wrote an article for Esquire called -- about radical honesty .
And this is a movement where -- this is started by a psychologist in Virginia , who says that you should never , ever lie , except maybe during poker and golf , his only exceptions .
And , more than that , whatever is on your brain should come out of your mouth .
So , I decided I would try this for a month .
This was the worst month of my life .
I do not recommend this at all .
To give you a sense of the experience , the article was called , &quot; I Think You &apos;re Fat . &quot;
So , that was hard .
My most recent book -- my previous book was called &quot; The Know-It-All , &quot; and it was about the year I spent reading the Encyclopedia Britannica from A to Z in my quest to learn everything in the world , or more precisely from Aak , which is a type of East Asian music , all the way to Zwyiec , which is -- well , I don &apos;t want to ruin the ending .
It &apos;s a very exciting twist ending , like an O. Henry novel , so I won &apos;t ruin it .
But I love that one , because that was an experiment about how much information one human brain could absorb .
Although , listening to Kevin Kelly , you don &apos;t have to remember anything .
You can just Google it .
So , I wasted some time there .
I love those experiments , but I think that the most profound and life-changing experiment that I &apos;ve done is my most recent experiment , where I spent a year trying to follow all of the rules of the Bible , &quot; The Year of Living Biblically . &quot;
And I undertook this for two reasons .
The first was that I grew up with no religion at all .
As I say in my book , I &apos;m Jewish in the same way the Olive Garden is Italian .
So , not very .
But I &apos;ve become increasingly interested in religion .
I do think it &apos;s the defining issue of our time , or one of the main ones .
And I have a son . I want to know what to teach him .
So , I decided to dive in head first , and try to live the Bible .
The second reason I undertook this is because I &apos;m concerned about the rise of fundamentalism , religious fundamentalism , and people who say they take the Bible literally , which is , according to some polls , as high as 45 or 50 percent of America .
So I decided , what if you really did take the Bible literally ?
I decided to take it to its logical conclusion and take everything in the Bible literally , without picking and choosing .
The first thing I did was I got a stack of bibles .
I had Christian bibles .
I had Jewish bibles .
A friend of mine sent me something called a hip-hop bible , where the twenty-third Psalm is rendered as , &quot; The Lord is all that , &quot; as opposed to what I knew it as , &quot; The Lord is my shepherd . &quot;
Then I went down and I read several versions , and I wrote down every single law that I could find .
And this was a very long list -- over 700 rules .
And they range from the famous ones that I had heard of -- The Ten Commandments , love your neighbor , be fruitful and multiply .
So I wanted to follow those .
And actually , I take my projects very seriously , because I had twins during my year , so I definitely take my projects seriously .
But I also wanted to follow the hundreds of arcane and obscure laws that are in the Bible .
There is the law in Leviticus , &quot; You cannot shave the corners of your beard . &quot;
I didn &apos;t know where my corners were , so I decided to let the whole thing grow , and this is what I looked like by the end .
As you can imagine , I spent a lot of time at airport security .
My wife wouldn &apos;t kiss me for the last two months .
So , certainly the challenge was there .
The Bible says you cannot wear clothes made of mixed fibers , so I thought , &quot; Sounds strange , but I &apos;ll try it . &quot;
You only know if you try it .
I got rid of all my poly-cotton T-shirts .
The Bible says that if two men are in a fight , and the wife of one of those men grabs the testicles of the other man , then her hand shall be cut off .
So , I wanted to follow that rule .
That one I followed by default , by not getting in a fight with a man whose wife was standing nearby , looking like she had a strong grip .
So -- oh , there &apos;s another shot of my beard .
I will say it was an amazing year because it really was life changing , and incredibly challenging .
And there were two types of laws that were particularly challenging .
The first was avoiding the little sins that we all commit every day .
You know , I could spend a year not killing , but spending a year not gossiping , not coveting , not lying -- you know , I live in New York , and I work as a journalist , so this was 75 , 80 percent of my day I had to do it .
But it was really interesting , because I was able to make some progress , because I couldn &apos;t believe how much my behavior changed my thoughts .
This was one of the huge lessons of the year , is that I almost pretended to be a better person , and I became a little bit of a better person .
So I had always thought , you know , &quot; You change your mind , and you change your behavior , &quot; but it &apos;s often the other way around .
You change your behavior , and you change your mind .
So , you know , if you want to become more compassionate , you visit sick people in the hospital , and you will become more compassionate .
You donate money to a cause , and you become emotionally involved in that cause .
So , it really was cognitive psychology -- you know , cognitive dissonance -- that I was experiencing .
The Bible actually talks about cognitive psychology , very primitive cognitive psychology .
In the Proverbs , it says that if you smile , you will become happier , which , as we know , is actually true .
The second type of rule that was difficult to obey was the rules that will get you into a little trouble in twenty-first-century America .
And perhaps the clearest example of this is stoning adulterers .
But it &apos;s a big part of the Bible , so I figured I had to address it .
So , I was able to stone one adulterer .
It happened -- I was in the park , and I was dressed in my biblical clothing , so sandals and sort of a white robe , you know , because again , the outer affects the inner .
I wanted to see how dressing biblically affected my mind .
And this man came up to me and he said , &quot; Why are you dressed like that ? &quot;
And I explained my project , and he said , &quot; Well , I am an adulterer , are you going to stone me ? &quot;
And I said , &quot; Well , that would be great ! &quot;
And I actually took out a handful of stones from my pocket that I had been carrying around for weeks , hoping for just this interaction -- and , you know , they were pebbles -- but he grabbed them out of my hand .
He was actually an elderly man , mid-70s , just so you know .
But he &apos;s still an adulterer , and still quite angry .
He grabbed them out of my hand and threw them at my face , and I felt that I could -- eye for an eye -- I could retaliate , and throw one back at him .
So that was my experience stoning , and it did allow me to talk about , in a more serious way , these big issues .
How can the Bible be so barbaric in some places , and yet so incredibly wise in others ?
How should we view the Bible ?
Should we view it , you know , as original intent , like a sort of a Scalia version of the Bible ?
How was the Bible written ?
And actually , since this is a tech crowd , I talk in the book about how the Bible actually reminds me of the Wikipedia , because it has all of these authors and editors over hundreds of years .
And it &apos;s sort of evolved .
It &apos;s not a book that was written and came down from on high .
So I thought I would end by telling you just a couple of the take-aways , the bigger lessons that I learned from my year .
The first is , thou shalt not take the Bible literally .
This became very , very clear , early on .
Because if you do , then you end up acting like a crazy person , and stoning adulterers , or -- here &apos;s another example .
Well , that &apos;s another . I did spend some time shepherding .
It &apos;s a very relaxing vocation . I recommend it .
But this one is -- the Bible says that you cannot touch women during certain times of the month , and more than that , you cannot sit on a seat where a menstruating woman has sat .
And my wife thought this was very offensive , so she sat in every seat in our apartment , and I had to spend much of the year standing until I bought my own seat and carried it around .
So , you know , I met with creationists .
I went to the creationists &apos; museum .
And these are the ultimate literalists .
And it was fascinating , because they were not stupid people at all .
I would wager that their IQ is exactly the same as the average evolutionist .
It &apos;s just that their faith is so strong in this literal interpretation of the Bible that they distort all the data to fit their model .
And they go through these amazing mental gymnastics to accomplish this .
And I will say , though , the museum is gorgeous .
They really did a fantastic job .
If you &apos;re ever in Kentucky , there &apos;s , you can see a movie of the flood , and they have sprinklers in the ceiling that will sprinkle on you during the flood scenes .
So , whatever you think of creationism -- and I think it &apos;s crazy -- they did a great job .
Another lesson is that thou shalt give thanks .
And this one was a big lesson because I was praying , giving these prayers of thanksgiving , which was odd for an agnostic .
But I was saying thanks all the time , every day , and I started to change my perspective .
And I started to realize the hundreds of little things that go right every day , that I didn &apos;t even notice , that I took for granted , as opposed to focusing on the three or four that went wrong .
So , this is actually a key to happiness for me , is to just remember when I came over here , the car didn &apos;t flip over , and I didn &apos;t trip coming up the stairs .
It &apos;s a remarkable thing .
Third , that thou shall have reverence .
This one was unexpected because I started the year as an agnostic , and by the end of the year , I became what a friend of mine calls a reverent agnostic , which I love .
And I &apos;m trying to start it as a movement .
So , if anyone wants to join , the basic idea is , whether or not there is a God , there &apos;s something important and beautiful about the idea of sacredness , and that our rituals can be sacred .
The Sabbath can be sacred .
This was one of the great things about my year , doing the Sabbath , because I am a workaholic , so having this one day where you cannot work , it really , that changed my life .
So , this idea of sacredness , whether or not there is a God .
Thou shall not stereotype .
This one happened because I spent a lot of time with various religious communities throughout America because I wanted it to be more than about my journey .
I wanted it to be about religion in America .
So , I spent time with evangelical Christians , and Hasidic Jews , and the Amish .
I &apos;m very proud because I think I &apos;m the only person in America to out Bible-talk a Jehovah &apos;s Witness .
After three and a half hours , he looked at his watch , he &apos;s like , &quot; I gotta go . &quot;
Oh , thank you very much .
Thank you . Bless you , bless you .
But it was interesting because I had some very preconceived notions about , for instance , evangelical Christianity , and I found that it &apos;s such a wide and varied movement that it is difficult to make generalizations about it .
There &apos;s a group I met with called the Red Letter Christians , and they focus on the red words in the Bible , which are the ones that Jesus spoke .
That &apos;s how they printed them in the old Bibles .
And their argument is that Jesus never talked about homosexuality .
They have a pamphlet that says , &quot; Here &apos;s what Jesus said about homosexuality , &quot; and you open it up , and there &apos;s nothing in it .
So , they say Jesus did talk a lot about helping the outcasts , helping poor people .
So , this was very inspiring to me .
I recommend Jim Wallis and Tony Campolo .
They &apos;re very inspiring leaders , even though I disagree with much of what they say .
Also , thou shalt not disregard the irrational .
This one was very unexpected because , you know , I grew up with the scientific worldview , and I was shocked learning how much of my life is governed by irrational forces .
And the thing is , if they &apos;re not harmful , they &apos;re not to be completely dismissed .
Because I learned that -- I was thinking , I was doing all these rituals , these biblical rituals , separating my wool and linen , and I would ask these religious people &quot; Why would the Bible possibly tell us to do this ? Why would God care ? &quot;
And they said , &quot; We don &apos;t know , but it &apos;s just rituals that give us meaning . &quot;
And I would say , &quot; But that &apos;s crazy . &quot;
And they would say , &quot; Well , what about you ?
You blow out candles on top of a birthday cake .
If a guy from Mars came down and saw , here &apos;s one guy blowing out the fire on top of a cake versus another guy not wearing clothes of mixed fabrics , would the Martians say , &apos; Well , that guy , he makes sense , but that guy &apos;s crazy ? &apos; &quot; So no , I think that rituals are , by nature , irrational .
So the key is to choose the right rituals , the ones that are not harmful -- but rituals by themselves are not to be dismissed .
And finally I learned that thou shall pick and choose .
And this one I learned because I tried to follow everything in the Bible .
And I failed miserably .
Because you can &apos;t .
You have to pick and choose . And anyone who follows the Bible is going to be picking and choosing .
The key is to pick and choose the right parts .
There &apos;s the phrase called cafeteria religion , and the fundamentalists will use it in a denigrating way , and they &apos;ll say , &quot; Oh , it &apos;s just cafeteria religion .
You &apos;re just picking and choosing . &quot;
But my argument is , &quot; What &apos;s wrong with cafeterias ? &quot;
I &apos;ve had some great meals at cafeterias .
I &apos;ve also had some meals that make me want to dry heave .
So , it &apos;s about choosing the parts of the Bible about compassion , about tolerance , about loving your neighbor , as opposed to the parts about homosexuality is a sin , or intolerance , or violence , which are very much in the Bible as well .
So if we are to find any meaning in this book , then we have to really engage it , and wrestle with it .
And I thought I &apos;d end with just a couple more .
There &apos;s me reading the Bible .
That &apos;s how I hailed taxicabs .
Seriously , and it worked . And yes , that was actually a rented sheep , so I had to return that in the morning , but it served well for a day .
So , anyway , thank you so much for letting me speak .

So , I was in the hospital for a long time .
And a few years after I left , I went back , and the chairman of the burn department was very excited to see me -- said , &quot; Dan , I have a fantastic new treatment for you . &quot;
I was very excited . I walked with him to his office .
And he explained to me that , when I shave , I have little black dots on the left side of my face where the hair is , but on the right side of my face I was badly burned so I have no hair , and this creates lack of symmetry .
And what &apos;s the brilliant idea he had ?
He was going to tattoo little black dots on the right side of my face and make me look very symmetric .
It sounded interesting . He asked me to go and shave .
Let me tell you , this was a strange way to shave , because I thought about it and I realized that the way I was shaving then would be the way I would shave for the rest of my life -- because I had to keep the width the same .
When I got back to his office , I wasn &apos;t really sure .
I said , &quot; Can I see some evidence for this ? &quot;
So he showed me some pictures of little cheeks with little black dots -- not very informative .
I said , &quot; What happens when I grow older and my hair becomes white ?
What would happen then ? &quot;
&quot; Oh , don &apos;t worry about it , &quot; he said .
&quot; We have lasers ; we can whiten it out . &quot;
But I was still concerned , so I said , &quot; You know what , I &apos;m not going to do it . &quot;
And then came one of the biggest guilt trips of my life .
This is coming from a Jewish guy , all right , so that means a lot .
And he said , &quot; Dan , what &apos;s wrong with you ?
Do you enjoy looking non-symmetric ?
Do you have some kind of perverted pleasure from this ?
Do women feel pity for you and have sex with you more frequently ? &quot;
None of those happened .
And this was very surprising to me , because I &apos;ve gone through many treatments -- there were many treatments I decided not to do -- and I never got this guilt trip to this extent .
But I decided not to have this treatment .
And I went to his deputy and asked him , &quot; What was going on ?
Where was this guilt trip coming from ? &quot;
And he explained that they have done this procedure on two patients already , and they need the third patient for a paper they were writing .
Now you probably think that this guy &apos;s a schmuck .
Right , that &apos;s what he seems like .
But let me give you a different perspective on the same story .
A few years ago , I was running some of my own experiments in the lab .
And when we run experiments , we usually hope that one group will behave differently than another .
So we had one group that I hoped their performance would be very high , another group that I thought their performance would be very low , and when I got the results , that &apos;s what we got -- I was very happy -- aside from one person .
There was one person in the group that was supposed to have very high performance that was actually performing terribly .
And he pulled the whole mean down , destroying my statistical significance of the test .
So I looked carefully at this guy .
He was 20-some years older than anybody else in the sample .
And I remembered that the old and drunken guy came one day to the lab wanting to make some easy cash and this was the guy .
&quot; Fantastic ! &quot; I thought . &quot; Let &apos;s throw him out .
Who would ever include a drunken guy in a sample ? &quot;
But a couple of days later , we thought about it with my students , and we said , &quot; What would have happened if this drunken guy was not in that condition ?
What would have happened if he was in the other group ?
Would we have thrown him out then ? &quot;
We probably wouldn &apos;t have looked at the data at all , and if we did look at the data , we &apos;d probably have said , &quot; Fantastic ! What a smart guy who is performing this low , &quot; because he would have pulled the mean of the group lower , giving us even stronger statistical results than we could .
So we decided not to throw the guy out and to rerun the experiment .
But you know , these stories , and lots of other experiments that we &apos;ve done on conflicts of interest , basically kind of bring two points to the foreground for me .
The first one is that in life we encounter many people who , in some way or another , try to tattoo our faces .
They just have the incentives that get them to be blinded to reality and give us advice that is inherently biased .
And I &apos;m sure that it &apos;s something that we all recognize , and we see that it happens .
Maybe we don &apos;t recognize it every time , but we understand that it happens .
The most difficult thing , of course , is to recognize that sometimes we too are blinded by our own incentives .
And that &apos;s a much , much more difficult lesson to take into account .
Because we don &apos;t see how conflicts of interest work on us .
When I was doing these experiments , in my mind , I was helping science .
I was eliminating the data to get the true pattern of the data to shine through .
I wasn &apos;t doing something bad .
In my mind , I was actually a knight trying to help science move along .
But this was not the case .
I was actually interfering with the process with lots of good intentions .
And I think the real challenge is to figure out where are the cases in our lives where conflicts of interest work on us , and try not to trust our own intuition to overcome it , but to try to do things that prevent us from falling prey to these behaviors , because we can create lots of undesirable circumstances .
I do want to leave you with one positive thought .
I mean , this is all very depressing , right -- people have conflicts of interest , we don &apos;t see it , and so on .
The positive perspective , I think , of all of this is that , if we do understand when we go wrong , if we understand the deep mechanisms of why we fail and where we fail , we can actually hope to fix things .
And that , I think , is the hope . Thank you very much .

So for the past year and a half , my team at Push Pop Press and Charlie Melcher and Melcher Media have been working on creating the first feature-length interactive book .
It &apos;s called &quot; Our Choice &quot; and the author is Al Gore .
It &apos;s the sequel to &quot; An Inconvenient Truth , &quot; and it explores all the solutions that will solve the climate crisis .
The book starts like this . This is the cover .
As the globe spins , we can see our location , and we can open the book and swipe through the chapters to browse the book .
Or , we can scroll through the pages at the bottom .
And if we wanted to zoom into a page , we can just open it up .
And anything you see in the book , you can pick up with two fingers and lift off the page and open up .
And if you want to go back and read the book again , you just fold it back up and put it back on the page .
And so this works the same way ; you pick it up and pop it open .
I consider myself among the majority who look at windmills and feel they &apos;re a beautiful addition to the landscape .
Mike Matas : And so throughout the whole book , Al Gore will walk you through and explain the photos .
This photo , you can you can even see on an interactive map .
Zoom into it and see where it was taken .
And throughout the book , there &apos;s over an hour of documentary footage and interactive animations .
So you can open this one .
AG : Most modern wind turbines consist of a large ...
MM : It starts playing immediately .
And while it &apos;s playing , we can pinch and peak back at the page , and the movie keeps playing .
Or we can zoom out to the table of contents , and the video keeps playing .
But one of the coolest things in this book are the interactive infographics .
This one shows the wind potential all around the United States .
But instead of just showing us the information , we can take our finger and explore , and see , state by state , exactly how much wind potential there is .
We can do the same for geothermal energy and solar power .
This is one of my favorites .
So this shows ...
When the wind is blowing , any excess energy coming from the windmill is diverted into the battery .
And as the wind starts dying down , any excess energy will be diverted back into the house -- the lights never go out .
And this whole book , it doesn &apos;t just run on the iPad .
It also runs on the iPhone .
And so you can start reading on your iPad in your living room and then pick up where you left off on the iPhone .
And it works the exact same way .
You can pinch into any page .
Open it up .
So that &apos;s Push Pop Press &apos; first title , Al Gore &apos;s &quot; Our Choice . &quot;
Thank you .
That &apos;s spectacular .
Do you want to be a publisher , a technology licenser ?
What is the business here ?
Is this something that other people can do ?
MM : Yeah , we &apos;re building a tool that makes it really easy for publishers right now to build this content .
So Melcher Media &apos;s team , who &apos;s on the East coast -- and we &apos;re on the West coast , building the software -- takes our tool and , every day , drags in images and text .
So you want to license this software to publishers to make books as beautiful as that ?
All right . Mike , thanks so much .
MM : Thank you .

So what &apos;s a good definition for cyborg ?
Well , traditional definition is &quot; an organism to which exogenous components have been added for the purpose of adapting to new environments . &quot;
That came from a 1960 paper on space travel , because , if you think about it , space is pretty awkward .
People aren &apos;t supposed to be there .
But humans are curious , and they like to add things to their bodies so they can go to the Alps one day and then become a fish in the sea the next .
So let &apos;s look at the concept of traditional anthropology .
Somebody goes to another country , says , &quot; How fascinating these people are , how interesting their tools are , how curious their culture is . &quot;
And then they write a paper , and maybe a few other anthropologists read it , and we think it &apos;s very exotic .
Well , what &apos;s happening is that we &apos;ve suddenly found a new species .
I , as a cyborg anthropologist , have suddenly said , &quot; Oh , wow . Now suddenly we &apos;re a new form of Homo sapiens , and look at these fascinating cultures , and look at these curious rituals that everybody &apos;s doing around this technology .
They &apos;re clicking on things and staring at screens . &quot;
Now there &apos;s a reason why I study this , versus traditional anthropology .
And the reason is that tool use , in the beginning -- for thousands and thousands of years , everything has been a physical modification of self .
It has helped us to extend our physical selves , go faster , hit things harder , and there &apos;s been a limit on that .
But now what we &apos;re looking at is not an extension of the physical self , but an extension of the mental self , and because of that , we &apos;re able to travel faster , communicate differently .
And the other thing that happens is that we &apos;re all carrying around little Mary Poppins technology .
We can put anything we want into it , and it doesn &apos;t get heavier , and then we can take anything out .
What does the inside of your computer actually look like ?
Well , if you print it out , it looks like a thousand pounds of material that you &apos;re carrying around all the time .
And if you actually lose that information , it means that you suddenly have this loss in your mind , that you suddenly feel like something &apos;s missing , except you aren &apos;t able to see it , so it feels like a very strange emotion .
The other thing that happens is that you have a second self .
Whether you like it or not , you &apos;re starting to show up online , and people are interacting with your second self when you &apos;re not there .
And so you have to be careful about leaving your front lawn open , which is basically your Facebook wall , so that people don &apos;t write on it in the middle of the night -- because it &apos;s very much the equivalent .
And suddenly we have to start to maintain our second self .
You have to present yourself in digital life in a similar way that you would in your analog life .
So , in the same way that you wake up , take a shower and get dressed , you have to learn to do that for your digital self .
And the problem is that a lot of people now , especially adolescents , have to go through two adolescences .
They have to go through their primary one , that &apos;s already awkward , and then they go through their second self &apos;s adolescence , and that &apos;s even more awkward because there &apos;s an actual history of what they &apos;ve gone through online .
And anybody coming in new to technology is an adolescent online right now , and so it &apos;s very awkward , and it &apos;s very difficult for them to do those things .
So when I was little , my dad would sit me down at night and he would say , &quot; I &apos;m going to teach you about time and space in the future . &quot;
And I said , &quot; Great . &quot;
And he said one day , &quot; What &apos;s the shortest distance between two points ? &quot;
And I said , &quot; Well , that &apos;s a straight line . You told me that yesterday . &quot;
I thought I was very clever .
He said , &quot; No , no , no . Here &apos;s a better way . &quot;
He took a piece of paper , drew A and B on one side and the other and folded them together so where A and B touched .
And he said , &quot; That is the shortest distance between two points . &quot;
And I said , &quot; Dad , dad , dad , how do you do that ? &quot;
He said , &quot; Well , you just bend time and space , it takes an awful lot of energy , and that &apos;s just how you do it . &quot;
And I said , &quot; I want to do that . &quot;
And he said , &quot; Well , okay . &quot;
And so , when I went to sleep for the next 10 or 20 years , I was thinking at night , &quot; I want to be the first person to create a wormhole , to make things accelerate faster .
And I want to make a time machine . &quot;
I was always sending messages to my future self using tape recorders .
But then what I realized when I went to college is that technology doesn &apos;t just get adopted because it works .
It gets adopted because people use it and it &apos;s made for humans .
So I started studying anthropology .
And when I was writing my thesis on cell phones , I realized that everyone was carrying around wormholes in their pockets .
They weren &apos;t physically transporting themselves ; they were mentally transporting themselves .
They would click on a button , and they would be connected as A to B immediately .
And I thought , &quot; Oh , wow . I found it . This is great . &quot;
So over time , time and space have compressed because of this .
You can stand on one side of the world , whisper something and be heard on the other .
One of the other ideas that comes around is that you have a different type of time on every single device that you use .
Every single browser tab gives you a different type of time .
And because of that , you start to dig around for your external memories -- where did you leave them ?
So now we &apos;re all these paleontologists that are digging for things that we &apos;ve lost on our external brains that we &apos;re carrying around in our pockets .
And that incites a sort of panic architecture -- &quot; Oh no , where &apos;s this thing ? &quot;
We &apos;re all &quot; I Love Lucy &quot; on a great assembly line of information , and we can &apos;t keep up .
And so what happens is , when we bring all that into the social space , we end up checking our phones all the time .
So we have this thing called ambient intimacy .
It &apos;s not that we &apos;re always connected to everybody , but at anytime we can connect to anyone we want .
And if you were able to print out everybody in your cell phone , the room would be very crowded .
These are the people that you have access to right now , in general -- all of these people , all of your friends and family that you can connect to .
And so there are some psychological effects that happen with this .
One I &apos;m really worried about is that people aren &apos;t taking time for mental reflection anymore , and that they aren &apos;t slowing down and stopping , being around all those people in the room all the time that are trying to compete for their attention on the simultaneous time interfaces , paleontology and panic architecture .
They &apos;re not just sitting there .
And really , when you have no external input , that is a time when there is a creation of self , when you can do long-term planning , when you can try and figure out who you really are .
And then , once you do that , you can figure out how to present your second self in a legitimate way , instead of just dealing with everything as it comes in -- and oh , I have to do this , and I have to do this , and I have to do this .
And so this is very important .
I &apos;m really worried that , especially kids today , they &apos;re not going to be dealing with this down-time , that they have an instantaneous button-clicking culture , and that everything comes to them , and that they become very excited about it and very addicted to it .
So if you think about it , the world hasn &apos;t stopped either .
It has its own external prosthetic devices , and these devices are helping us all to communicate and interact with each other .
But when you actually visualize it , all the connections that we &apos;re doing right now -- this is an image of the mapping of the Internet -- it doesn &apos;t look technological .
It actually looks very organic .
This is the first time in the entire history of humanity that we &apos;ve connected in this way .
And it &apos;s not that machines are taking over .
It &apos;s that they &apos;re helping us to be more human , helping us to connect with each other .
The most successful technology gets out of the way and helps us live our lives .
And really , it ends up being more human than technology , because we &apos;re co-creating each other all the time .
And so this is the important point that I like to study : that things are beautiful , that it &apos;s still a human connection -- it &apos;s just done in a different way .
We &apos;re just increasing our humanness and our ability to connect with each other , regardless of geography .
So that &apos;s why I study cyborg anthropology .
Thank you .

I &apos;m a garbage man .
And you might find it interesting that I became a garbage man , because I absolutely hate waste .
I hope , within the next 10 minutes , to change the way you think about a lot of the stuff in your life .
And I &apos;d like to start at the very beginning .
Think back when you were just a kid .
How did look at the stuff in your life ?
Perhaps it was like these toddler rules : It &apos;s my stuff if I saw it first .
The entire pile is my stuff if I &apos;m building something .
The more stuff that &apos;s mine , the better .
And of course , it &apos;s your stuff if it &apos;s broken .
Well after spending about 20 years in the recycling industry , it &apos;s become pretty clear to me that we don &apos;t necessarily leave these toddler rules behind as we develop into adults .
And let me tell you why I have that perspective .
Because each and every day at our recycling plants around the world we handle about one million pounds of people &apos;s discarded stuff .
Now a million pounds a day sounds like a lot of stuff , but it &apos;s a tiny drop of the durable goods that are disposed each and every year around the world -- well less than one percent .
In fact , the United Nations estimates that there &apos;s about 85 billion pounds a year of electronics waste that gets discarded around the world each and every year -- and that &apos;s one of the most rapidly growing parts of our waste stream .
And if you throw in other durable goods like automobiles and so forth , that number well more than doubles .
And of course , the more developed the country , the bigger these mountains .
Now when you see these mountains , most people think of garbage .
We see above-ground mines .
And the reason we see mines is because there &apos;s a lot of valuable raw materials that went into making all of this stuff in the first place .
And it &apos;s becoming increasingly important that we figure out how to extract these raw materials from these extremely complicated waste streams .
Because as we &apos;ve heard all week at TED , the world &apos;s getting to be a smaller place with more people in it who want more and more stuff .
And of course , they want the toys and the tools that many of us take for granted .
And what goes into making those toys and tools that we use every single day ?
It &apos;s mostly many types of plastics and many types of metals .
And the metals , we typically get from ore that we mine in ever widening mines and ever deepening mines around the world .
And the plastics , we get from oil , which we go to more remote locations and drill ever deeper wells to extract .
And these practices have significant economic and environmental implications that we &apos;re already starting to see today .
The good news is we are starting to recover materials from our end-of-life stuff and starting to recycle our end-of-life stuff , particularly in regions of the world like here in Europe that have recycling policies in place that require that this stuff be recycled in a responsible manner .
Most of what &apos;s extracted from our end-of-life stuff , if it makes it to a recycler , are the metals .
To put that in perspective -- and I &apos;m using steel as a proxy here for metals , because it &apos;s the most common metal -- if your stuff makes it to a recycler , probably over 90 percent of the metals are going to be recovered and reused for another purpose .
Plastics are a whole other story : well less than 10 percent are recovered .
In fact , it &apos;s more like five percent .
Most of it &apos;s incinerated or landfilled .
Now most people think that &apos;s because plastics are a throw-away material , have very little value .
But actually , plastics are several times more valuable than steel .
And there &apos;s more plastics produced and consumed around the world on a volume basis every year than steel .
So why is such a plentiful and valuable material not recovered at anywhere near the rate of the less valuable material ?
Well it &apos;s predominantly because metals are very easy to recycle from other materials and from one another .
They have very different densities .
They have different electrical and magnetic properties .
And they even have different colors .
So it &apos;s very easy for either humans or machines to separate these metals from one another and from other materials .
Plastics have overlapping densities over a very narrow range .
They have either identical or very similar electrical and magnetic properties .
And any plastic can be any color , as you probably well know .
So the traditional ways of separating materials just simply don &apos;t work for plastics .
Another consequence of metals being so easy to recycle by humans is that a lot of our stuff from the developed world -- and sadly to say , particularly from the United States , where we don &apos;t have any recycling policies in place like here in Europe -- finds its way to developing countries for low-cost recycling .
People , for as little as a dollar a day , pick through our stuff .
They extract what they can , which is mostly the metals -- circuit boards and so forth -- and they leave behind mostly what they can &apos;t recover , which is , again , mostly the plastics .
Or they burn the plastics to get to the metals in burn houses like you see here .
And they extract the metals by hand .
Now while this may be the low-economic-cost solution , this is certainly not the low-environmental or human health-and-safety solution .
I call this environmental arbitrage .
And it &apos;s not fair , it &apos;s not safe and it &apos;s not sustainable .
Now because the plastics are so plentiful -- and by the way , those other methods don &apos;t lead to the recovery of plastics , obviously -- but people do try to recover the plastics .
This is just one example .
This is a photo I took standing on the rooftops of one of the largest slums in the world in Mumbai , India .
They store the plastics on the roofs .
They bring them below those roofs into small workshops like these , and people try very hard to separate the plastics , by color , by shape , by feel , by any technique they can .
And sometimes they &apos;ll resort to what &apos;s known as the &quot; burn and sniff &quot; technique where they &apos;ll burn the plastic and smell the fumes to try to determine the type of plastic .
None of these techniques result in any amount of recycling in any significant way .
And by the way , please don &apos;t try this technique at home .
So what are we to do about this space-age material , at least what we used to call a space-aged material , these plastics ?
Well I certainly believe that it &apos;s far too valuable and far too abundant to keep putting back in the ground or certainly send up in smoke .
So about 20 years ago , I literally started in my garage tinkering around , trying to figure out how to separate these very similar materials from each other , and eventually enlisted a lot of my friends , in the mining world actually , and in the plastics world , and we started going around to mining laboratories around the world .
Because after all , we &apos;re doing above-ground mining .
And we eventually broke the code .
This is the last frontier of recycling .
It &apos;s the last major material to be recovered in any significant amount on the Earth .
And we finally figured out how to do it .
And in the process , we started recreating how the plastics industry makes plastics .
The traditional way to make plastics is with oil or petrochemicals .
You breakdown the molecules , you recombine them in very specific ways , to make all the wonderful plastics that we enjoy each and every day .
We said , there &apos;s got to be a more sustainable way to make plastics .
And not just sustainable from an environmental standpoint , sustainable from an economic standpoint as well .
Well a good place to start is with waste .
It certainly doesn &apos;t cost as much as oil , and it &apos;s plentiful , as I hope that you &apos;ve been able to see from the photographs .
And because we &apos;re not breaking down the plastic into molecules and recombining them , we &apos;re using a mining approach to extract the materials .
We have significantly lower capital costs in our plant equipment .
We have enormous energy savings .
I don &apos;t know how many other projects on the planet right now can save 80 to 90 percent of the energy compared to making something the traditional way .
And instead of plopping down several hundred million dollars to build a chemical plant that will only make one type of plastic for its entire life , our plants can make any type of plastic we feed them .
And we make a drop-in replacement for that plastic that &apos;s made from petrochemicals .
Our customers get to enjoy huge CO2 savings .
They get to close the loop with their products .
And they get to make more sustainable products .
In the short time period I have , I want to show you a little bit of a sense about how we do this .
It starts with metal recyclers who shred our stuff into very small bits .
They recover the metals and leave behind what &apos;s called shredder residue -- it &apos;s their waste -- a very complex mixture of materials , but predominantly plastics .
We take out the things that aren &apos;t plastics , such as the metals they missed , carpeting , foam , rubber , wood , glass , paper , you name it .
Even an occasional dead animal , unfortunately .
And it goes in the first part of our process here , which is more like traditional recycling .
We &apos;re sieving the material , we &apos;re using magnets , we &apos;re using air classification .
It looks like the Willy Wonka factory at this point .
At the end of this process , we have a mixed plastic composite : many different types of plastics and many different grades of plastics .
This goes into the more sophisticated part of our process , and the really hard work , multi-step separation process begins .
We grind the plastic down to about the size of your small fingernail .
We use a very highly automated process to sort those plastics , not only by type , but by grade .
And out the end of that part of the process come little flakes of plastic : one type , one grade .
We then use optical sorting to color sort this material .
We blend it in 50,000-lb. blending silos .
We push that material to extruders where we melt it , push it through small die holes , make spaghetti-like plastic strands .
And we chop those strands into what are called pellets .
And this becomes the currency of the plastics industry .
This is the same material that you would get from oil .
And today , we &apos;re producing it from your old stuff , and it &apos;s going right back into your new stuff .
So now , instead of your stuff ending up on a hillside in a developing country or literally going up in smoke , you can find your old stuff back on top of your desk in new products , in your office , or back at work in your home .
And these are just a few examples of companies that are buying our plastic , replacing virgin plastic , to make their new products .
So I hope I &apos;ve changed the way you look at at least some of the stuff in your life .
We took our clues from mother nature .
Mother nature wastes very little , reuses practically everything .
And I hope that you stop looking at yourself as a consumer -- that &apos;s a label I &apos;ve always hated my entire life -- and think of yourself as just using resources in one form , until they can be transformed to another form for another use later in time .
And finally , I hope you agree with me to change that last toddler rule just a little bit to : &quot; If it &apos;s broken , it &apos;s my stuff . &quot;
Thank you for your time .

&lt; title &gt; Mike Biddle : We can recycle plastic &lt; / title &gt;
&lt; description &gt; Less than 10 % of plastic trash is recycled -- compared to almost 90 % of metals -- because of the massively complicated problem of finding and sorting the different kinds . Frustrated by this waste , Mike Biddle has developed a cheap and incredibly energy efficient plant that can , and does , recycle any kind of plastic . &amp; lt ; a href = &quot; http : / / blog.ted.com / 2012 / 10 / 22 / a-better-way-to-recycle-plastics-mike-biddle-replies-to-questions-and-comments-about-his-2011-tedtalk &quot; &amp; gt ; Read Mike &apos;s responses to questions about this talk . &amp; lt ; / a &amp; gt ; &lt; / description &gt;

Everyone , please think of your biggest personal goal .
For real -- you can take a second . You &apos;ve got to feel this to learn it .
Take a few seconds and think of your personal biggest goal , okay ?
Imagine deciding right now that you &apos;re going to do it .
Imagine telling someone that you meet today what you &apos;re going to do .
Imagine their congratulations and their high image of you .
Doesn &apos;t it feel good to say it out loud ?
Don &apos;t you feel one step closer already , like it &apos;s already becoming part of your identity ?
Well , bad news : you should have kept your mouth shut , because that good feeling now will make you less likely to do it .
Repeated psychology tests have proven that telling someone your goal makes it less likely to happen .
Any time you have a goal , there are some steps that need to be done , some work that needs to be done in order to achieve it .
Ideally , you would not be satisfied until you had actually done the work .
But when you tell someone your goal and they acknowledge it , psychologists have found that it &apos;s called a &quot; social reality . &quot;
The mind is kind of tricked into feeling that it &apos;s already done .
And then , because you felt that satisfaction , you &apos;re less motivated to do the actual hard work necessary .
So this goes against the conventional wisdom that we should tell our friends our goals , right -- so they hold us to it .
So , let &apos;s look at the proof .
1926 , Kurt Lewin , founder of social psychology , called this &quot; substitution . &quot;
1933 , Vera Mahler found , when it was acknowledged by others , it felt real in the mind .
1982 , Peter Gollwitzer wrote a whole book about this and in 2009 , he did some new tests that were published .
It goes like this : 163 people across four separate tests -- everyone wrote down their personal goal .
Then half of them announced their commitment to this goal to the room , and half didn &apos;t .
Then everyone was given 45 minutes of work that would directly lead them towards their goal , but they were told that they could stop at any time .
Now , those who kept their mouths shut worked the entire 45 minutes , on average , and when asked afterwards , said that they felt that they had a long way to go still to achieve their goal .
But those who had announced it quit after only 33 minutes , on average , and when asked afterwards , said that they felt much closer to achieving their goal .
So , if this is true , what can we do ?
Well , you could resist the temptation to announce your goal .
You can delay the gratification that the social acknowledgement brings , and you can understand that your mind mistakes the talking for the doing .
But if you do need to talk about something , you can state it in a way that gives you no satisfaction , such as , &quot; I really want to run this marathon , so I need to train five times a week and kick my ass if I don &apos;t , okay ? &quot;
So audience , next time you &apos;re tempted to tell someone your goal , what will you say ?
Exactly , well done .

I &apos;m just going to play a brief video clip .
On the fifth of December 1985 , a bottle of 1787 Lafitte was sold for 105,000 pounds -- nine times the previous world record .
The buyer was Kip Forbes , son of one of the most flamboyant millionaires of the 20th century .
The original owner of the bottle turned out to be one of the most enthusiastic wine buffs of the 18th century .
Château Lafitte is one of the greatest wines in the world , the prince of any wine cellar .
Benjamin Wallace : Now , that &apos;s about all the videotape that remains of an event that set off the longest-running mystery in the modern wine world .
And the mystery existed because of a gentleman named Hardy Rodenstock .
In 1985 , he announced to his friends in the wine world that he had made this incredible discovery .
Some workmen in Paris had broken through a brick wall , and happened upon this hidden cache of wines -- apparently the property of Thomas Jefferson . 1787 , 1784 .
He wouldn &apos;t reveal the exact number of bottles , he would not reveal exactly where the building was and he would not reveal exactly who owned the building .
The mystery persisted for about 20 years .
It finally began to get resolved in 2005 because of this guy .
Bill Koch is a Florida billionaire who owns four of the Jefferson bottles , and he became suspicious .
And he ended up spending over a million dollars and hiring ex-FBI and ex-Scotland Yard agents to try to get to the bottom of this .
There &apos;s now ample evidence that Hardy Rodenstock is a con man , and that the Jefferson bottles were fakes .
But for those 20 years , an unbelievable number of really eminent and accomplished figures in the wine world were sort of drawn into the orbit of these bottles .
I think they wanted to believe that the most expensive bottle of wine in the world must be the best bottle of wine in the world , must be the rarest bottle of wine in the world .
I became increasingly , kind of voyeuristically interested in the question of you know , why do people spend these crazy amounts of money , not only on wine but on lots of things , and are they living a better life than me ?
So , I decided to embark on a quest .
With the generous backing of a magazine I write for sometimes , I decided to sample the very best , or most expensive , or most coveted item in about a dozen categories , which was a very grueling quest , as you can imagine .
This was the first one .
A lot of the Kobe beef that you see in the U.S. is not the real thing .
It may come from Wagyu cattle , but it &apos;s not from the original , Appalachian Hyogo Prefecture in Japan .
There are very few places in the U.S. where you can try real Kobe , and one of them is Wolfgang Puck &apos;s restaurant , Cut , in Los Angeles .
I went there , and I ordered the eight-ounce rib eye for 160 dollars .
And it arrived , and it was tiny .
And I was outraged .
It was like , 160 dollars for this ?
And then I took a bite , and I wished that it was tinier , because Kobe beef is so rich .
It &apos;s like foie gras -- it &apos;s not even like steak .
I almost couldn &apos;t finish it .
I was really happy when I was done .
Now , the photographer who took the pictures for this project for some reason posed his dog in a lot of them , so that &apos;s why you &apos;re going to see this recurring character .
Which , I guess , you know , communicates to you that I did not think that one was really worth the price .
White truffles .
One of the most expensive luxury foods by weight in the world .
To try this , I went to a Mario Batali restaurant in Manhattan -- Del Posto .
The waiter , you know , came out with the white truffle knob and his shaver , and he shaved it onto my pasta and he said , you know , &quot; Would Signore like the truffles ? &quot;
And the charm of white truffles is in their aroma .
It &apos;s not in their taste , really . It &apos;s not in their texture .
It &apos;s in the smell .
These white pearlescent flakes hit the noodles , this haunting , wonderful , nutty , mushroomy smell wafted up .
10 seconds passed and it was gone .
And then I was left with these little ugly flakes on my pasta that , you know , their purpose had been served , and so I &apos;m afraid to say that this was also a disappointment to me .
There were several -- several of these items were disappointments .
Yeah .
The magazine wouldn &apos;t pay for me to go there .
They did give me a tour , though .
And this hotel suite is 4,300 square feet .
It has 360-degree views .
It has four balconies .
It was designed by the architect I.M. Pei .
It comes with its own Rolls Royce and driver .
It comes with its own wine cellar that you can draw freely from .
When I took the tour , it actually included some Opus One , I was glad to see .
30,000 dollars for a night in a hotel .
This is soap that &apos;s made from silver nanoparticles , which have antibacterial properties .
I washed my face with this this morning in preparation for this .
And it , you know , tickled a little bit and it smelled good , but I have to say that nobody here has complimented me on the cleanliness of my face today .
But then again , nobody has complimented me on the jeans I &apos;m wearing .
These ones GQ did spring for -- I own these -- but I will tell you , not only did I not get a compliment from any of you , I have not gotten a compliment from anybody in the months that I have owned and worn these .
I don &apos;t think that whether or not you &apos;re getting a compliment should be the test of something &apos;s value , but I think in the case of a fashion item , an article of clothing , that &apos;s a reasonable benchmark .
That said , a lot of work goes into these .
They are made from handpicked organic Zimbabwean cotton that has been shuttle loomed and then hand-dipped in natural indigo 24 times .
But no compliments .
Thank you .

He uses tiny bottles , the glass is tinted , he tops the olive oil off with an inert gas .
And he actually -- once he releases a batch of it , he regularly conducts molecular analyses and posts the results online , so you can go online and look at your batch number and see how the phenolics are developing , and , you know , gauge its freshness .
I did a blind taste test of this with 20 people and five other olive oils .
It tasted fine . It tasted interesting .
It was very green , it was very peppery .
But in the blind taste test , it came in last .
The olive oil that came in first was actually a bottle of Whole Foods 365 olive oil which had been oxidizing next to my stove for six months .
A recurring theme is that a lot of these things are from Japan -- you &apos;ll start to notice .
I don &apos;t play golf , so I couldn &apos;t actually road test these , but I did interview a guy who owns them .
Even the people who market these clubs -- I mean , they &apos;ll say these have four axis shafts which minimize loss of club speed and thereby drive the ball farther -- but they &apos;ll say , look , you know , you &apos;re not getting 57,000 dollars worth of performance from these clubs .
You &apos;re paying for the bling , that they &apos;re encrusted with gold and platinum .
The guy who I interviewed who owns them did say that he &apos;s gotten a lot of pleasure out of them , so ...
Oh , yeah , you know this one ?
This is a coffee made from a very unusual process .
The luwak is an Asian Palm Civet .
It &apos;s a cat that lives in trees , and at night it comes down and it prowls the coffee plantations .
And apparently it &apos;s a very picky eater and it , you know , hones in on only the ripest coffee cherries .
And then an enzyme in its digestive tract leeches into the beans , and people with the unenviable job of collecting these cats &apos; leavings then go through the forest collecting the , you know , results and processing it into coffee -- although you actually can buy it in the unprocessed form .
That &apos;s right .
Unrelatedly -- Japan is doing crazy things with toilets .
There is now a toilet that has an MP3 player in it .
There &apos;s one with a fragrance dispenser .
There &apos;s one that actually analyzes the contents of the bowl and transmits the results via email to your doctor .
It &apos;s almost like a home medical center -- and that is the direction that Japanese toilet technology is heading in .
This one does not have those bells and whistles , but for pure functionality it &apos;s pretty much the best -- the Neorest 600 .
And to try this -- I couldn &apos;t get a loaner , but I did go into the Manhattan showroom of the manufacturer , Toto , and they have a bathroom off of the showroom that you can use , which I used .
It &apos;s fully automated -- you walk towards it , and the seat lifts .
The seat is preheated .
There &apos;s a water jet that cleans you .
There &apos;s an air jet that dries you .
You get up , it flushes by itself .
The lid closes , it self-cleans .
Not only is it a technological leap forward , but I really do believe it &apos;s a bit of a cultural leap forward .
I mean , a no hands , no toilet paper toilet .
And I want to get one of these .
This was another one I could not get a loaner of .
Tom Cruise supposedly owns this bed .
There &apos;s a little plaque on the end that , you know , each buyer gets their name engraved on it .
To try this one , the maker of it let me and my wife spend the night in the Manhattan showroom .
Lights glaring in off the street , and we had to hire a security guard and all these things .
But anyway , we had a great night &apos;s sleep .
And you spend a third of your life in bed .
I don &apos;t think it &apos;s that bad of a deal .
This was a fun one .
This is the fastest street-legal car in the world and the most expensive production car .
I got to drive this with a chaperone from the company , a professional race car driver , and we drove around the canyons outside of Los Angeles and down on the Pacific Coast Highway .
And , you know , when we pulled up to a stoplight the people in the adjacent cars kind of gave us respectful nods .
And it was really amazing .
It was such a smooth ride .
Most of the cars that I drive , if I get up to 80 they start to rattle .
I switched lanes on the highway and the driver , this chaperone , said , &quot; You know , you were just going 110 miles an hour . &quot;
And I had no idea that I was one of those obnoxious people you occasionally see weaving in and out of traffic , because it was just that smooth .
And if I was a billionaire , I would get one .
This is a completely gratuitous video I &apos;m just going to show of one of the pitfalls of advanced technology .
This is Tom Cruise arriving at the &quot; Mission : Impossible III &quot; premiere .
When he tries to open the door , you could call it &quot; Mission : Impossible IV . &quot;
There was one object that I could not get my hands on , and that was the 1947 Cheval Blanc .
The &apos; 47 Cheval Blanc is probably the most mythologized wine of the 20th century .
And Cheval Blanc is kind of an unusual wine for Bordeaux in having a significant percentage of the Cabernet Franc grape .
And 1947 was a legendary vintage , especially in the right bank of Bordeaux .
And just together , that vintage and that chateau took on this aura that eventually kind of gave it this cultish following .
But it &apos;s 60 years old .
There &apos;s not much of it left .
What there is of it left you don &apos;t know if it &apos;s real -- it &apos;s considered to be the most faked wine in the world .
Not that many people are looking to pop open their one remaining bottle for a journalist .
So , I &apos;d about given up trying to get my hands on one of these .
I &apos;d put out feelers to retailers , to auctioneers , and it was coming up empty .
And then I got an email from a guy named Bipin Desai .
Bipin Desai is a U.C. Riverside theoretical physicist who also happens to be the preeminent organizer of rare wine tastings , and he said , &quot; I &apos;ve got a tasting coming up where we &apos;re going to serve the &apos; 47 Cheval Blanc . &quot;
And it was going to be a double vertical -- it was going to be 30 vintages of Cheval Blanc , and 30 vintages of Yquem .
And it was an invitation you do not refuse .
I went .
It was three days , four meals .
And at lunch on Saturday , we opened the &apos; 47 .
And you know , it had this fragrant softness , and it smelled a little bit of linseed oil .
And then I tasted it , and it , you know , had this kind of unctuous , porty richness , which is characteristic of that wine -- that it sort of resembles port in a lot of ways .
There were people at my table who thought it was , you know , fantastic .
There were some people who were a little less impressed .
And I wasn &apos;t that impressed .
And I don &apos;t -- call my palate a philistine palate -- so it doesn &apos;t necessarily mean something that I wasn &apos;t impressed , but I was not the only one there who had that reaction .
And it wasn &apos;t just to that wine .
Any one of the wines served at this tasting , if I &apos;d been served it at a dinner party , it would have been , you know , the wine experience of my lifetime , and incredibly memorable .
But drinking 60 great wines over three days , they all just blurred together , and it became almost a grueling experience .
And I just wanted to finish by mentioning a very interesting study which came out earlier this year from some researchers at Stanford and Caltech .
And they gave subjects the same wine , labeled with different price tags .
A lot of people , you know , said that they liked the more expensive wine more -- it was the same wine , but they thought it was a different one that was more expensive .
But what was unexpected was that these researchers did MRI brain imaging while the people were drinking the wine , and not only did they say they enjoyed the more expensively labeled wine more -- their brain actually registered as experiencing more pleasure from the same wine when it was labeled with a higher price tag .
Thank you .

&lt; description &gt; Can happiness be bought ?

&lt; url &gt; http : / / www.ted.com / talks / stefan _ sagmeister _ on _ what _ he _ has _ learned.html &lt; / url &gt;
I was here about four years ago , talking about the relationship of design and happiness .
At the very end of it , I showed a list under that title .
I learned very few things in addition since -- but made a whole number of them into projects since .
These are inflatable monkeys in every city in Scotland : &quot; Everybody always thinks they are right . &quot;
They were combined in the media .
&quot; Drugs are fun in the beginning but become a drag later on . &quot;
We &apos;re doing changing media .
This is a projection that can see the viewer as the viewer walks by .
You can &apos;t help but actually ripping that spider web apart .
All of these things are pieces of graphic design .
We do them for our clients .
They are commissioned .
I would never have the money to actually pay for the installment or pay for all the billboards or the production of these , so there &apos;s always a client attached to them .
These are 65,000 coat hangers in a street that &apos;s lined with fashion stores .
&quot; Worrying solves nothing . &quot;
&quot; Money does not make me happy &quot; appeared first as double-page spreads in a magazine .
The printer lost the file , didn &apos;t tell us .
When the magazine -- actually , when I got the subscription -- it was 12 following pages .
It said , &quot; Money does does make me happy . &quot;
And a friend of mine in Austria felt so sorry for me that he talked the largest casino owner in Linz into letting us wrap his building .
So this is the big pedestrian zone in Linz .
It just says &quot; Money , &quot; and if you look down the side street , it says , &quot; does not make me happy . &quot;
We had a show that just came down last week in New York .
We steamed up the windows permanently , and every hour we had a different designer come in and write these things that they &apos;ve learned into the steam in the window .
Everybody participated -- Milton Glaser , Massimo Vignelli .
Singapore was quite in discussion .
This is a little spot that we filmed there that &apos;s to be displayed on the large JumboTrons in Singapore .
And , of course , it &apos;s one that &apos;s dear to my heart , because all of these sentiments -- some banal , some a bit more profound -- all originally had come out of my diary .
And I do go often into the diary and check if I wanted to change something about the situation .
If it &apos;s -- see it for a long enough time , I actually do something about it .
And the very last one is a billboard .
This is our roof in New York , the roof of the studio .
This is newsprint plus stencils that lie on the newsprint .
We let that lie around in the sun .
As you all know , newsprint yellows significantly in the sun .
After a week , we took the stencils and the leaves off , shipped the newsprints to Lisbon to a very sunny spot , so on day one the billboard said , &quot; Complaining is silly . Either act or forget . &quot;
Three days later it faded , and a week later , no more complaining anywhere .
Thank you so much .

Hi . I &apos;m here to talk to you about the importance of praise , admiration and thank you , and having it be specific and genuine .
And the way I got interested in this was , I noticed in myself , when I was growing up , and until about a few years ago , that I would want to say thank you to someone , I would want to praise them , I would want to take in their praise of me and I &apos;d just stop it .
And I asked myself , why ?
I felt shy , I felt embarrassed .
And then my question became , am I the only one who does this ?
So , I decided to investigate .
I &apos;m fortunate enough to work in the rehab facility , so I get to see people who are facing life and death with addiction .
And sometimes it comes down to something as simple as , their core wound is their father died without ever saying he &apos;s proud of them .
But then , they hear from all the family and friends that the father told everybody else that he was proud of him , but he never told the son .
It &apos;s because he didn &apos;t know that his son needed to hear it .
So my question is , why don &apos;t we ask for the things that we need ?
I know a gentleman , married for 25 years , who &apos;s longing to hear his wife say , &quot; Thank you for being the breadwinner , so I can stay home with the kids , &quot; but won &apos;t ask .
I know a woman who &apos;s good at this .
She , once a week , meets with her husband and says , &quot; I &apos;d really like you to thank me for all these things I did in the house and with the kids . &quot;
And he goes , &quot; Oh , this is great , this is great . &quot;
And praise really does have to be genuine , but she takes responsibility for that .
And a friend of mine , April , who I &apos;ve had since kindergarten , she thanks her children for doing their chores .
And she said , &quot; Why wouldn &apos;t I thank it , even though they &apos;re supposed to do it ? &quot;
So , the question is , why was I blocking it ?
Why were other people blocking it ?
Why can I say , &quot; I &apos;ll take my steak medium rare , I need size six shoes , &quot; but I won &apos;t say , &quot; Would you praise me this way ? &quot;
And it &apos;s because I &apos;m giving you critical data about me .
I &apos;m telling you where I &apos;m insecure .
I &apos;m telling you where I need your help .
And I &apos;m treating you , my inner circle , like you &apos;re the enemy .
Because what can you do with that data ?
You could neglect me .
You could abuse it .
Or you could actually meet my need .
And I took my bike into the bike store-- I love this -- same bike , and they &apos;d do something called &quot; truing &quot; the wheels .
The guy said , &quot; You know , when you true the wheels , it &apos;s going to make the bike so much better . &quot;
I get the same bike back , I &apos;ve had for two and a half years , and my bike is like new .
So , I &apos;m going to challenge all of you .
I want you to true your wheels : be honest about the praise that you need to hear .
What do you need to hear ? Go home to your wife -- go ask her , what does she need ?
Go home to your husband -- what does he need ?
Go home and ask those questions , and then help the people around you .
And it &apos;s simple .
And why should we care about this ?
We talk about world peace .
How can we have world peace with different cultures , different languages ?
I think it starts household by household , under the same roof .
So , let &apos;s make it right in our own backyard .
And I want to thank all of you in the audience for being great husbands , great mothers , friends , daughters , sons .
And maybe somebody &apos;s never said that to you , but you &apos;ve done a really , really good job .
And thank you for being here , just showing up and changing the world with your ideas .
Thank you .

So , imagine you &apos;re standing on a street anywhere in America and a Japanese man comes up to you and says , &quot; Excuse me , what is the name of this block ? &quot;
And you say , &quot; I &apos;m sorry , well , this is Oak Street , that &apos;s Elm Street .
This is 26th , that &apos;s 27th . &quot;
He says , &quot; OK , but what is the name of that block ? &quot;
You say , &quot; Well , blocks don &apos;t have names .
Streets have names ; blocks are just the unnamed spaces in between streets . &quot;
He leaves , a little confused and disappointed .
So , now imagine you &apos;re standing on a street , anywhere in Japan , you turn to a person next to you and say , &quot; Excuse me , what is the name of this street ? &quot;
They say , &quot; Oh , well that &apos;s Block 17 and this is Block 16 . &quot;
And you say , &quot; OK , but what is the name of this street ? &quot;
And they say , &quot; Well , streets don &apos;t have names .
Blocks have names .
Just look at Google Maps here . There &apos;s Block 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 .
All of these blocks have names , and the streets are just the unnamed spaces in between the blocks .
And you say then , &quot; OK , then how do you know your home address ? &quot;
He said , &quot; Well , easy , this is District Eight .
There &apos;s Block 17 , house number one . &quot;
You say , &quot; OK , but walking around the neighborhood , I noticed that the house numbers don &apos;t go in order . &quot;
He says , &quot; Of course they do . They go in the order in which they were built .
The first house ever built on a block is house number one .
The second house ever built is house number two .
Third is house number three . It &apos;s easy . It &apos;s obvious . &quot;
So , I love that sometimes we need to go to the opposite side of the world to realize assumptions we didn &apos;t even know we had , and realize that the opposite of them may also be true .
So , for example , there are doctors in China who believe that it &apos;s their job to keep you healthy .
So , any month you are healthy you pay them , and when you &apos;re sick you don &apos;t have to pay them because they failed at their job . They get rich when you &apos;re healthy , not sick .
In most music , we think of the &quot; one &quot; as the downbeat , the beginning of the musical phrase : one , two , three , four .
But in West African music , the &quot; one &quot; is thought of as the end of the phrase , like the period at the end of a sentence .
So , you can hear it not just in the phrasing , but the way they count off their music : two , three , four , one .
And this map is also accurate .
There &apos;s a saying that whatever true thing you can say about India , the opposite is also true .
So , let &apos;s never forget , whether at TED , or anywhere else , that whatever brilliant ideas you have or hear , that the opposite may also be true .

&lt; url &gt; http : / / www.ted.com / talks / arthur _ benjamin _ does _ mathemagic.html &lt; / url &gt;
Well , good morning ladies and gentlemen .
My name is Art Benjamin , and I am a &quot; mathemagician . &quot;
What that means is , I combine my loves of math and magic to do something I call &quot; mathemagics . &quot;
But before I get started , I have a quick question for the audience .
By any chance , did anyone happen to bring with them this morning a calculator ?
Seriously , if you have a calculator with you , raise your hand , raise your hand .
I -- was -- your hand go up ?
Now bring it out , bring it out . Anybody else ?
I see , I see one way in the back .
You sir , that &apos;s three , And anybody on this side here ?
OK , you over there on the aisle . Would the four of you with calculators please bring out your calculators , then join me up on stage .
And let &apos;s give these volunteers a nice round of applause .
That &apos;s right . Now , since I haven &apos;t had the chance to work with these calculators , I need to make sure that they are all working properly .
Would somebody get us started by giving us a two-digit number please ?
How about a two-digit number ?
Audience : 22 .
Arthur Benjamin : 22 . And another two-digit number , Sir ?
Audience : 47 .
Multiply 22 times 47 , make sure you get 1,034 , or the calculators are not working . Do all of you get 1,034 ? 1,034 ?
No .
594 . Let &apos;s give three of them a nice round of applause there .
Would you like to try a more standard calculator , just in case ?
OK , great .
What I &apos;m going to try and do then -- I notice that took some of you a little bit of time to get your answer .
That &apos;s OK . I &apos;ll give you a shortcut for multiplying even faster on the calculator .
There is something called the square of a number , which most of you know is taking a number and multiplying it by itself .
For instance , five squared would be ?
Audience : 25 .
25 . Now , the way we can square on most calculators -- let me demonstrate with this one -- is by taking the number , such as five , hitting &quot; times &quot; and then &quot; equals , &quot; and on most calculators that will give you the square .
On some of these ancient RPN calculators , you &apos;ve got an &quot; x squared &quot; button on it , will allow you to do the calculation even faster .
What I &apos;m going to try and do now is to square , in my head , four two-digit numbers faster than they can do on their calculators , even using the shortcut method .
What I &apos;ll use is the second row this time , and I &apos;ll get four of you -- one , two , three , four -- to each yell out a two-digit number , and if you would square the first number , and if you would square the second , the third and the fourth , I will try and race you to the answer . OK ?
So quickly , a two-digit number please .
Audience : 37 .
37 squared , OK .
Audience : 23 .
23 squared , OK .
Audience : 59 .
59 squared , OK , and finally ?
Audience : 93 .
93 squared . Would you call out your answers , please ?
1369 . 1369 .
529 .
529 .
3481 .
3481 .
8649 .
Thank you very much .
Let me try to take this one step further .
I &apos;m going to try to square some three-digit numbers this time .
I won &apos;t even write these down -- I &apos;ll just call them out as they &apos;re called out to me .
Anyone I point to , call out a three-digit number .
Anyone on our panel , verify the answer .
Just give some indication if it &apos;s right .
A three-digit number , sir , yes ?
Audience : 987 .
987 squared is 974,169 .
Yes ? Good .
Another , another three-digit -- -- another three-digit number , sir ?
Audience : 457 .
457 squared is 205,849 .
205,849 ?
Yes ?
OK , another , another three-digit number , sir ?
Audience : 321 .
321 is 103,041 . 103,041 .
Yes ? One more three-digit number please .
Audience : Oh , 722 .
722 is 500 -- ooh , that &apos;s a harder one .
Is that 513,284 ?
Yes .
Yes ? Oh , one more , one more three-digit number please .
Audience : 162 .
162 squared is 26,244 .
Thank you very much .
Let me try to take this one step further .
I &apos;m going to try to square a four-digit number this time .
Now you can all take your time on this ; I will not beat you to the answer on this one , but I will try to get the answer right .
To make this a little bit more random , let &apos;s take the fourth row this time , let &apos;s say , one , two , three , four .
If each of you would call out a single digit between zero and nine , that will be the four-digit number that I &apos;ll square .
Audience : Nine .
Nine .
Audience : Seven . Seven .
Audience : Five . Five .
Audience : Eight . Eight .
9,758 , this will take me a little bit of time , so bear with me .
95,218,564 ?
Yes .
Thank you very much .
Now , I would attempt to square a five-digit number -- and I can -- but unfortunately most calculators cannot .
Eight-digit capacity -- don &apos;t you hate that ?
So , since we &apos;ve reached the limits of our calculators -- what &apos;s that ? Does yours go -- I don &apos;t know .
Does yours go higher ?
Oh -- yours does ?
I can probably do it .
I &apos;ll talk to you later .
In the meanwhile , let me conclude the first part of my show by doing something a little trickier .
Let &apos;s take the largest number on the board here , 8649 .
Would you each enter that on your calculator ?
And instead of squaring it this time , I want you to take that number and multiply it by any three-digit number that you want , but don &apos;t tell me what you &apos;re multiplying by -- just multiply it by any random three-digit number .
So you should have as an answer either a six-digit or probably a seven-digit number .
How many digits do you have , six or seven ?
Seven , and yours ? Seven .
Seven ? Seven ?
And , uncertain .
Yeah .
Seven . Is there any possible way that I could know what seven digit numbers you have ? Say &quot; No . &quot;
Good . Then I shall attempt the impossible -- or at least the improbable .
What I &apos;d like each of you to do is to call out for me any six of your seven digits , any six of them , in any order you &apos;d like .
One digit at a time , I shall try and determine the digit you &apos;ve left out .
So , starting with your seven-digit number , call out any six of them please .
One , OK , 197042 .
Did you leave out the number 6 ?
Yes , Good , OK , that &apos;s one .
You have a seven-digit number , call out any six of them please .
44875 .
I think I only heard five numbers . I -- wait -- 44875 -- did you leave out the number 6 ?
Yes . Same as she did , OK . You &apos;ve got a seven-digit number -- call out any six of them loud and clear .
079044 .
I think you left out the number 3 ?
That &apos;s three . The odds of me getting all four of these right by random guessing would be one in 10,000 : 10 to the fourth power .
OK , any six of them .
Really scramble them up this time , please .
263972 .
Did you leave out the number 7 ?
And let &apos;s give all four of these people a nice round of applause .
Thank you very much .
For my next number -- while I mentally recharge my batteries , I have one more question for the audience .
By any chance , does anybody here happen to know the day of the week that they were born on ?
If you think you know your birth day , raise your hand .
Let &apos;s see , starting with -- let &apos;s start with a gentleman first , OK sir , what year was it , first of all ? That &apos;s why I start with a gentleman first .
What year ?
Audience : 1953 .
1953 , and the month ?
Audience : November . November what ?
Audience : 23rd .
23rd -- was that a Monday ? Audience : Yes .
Yes , good . Somebody else ? Who else would like -- see I don &apos;t -- haven &apos;t seen any women &apos;s hands up .
OK , it &apos;s -- how about you , what year ?
Audience : 1949 . 1949 , and the month ?
Audience : October . October what ?
Audience : Fifth .
Fifth -- was that a Wednesday ?
Yes , my -- I &apos;ll go way to the back right now , how about you ?
Yell it out , what year ? Audience : 1959 .
1959 , OK -- and the month ?
Audience : February .
February what ? Audience : Sixth .
Sixth -- was that a Friday ? Audience : Yes .
Good , how about the person behind her ?
Call -- call -- what year was it ?
Audience : 1947 . 1947 , and the month ?
Audience : May . May what ?
Audience : Seventh . Seventh -- would that be a Wednesday ?
Audience : Yes .
Thank you very much .
Anybody here who &apos;d like to know the day of the week they were born ?
We can do it that way .
Of course , I could just make up an answer and you wouldn &apos;t know , so I come prepared for that .
I brought with me a book of calendars .
It goes as far back into the past as 1800 , &apos; cause you never know .
I didn &apos;t mean to look at you , sir -- you were just sitting there .
Anyway , Chris , you can help me out here , if you wouldn &apos;t mind .
This is a book of calendars , and I &apos;ll ask -- who was it that wanted to know their birth day ? You sir ? OK .
What year was it , first of all ?
Audience : 1966 .
&apos;66 -- turn to the calendar with 1966 -- and what month ?
Audience : April . April what ?
Audience : 17th . 17th -- I believe that was a Sunday .
Can you confirm , Chris ?
Yes . Yeah , OK . I &apos;ll tell you what , Chris : as long as you have that book in front of you , do me a favor , turn to a year outside of the 1900s , either into the 1800s or way into the 2000s -- that &apos;ll be a much greater challenge for me .
What year , Chris , would you like ?
1824 .
1824 , OK .
And what month ? June .
June what ? Sixth .
Sixth -- was that a Sunday ?
It was . And it was cloudy .
Good , thank you very much .
But I &apos;d like to wrap things up now by alluding to something from earlier in the presentation .
There was a gentleman up here who had a 10-digit calculator .
Where is he , would you stand up , 10-digit guy ?
OK , well stand up for me just for a second , so I can see where you are .
OK , oh , OK -- you have a 10-digit calculator , sir , as well ?
OK , what I &apos;m going to try and do , is to square in my head a five-digit number requiring a 10-digit calculator .
But to make my job more interesting for you , as well as for me , I &apos;m going to do this problem thinking out loud .
So you can actually , honestly hear what &apos;s going on in my mind while I do a calculation of this size .
Now , I have to apologize to our magician friend Lennart Green .
I know as a magician we &apos;re not supposed to reveal our secrets , but I &apos;m not too afraid that people are going to start doing my show next week , so -- I think we &apos;re OK .
So , let &apos;s see , let &apos;s take a -- let &apos;s take a different row of people , starting with you .
I &apos;ll get five digits : one , two , three , four -- oh , I did this row already . Let &apos;s do the row before you , starting with you sir : one , two , three , four , five .
Call out a single digit -- that will be the five-digit number that I will try to square . Go ahead .
Audience : Five . Five .
Audience : Seven . Seven .
Audience : Six . Six .
Audience : Eight . Eight .
Audience : Three . Three .
57,683 squared . Yuck .
Let me explain to you how I &apos;m going to attempt this problem .
I &apos;m going to break the problem down into three parts .
I &apos;ll do 57,000 squared , plus 683 squared , plus 57,000 times 683 times two .
Add all those numbers together , and with any luck , arrive at the answer .
Now , let me recap .
Thank you .
While I explain something else -- -- I know , that you can use , right ?
While I do these calculation &#91; s &#93; , you might hear certain words , as opposed to numbers , creep into the calculation .
Let me explain what that is .
This is a phonetic code , a mnemonic device that I use , that allows me to convert numbers into words .
I store them as words , and later on retrieve them as numbers .
I know it sounds complicated ; it &apos;s not -- I just don &apos;t want you to think you &apos;re seeing something out of &quot; Rain Man &quot; here .
There &apos;s definitely a method to my madness -- definitely , definitely . Sorry .
If you want to talk to me about ADHD afterwards , you can talk to me then . All right -- by the way , one last instruction , for my judges with the calculators -- OK , you know who you are -- there is at least a 50 percent chance that I will make a mistake here .
If I do , don &apos;t tell me what the mistake is ; just say , &quot; you &apos;re close , &quot; or something like that , and I &apos;ll try and figure out the answer -- which could be pretty entertaining in itself .
If , however , I am right , whatever you do , don &apos;t keep it to yourself , OK ?
Make sure everybody knows that I got the answer right , because this is my big finish , OK .
So , without any more stalling , here we go .
I &apos;ll start the problem in the middle , with 57 times 683 .
Now , 57 times 68 is 3,400 , plus 476 is 3876 , that &apos;s 38,760 plus 171 , 38,760 plus 171 is 38,931 .
38,931 ; double that to get 77,862 .
77,862 becomes cookie fission , cookie fission is 77,822 .
That seems right , I &apos;ll go on . Cookie fission , OK .
Next , I do 57 squared , which is 3,249 , so I can say , three billion . Take the 249 , add that to cookie , 249 , oops , but I see a carry coming -- 249 -- add that to cookie , 250 plus 77 , is 327 million -- fission , fission , OK , finally , we do 683 squared , that &apos;s 700 times 666 , plus 17 squared is 466,489 , rev up if I need it , rev up , take the 466 , add that to fission , to get , oh gee -- 328,489 .
Audience : Yeah !
Good .
Thank you very much .
I hope you enjoyed mathemagics . Thank you .

I &apos;m delighted to be here .
I &apos;m honored by the invitation , and thanks .
I would love to talk about stuff that I &apos;m interested in , but unfortunately , I suspect that what I &apos;m interested in won &apos;t interest many other people .
First off , my badge says I &apos;m an astronomer .
I would love to talk about my astronomy , but I suspect that the number of people who are interested in radiative transfer in non-gray atmospheres and polarization of light in Jupiter &apos;s upper atmosphere are the number of people who &apos;d fit in a bus shelter .
So I &apos;m not going to talk about that .
It would be just as much fun to talk about some stuff that happened in 1986 and 1987 , when a computer hacker is breaking into our systems over at Lawrence Berkeley Labs .
And I caught the guys , and they turned out to be working for what was then the Soviet KGB , and stealing information and selling it .
And I &apos;d love to talk about that -- and it &apos;d be fun -- but , 20 years later ...
I find computer security , frankly , to be kind of boring .
It &apos;s tedious .
I &apos;m -- The first time you do something , it &apos;s science .
The second time , it &apos;s engineering .
A third time , it &apos;s just being a technician .
I &apos;m a scientist . Once I do something , I do something else .
So , I &apos;m not going to talk about that .
Nor am I going to talk about what I think are obvious statements from my first book , &quot; Silicon Snake Oil , &quot; or my second book , nor am I going to talk about why I believe computers don &apos;t belong in schools .
I feel that there &apos;s a massive and bizarre idea going around that we have to bring more computers into schools .
My idea is : no ! No !
Get them out of schools , and keep them out of schools .
And I &apos;d love to talk about this , but I think the argument is so obvious to anyone who &apos;s hung around a fourth grade classroom that it doesn &apos;t need much talking about -- but I guess I may be very wrong about that , and everything else that I &apos;ve said .
So don &apos;t go back and read my dissertation .
It probably has lies in it as well .
Having said that , I outlined my talk about five minutes ago .
And if you look at it over here , the main thing I wrote on my thumb was the future .
I &apos;m supposed to talk about the future , yes ?
Oh , right . And my feeling is , asking me to talk about the future is bizarre , because I &apos;ve got gray hair , and so , it &apos;s kind of silly for me to talk about the future .
In fact , I think that if you really want to know what the future &apos;s going to be , if you really want to know about the future , don &apos;t ask a technologist , a scientist , a physicist .
No ! Don &apos;t ask somebody who &apos;s writing code .
No , if you want to know what society &apos;s going to be like in 20 years , ask a kindergarten teacher .
They know .
In fact , don &apos;t ask just any kindergarten teacher , ask an experienced one .
They &apos;re the ones who know what society is going to be like in another generation .
I don &apos;t . Nor , I suspect , do many other people who are talking about what the future will bring .
Certainly , all of us can imagine these cool new things that are going to be there .
But to me , things aren &apos;t the future .
What I ask myself is , what &apos;s society is going to be like , when the kids today are phenomenally good at text messaging and spend a huge amount of on-screen time , but have never gone bowling together ?
is not one that is in software .
But that &apos;s not what I &apos;m going to talk about .
I &apos;d love to talk about it , it &apos;d be fun , but I want to talk about what I &apos;m doing now . What am I doing now ?
Oh -- the other thing that I think I &apos;d like to talk about is right over here . Right over here .
Is that visible ? What I &apos;d like to talk about is one-sided things .
I would dearly love to talk about things that have one side .
Because I love Mobius loops . I not only love Mobius loops , but I &apos;m one of the very few people , if not the only person in the world , that makes Klein bottles .
Right away , I hope that all of your eyes glaze over .
This is a Klein bottle .
For those of you in the audience who know , you roll your eyes and say , yup , I know all about it .
It &apos;s one sided . It &apos;s a bottle whose inside is its outside .
It has zero volume . And it &apos;s non-orientable .
It has wonderful properties .
If you take two Mobius loops and sew their common edge together , you get one of these , and I make them out of glass .
And I &apos;d love to talk to you about this , but I don &apos;t have much in the way of ... things to say because -- However , the &quot; D &quot; in TED of course stands for design .
Just two weeks ago I made -- you know , I &apos;ve been making small , medium and big Klein bottles for the trade .
But what I &apos;ve just made -- and I &apos;m delighted to show you , first time in public here .
This is a Klein bottle wine bottle , which , although in four dimensions it shouldn &apos;t be able to hold any fluid at all , it &apos;s perfectly capable of doing so because our universe has only three spatial dimensions .
And because our universe is only three spatial dimensions , it can hold fluids .
So it &apos;s highly -- that one &apos;s the cool one .
That was a month of my life .
But although I would love to talk about topology with you , I &apos;m not going to .
Instead , I &apos;m going to mention my mom , who passed away last summer .
Had collected photographs of me , as mothers will do .
Could somebody put this guy up ?
And I looked over her album and she had collected a picture of me , standing -- well , sitting -- in 1969 , in front of a bunch of dials .
And I looked at it , and said , oh my god , that was me , when I was working at the electronic music studio !
As a technician , repairing and maintaining the electronic music studio at SUNY Buffalo . And wow !
Way back machine . And I said to myself , oh yeah !
And it sent me back .
Soon after that , I found in another picture that she had , a picture of me .
This guy over here of course is me .
This man is Robert Moog , the inventor of the Moog synthesizer , who passed away this past August .
Robert Moog was a generous , kind person , extraordinarily competent engineer .
A musician who took time from his life to teach me , a sophomore , a freshman at SUNY Buffalo .
He &apos;d come up from Trumansburg to teach me not just about the Moog synthesizer , but we &apos;d be sitting there -- I &apos;m studying physics at the time . This is 1969 , 70 , 71 .
We &apos;re studying physics , I &apos;m studying physics , and he &apos;s saying , &quot; That &apos;s a good thing to do .
Don &apos;t get caught up in electronic music if you &apos;re doing physics . &quot;
Mentoring me . He &apos;d come up and spend hours and hours with me .
He wrote a letter of recommendation for me to get into graduate school .
In the background , my bicycle .
I realize that this picture was taken at a friend &apos;s living room .
Bob Moog came by and hauled a whole pile of equipment to show Greg Flint and I things about this .
We sat around talking about Fourier transforms , Bessel functions , modulation transfer functions , stuff like this .
Bob &apos;s passing this past summer has been a loss to all of us .
Anyone who &apos;s a musician has been profoundly influenced by Robert Moog .
And I &apos;ll just say what I &apos;m about to do . What I &apos;m about to do -- I hope you can recognize that there &apos;s a distorted sine wave , almost a triangular wave upon this Hewlett-Packard oscilloscope .
Oh , cool . I can get to this place over here , right ?
Kids . Kids is what I &apos;m going to talk about -- is that okay ?
It says kids over here , that &apos;s what I &apos;d like to talk about .
I &apos;ve decided that , for me at least , I don &apos;t have a big enough head .
So I think locally and I act locally .
I feel that the best way I can help out anything is to help out very , very locally .
So Ph.D. this , and degree there , and the yadda yadda .
I was talking about this stuff to some schoolteachers about a year ago .
And one of them , several of them would come up to me and say , &quot; Well , how come you ain &apos;t teaching ? &quot;
And I said , &quot; Well , I &apos;ve taught graduate -- I &apos;ve had graduate students , I &apos;ve taught undergraduate classes . &quot;
No , they said , &quot; If you &apos;re so into kids and all this stuff , how come you ain &apos;t over here on the front lines ?
Put your money where you mouth is . &quot;
Is true . Is true . I teach eighth-grade science four days a week .
Not just showing up every now and then .
No , no , no , no , no . I take attendance .
I take lunch hour .
This is not -- no , no , no , this is not claps .
I strongly suggest that this is a good thing for each of you to do .
Not just show up to class every now and then .
Teach a solid week . Okay , I &apos;m teaching three-quarters time , but good enough .
One of the things that I &apos;ve done for my science students is to tell them , &quot; Look , I &apos;m going to teach you college-level physics .
No calculus , I &apos;ll cut out that .
You won &apos;t need to know trig .
But you will need to know eighth-grade algebra , and we &apos;re going to do serious experiments .
None of this open-to-chapter-seven-and-do-all-the-odd-problem-sets .
We &apos;re going to be doing genuine physics . &quot;
And that &apos;s one of the things I thought I &apos;d do right now .
Oh , before I even turn that on , one of the things that we did about three weeks ago in my class -- this is through the lens , and one of the things we used a lens for was to measure the speed of light .
My students in El Cerrito -- with my help , of course , and with the help of a very beat up oscilloscope -- measured the speed of light .
We were off by 25 percent . How many eighth graders do you know of who have measured the speed of light ?
In addition to that , we &apos;ve measured the speed of sound .
I &apos;d love to measure the speed of light here .
I was all set to do it and I was thinking , &quot; Aw man , &quot; I was just going to impose upon the powers that be , and measure the speed of light .
And I &apos;m all set to do it . I &apos;m all set to do it , but then it turns out that to set up here , you have like 10 minutes to set up !
And there &apos;s no time to do it .
So , next time , maybe , I &apos;ll measure the speed of light !
But meanwhile , let &apos;s measure the speed of sound !
Well , the obvious way to measure the speed of sound is to bounce sound off something and look at the echo .
But , probably -- one of my students , Ariel &#91; unclear &#93; , said , &quot; Could we measure the speed of light using the wave equation ? &quot;
And all of you know the wave equation is the frequency times the wavelength of any wave ...
is a constant . When the frequency goes up , the wavelength comes down . Wavelength goes up , frequency goes down . So , if we have a wave here -- over here , that &apos;s what &apos;s interesting -- as the pitch goes up , things get closer , pitch goes down , things stretch out .
Right ? This is simple physics .
All of you know this from eighth grade , remember ?
What they didn &apos;t tell you in physics -- in eighth-grade physics -- but they should have , and I wish they had , was that if you multiply the frequency times the wavelength of sound or light , you get a constant .
And that constant is the speed of sound .
So , in order to measure the speed of sound , all I &apos;ve got to do is know its frequency . Well , that &apos;s easy .
I &apos;ve got a frequency counter right here .
Set it up to around A , above A , above A. There &apos;s an A , more or less .
Now , so I know the frequency .
It &apos;s 1.76 kilohertz . I measure its wavelength .
All I need now is to flip on another beam , and the bottom beam is me talking , right ?
So anytime I talk , you &apos;d see it on the screen .
I &apos;ll put it over here , and as I move this away from the source , you &apos;ll notice the spiral .
The slinky moves . We &apos;re going through different nodes of the wave , coming out this way .
Those of you who are physicists , I hear you rolling your eyes , but bear with me .
To measure the wavelength , all I need to do is measure the distance from here -- one full wave -- over to here .
From here to here is the wavelength of sound .
So , I &apos;ll put a measuring tape here , measuring tape here , move it back over to here .
I &apos;ve moved the microphone 20 centimeters .
0.2 meters from here , back to here , 20 centimeters .
OK , let &apos;s go back to Mr. Elmo .
And we &apos;ll say the frequency is 1.76 kilohertz , or 1760 .
The wavelength was 0.2 meters .
Let &apos;s figure out what this is .
1.76 times 0.2 over here is 352 meters per second .
If you look it up in the book , it &apos;s really 343 .
But , here with kludgy material , and lousy drink -- we &apos;ve been able to measure the speed of sound to -- not bad . Pretty good .
All of which comes to what I wanted to say .
Go back to this picture of me a million years ago .
It was 1971 , the Vietnam War was going on , and I &apos;m like , &quot; Oh my God ! &quot;
I &apos;m studying physics : Landau , Lipschitz , Resnick and Halliday .
I &apos;m going home for a midterm . A riot &apos;s going on on campus .
There &apos;s a riot ! Hey , Elmo &apos;s done : off .
There &apos;s a riot going on on campus , and the police are chasing me , right ?
I &apos;m walking across campus . Cop comes and looks at me and says , &quot; You ! You &apos;re a student . &quot;
Pulls out a gun . Goes boom !
And a tear gas canister the size of a Pepsi can goes by my head . Whoosh !
I get a breath of tear gas and I can &apos;t breathe .
This cop comes after me with a rifle .
He wants to clunk me over the head !
I &apos;m saying , &quot; I got to clear out of here ! &quot;
I go running across campus quick as I can . I duck into Hayes Hall .
It &apos;s one of these bell-tower buildings .
The cop &apos;s chasing me .
Chasing me up the first floor , second floor , third floor .
Chases me into this room .
The entranceway to the bell tower .
I slam the door behind me , climb up , go past this place where I see a pendulum ticking .
And I &apos;m thinking , &quot; Oh yeah , the square root of the length is proportional to its period . &quot;
I keep climbing up , go back .
I go to a place where a dowel splits off .
There &apos;s a clock , clock , clock , clock .
The time &apos;s going backwards because I &apos;m inside of it .
I &apos;m thinking of Lorenz contractions and Einsteinian relativity .
I climb up , and there &apos;s this place , way in the back , that you climb up this wooden ladder .
I pop up the top , and there &apos;s a cupola .
A dome , one of these ten-foot domes .
I &apos;m looking out and I &apos;m seeing the cops bashing students &apos; heads , shooting tear gas , and watching students throwing bricks .
And I &apos;m asking , &quot; What am I doing here ? Why am I here ? &quot;
Then I remember what my English teacher in high school said .
Namely , that when they cast bells , they write inscriptions on them .
So , I wipe the pigeon manure off one of the bells , and I look at it .
I &apos;m asking myself , &quot; Why am I here ? &quot;
So , at this time , I &apos;d like to tell you the words inscribed upon the Hayes Hall tower bells : &quot; All truth is one .
In this light , may science and religion endeavor here for the steady evolution of mankind , from darkness to light , from narrowness to broad-mindedness , from prejudice to tolerance .
It is the voice of life , which calls us to come and learn . &quot;
Thank you very much .

What &apos;s in the box ?
Whatever it is must be pretty important , because I &apos;ve traveled with it , moved it , from apartment to apartment to apartment .
Sound familiar ?
Did you know that we Americans have about three times the amount of space we did 50 years ago ?
Three times .
So you &apos;d think , with all this extra space , we &apos;d have plenty of room for all our stuff .
Nope .
There &apos;s a new industry in town , a 22 billion-dollar , 2.2 billion sq. ft. industry : that of personal storage .
So we &apos;ve got triple the space , but we &apos;ve become such good shoppers that we need even more space .
So where does this lead ?
Lots of credit card debt , huge environmental footprints , and perhaps not coincidentally , our happiness levels flat-lined over the same 50 years .
Well I &apos;m here to suggest there &apos;s a better way , that less might actually equal more .
I bet most of us have experienced at some point the joys of less : college -- in your dorm , traveling -- in a hotel room , camping -- rig up basically nothing , maybe a boat .
Whatever it was for you , I bet that , among other things , this gave you a little more freedom , a little more time .
So I &apos;m going to suggest that less stuff and less space are going to equal a smaller footprint .
It &apos;s actually a great way to save you some money .
And it &apos;s going to give you a little more ease in your life .
So I started a project called Life Edited at lifeedited.org to further this conversation and to find some great solutions in this area .
First up : crowd-sourcing my 420 sq. ft. apartment in Manhattan with partners Mutopo and Jovoto.com.
I wanted it all -- home office , sit down dinner for 10 , room for guests , and all my kite surfing gear .
With over 300 entries from around the world , I got it , my own little jewel box .
By buying a space that was 420 sq. ft .
instead of 600 , immediately I &apos;m saving 200 grand .
Smaller space is going to make for smaller utilities -- save some more money there , but also a smaller footprint .
And because it &apos;s really designed around an edited set of possessions -- my favorite stuff -- and really designed for me , I &apos;m really excited to be there .
So how can you live little ?
Three main approaches .
First of all , you have to edit ruthlessly .
We &apos;ve got to clear the arteries of our lives .
And that shirt that I hadn &apos;t worn in years ?
It &apos;s time for me to let it go .
We &apos;ve got to cut the extraneous out of our lives , and we &apos;ve got to learn to stem the inflow .
We need to think before we buy .
Ask ourselves , &quot; Is that really going to make me happier ? Truly ? &quot;
By all means , we should buy and own some great stuff .
But we want stuff that we &apos;re going to love for years , not just stuff .
Secondly , our new mantra : small is sexy .
We want space efficiency .
We want things that are designed for how they &apos;re used the vast majority of the time , not that rare event .
Why have a six burner stove when you rarely use three ?
So we want things that nest , we want things that stack , and we want it digitized .
You can take paperwork , books , movies , and you can make it disappear -- it &apos;s magic .
Finally , we want multifunctional spaces and housewares -- a sink combined with a toilet , a dining table becomes a bed -- same space , a little side table stretches out to seat 10 .
In the winning Life Edited scheme in a render here , we combine a moving wall with transformer furniture to get a lot out of the space .
Look at the coffee table -- it grows in height and width to seat 10 .
My office folds away , easily hidden .
My bed just pops out of the wall with two fingers .
Guests ? Move the moving wall , have some fold-down guest beds .
And of course , my own movie theater .
So I &apos;m not saying that we all need to live in 420 sq. ft .
But consider the benefits of an edited life .
Go from 3,000 to 2,000 , from 1,500 to 1,000 .
Most of us , maybe all of us , are here pretty happily for a bunch of days with a couple of bags , maybe a small space , a hotel room .
So when you go home and you walk through your front door , take a second and ask yourselves , &quot; Could I do with a little life editing ?
Would that give me a little more freedom ?
Maybe a little more time ? &quot;
What &apos;s in the box ?
It doesn &apos;t really matter .
I know I don &apos;t need it .
What &apos;s in yours ?
Maybe , just maybe , less might equal more .
So let &apos;s make room for the good stuff .
Thank you .

Photography has been my passion ever since I was old enough to pick up a camera , but today I want to share with you the 15 most treasured photos of mine , and I didn &apos;t take any of them .
There were no art directors , no stylists , no chance for reshoots , not even any regard for lighting .
In fact , most of them were taken by random tourists .
My story begins when I was in New York City for a speaking engagement , and my wife took this picture of me holding my daughter on her first birthday . We &apos;re on the corner of 57th and 5th .
We happened to be back in New York exactly a year later , so we decided to take the same picture .
Well you can see where this is going .
Approaching my daughter &apos;s third birthday , my wife said , &quot; Hey , why don &apos;t you take Sabina back to New York and make it a father-daughter trip , and continue the ritual ? &quot;
This is when we started asking passing tourists to take the picture .
You know , it &apos;s remarkable how universal the gesture is of handing your camera to a total stranger .
No one &apos;s ever refused , and luckily no one &apos;s ever run off with our camera .
Back then , we had no idea how much this trip would change our lives .
It &apos;s really become sacred to us .
This one was taken just weeks after 9 / 11 , and I found myself trying to explain what had happened that day in ways a five-year-old could understand .
So these photos are far more than proxies for a single moment , or even a specific trip .
They &apos;re also ways for us to freeze time for one week in October and reflect on our times and how we change from year to year , and not just physically , but in every way .
Because while we take the same photo , our perspectives change , and she reaches new milestones , and I get to see life through her eyes , and how she interacts with and sees everything .
This very focused time we get to spend together is something we cherish and anticipate the entire year .
Recently , on one trip , we were walking , and she stops dead in her tracks , and she points to a red awning of the doll store that she loved when she was little on our earlier trips .
And she describes to me the feeling she felt as a five-year-old standing in that exact spot .
She said she remembers her heart bursting out of her chest when she saw that place for the very first time nine years earlier .
And now what she &apos;s looking at in New York are colleges , because she &apos;s determined to go to school in New York .
And it hit me : One of the most important things we all make are memories .
So I want to share the idea of taking an active role in consciously creating memories .
I don &apos;t know about you , but aside from these 15 shots , I &apos;m not in many of the family photos .
I &apos;m always the one taking the picture .
So I want to encourage everyone today to get in the shot , and don &apos;t hesitate to go up to someone and ask , &quot; Will you take our picture ? &quot;
Thank you .

&lt; title &gt; Steven Addis : A father-daughter bond , one photo at a time &lt; / title &gt;
&lt; description &gt; A long time ago in New York City , Steve Addis stood on a corner holding his 1-year-old daughter in his arms ; his wife snapped a photo . The image has inspired an annual father-daughter ritual , where Addis and his daughter pose for the same picture , on the same corner , each year . Addis shares 15 treasured photographs from the series , and explores why this small , repeated ritual means so much . &lt; / description &gt;

Hey , I am Michael Shermer , the director of the Skeptics Society , the publisher of &quot; Skeptic &quot; magazine .
We investigate claims of the paranormal , pseudo-science , and fringe groups and cults and claims of all kinds between -- science and pseudo-science and non-science and junk science , voodoo science , pathological science , bad science , non-science and plain old nonsense .
And unless you &apos;ve been on Mars recently , you know there &apos;s a lot of that out there .
Some people call us debunkers , which is kind of a negative term .
But let &apos;s face it -- there &apos;s a lot of bunk , and we are like the bunko squads of the police departments out there , flushing out .
Well , we &apos;re sort of like the Ralph Naders of bad ideas -- trying to replace bad ideas with good ideas .
I &apos;ll show you an example of a bad idea .
I brought this with me .
This was given to us by NBC Dateline to test .
It &apos;s the -- it &apos;s produced by the Quadro Corporation of West Virginia .
It &apos;s called the Quadro 2000 Dowser Rod .
This was being sold to high school administrators for 900 dollars a piece .
It &apos;s a piece of plastic with a Radio Shack antenna attached to it .
You could dowse for all sorts of things , but this particular one was built to dowse for marijuana in students &apos; lockers .
So the way it works is , you go down the hallway and you see if it tilts toward a particular locker , and then you open the locker .
So it looks something like this .
I &apos;ll show you .
No , it -- well , it has kind of a right-leaning bias .
So , I &apos;ll show -- well , this is science , so we &apos;ll do a controlled experiment .
It &apos;ll go this way for sure .
Sir , you want to empty your pockets . Please , sir ?
So the question was , can it actually find marijuana in students &apos; lockers ?
And the answer is , if you open enough of them , yes .
But in science , we have to keep track of the misses , not just the hits .
And that &apos;s probably the key lesson to my short talk here , is that this is how psychics work , astrologers , and tarot card readers and so on .
People remember the hits ; they forget the misses .
In science we have to keep the whole database , and look to see if the number of hits somehow stands out from the total number that you would expect by chance .
In this case , we tested it .
We had two opaque boxes : one with government-approved THC marijuana , and one with nothing .
And it got it 50 percent of the time -- which is exactly what you &apos;d expect with a coin flip model .
So that &apos;s just a fun little example here of the sorts of things we do .
&quot; Skeptic &quot; is the quarterly publication .
Each one has a particular theme , like this one is on the future of intelligence .
Are people getting smarter or dumber ?
I have an opinion of this myself because of the business I &apos;m in , but , in fact , people , it turns out , are getting smarter .
Three IQ points per 10 years , going up .
Sort of an interesting thing .
With science , don &apos;t think of skepticism as a thing or even science as a thing .
Are science and religion compatible ?
It &apos;s like , are science and plumbing compatible ?
These -- they &apos;re just two different things .
Science is not a thing . It &apos;s a verb .
It &apos;s a way of thinking about things .
It &apos;s a way of looking for natural explanations for all phenomena .
I mean , what &apos;s more likely : that extraterrestrial intelligences or multi-dimensional beings travel across the vast distances of interstellar space to leave a crop circle in Farmer Bob &apos;s field in Puckerbrush , Kansas to promote skeptic.com , our webpage ?
Or is it more likely that a reader of &quot; Skeptic &quot; did this with Photoshop ?
And in all cases we have to ask -- what &apos;s the more likely explanation ?
And before we say something is out of this world , we should first make sure that it &apos;s not in this world .
What &apos;s more likely -- that Arnold had a little extraterrestrial help in his run for the governorship ?
Or that the &quot; World Weekly News &quot; makes stuff up ?
And part of that -- the same theme is expressed nicely here in this Sidney Harris cartoon .
For those of you in the back , it says here : &quot; Then a miracle occurs .
I think you need to be more explicit here in step two . &quot;
This single slide completely dismantles the intelligent design arguments .
There &apos;s nothing more to it than that .
You can say a miracle occurs .
It &apos;s just that it doesn &apos;t explain anything .
It doesn &apos;t offer anything . There &apos;s nothing to test .
It &apos;s the end of the conversation for intelligent design creationists .
Whereas -- and it &apos;s true , scientists sometimes throw terms out as linguistic place fillers -- dark energy or dark matter or something like that -- until we figure out what it is , we &apos;ll just call it this -- it &apos;s the beginning of the causal chain for science .
For intelligent design creationists , it &apos;s the end of the chain .
So again , we can ask this : what &apos;s more likely ?
Are UFOs alien spaceships or perceptual cognitive mistakes -- or even fakes ?
This is a UFO shot from my house in Altadena , California , looking down over Pasadena .
And if it looks a lot like a Buick hubcap , it &apos;s because it is .
You don &apos;t even need Photoshop ; you don &apos;t need high-tech equipment ; you don &apos;t need computers .
This was shot with a throwaway Kodak Instamatic camera .
You just have somebody off on the side with a hubcap ready to go .
Camera &apos;s ready -- that &apos;s it .
So , although it &apos;s possible that most of these things are fake or illusions or so on and that some of them are real , it &apos;s more likely that all of them are fake , like the crop circles .
On a more serious note , in all of science we &apos;re looking for a balance between data and theory .
In the case of Galileo , he had two problems when he turned his telescope to Saturn .
First of all , there was no theory of planetary rings .
And second of all , his data was grainy and fuzzy , and he couldn &apos;t quite make out what it was he was looking at .
So he wrote that he had seen -- &quot; I have observed that the furthest planet has three bodies . &quot;
And this is what he ended up concluding that he saw .
So without a theory of planetary rings and with only grainy data , you can &apos;t have a good theory .
And it wasn &apos;t solved until 1655 .
This is Christiaan Huygens &apos;s book in which he cataloged all the mistakes that people made in trying to figure out what was going on with Saturn .
It wasn &apos;t till -- Huygens had two things .
He had a good theory of planetary rings and how the solar system operated .
And then , he had better telescopic , more fine-grain data in which he could figure out that as the Earth is going around faster -- according to Kepler &apos;s Laws -- than Saturn , then we catch up with it .
And we see the angles of the rings at different angles , there .
And that , in fact , turns out to be true .
The problems with having a theory is that your theory may be loaded with cognitive biases .
So one of the problems of explaining why people believe weird things is that we have things on a simple level .
And then I &apos;ll go to more serious ones .
Like , we have a tendency to see faces .
This is the face on Mars , which was -- in 1976 , where there was a whole movement to get NASA to photograph that area because people thought this was monumental architecture made by Martians .
Well , it turns out -- here &apos;s the close-up of it from 2001 .
If you squint , you can still see the face .
And when you &apos;re squinting , what you &apos;re doing is you &apos;re turning that from fine-grain to coarse-grain .
And so , you &apos;re reducing the quality of your data .
And if I didn &apos;t tell you what to look for , you &apos;d still see the face , because we &apos;re programmed by evolution to see faces .
Faces are important for us socially .
And , of course , happy faces .
Faces of all kinds are easy to see .
You can see the happy face on Mars , there .
If astronomers were frogs perhaps they &apos;d see Kermit the Frog .
Do you see him there ?
Little froggy legs .
Or if geologists were elephants ?
Religious iconography .
Discovered by a Tennessee baker in 1996 .
He charged five bucks a head to come see the nun bun till he got a cease-and-desist from Mother Teresa &apos;s lawyer .
Here &apos;s Our Lady of Guadalupe and Our Lady of Watsonville , just down the street , or is it up the street from here ?
Tree bark is particularly good because it &apos;s nice and grainy , branchy , black-and-white splotchy and you can get the pattern-seeking -- humans are pattern-seeking animals .
Here &apos;s the Virgin Mary on the side of a glass window in Sao Paulo .
Now , here &apos;s the Virgin Mary made her appearance on a cheese sandwich -- which I got to actually hold in a Las Vegas casino , of course , this being America .
This casino paid 28,500 dollars on eBay for the cheese sandwich .
But who does it really look like , the Virgin Mary ?
It has that sort of puckered lips , 1940s-era look .
Virgin Mary in Clearwater , Florida .
I actually went to see this one .
There was a lot of people there -- the faithful come to be in their -- wheelchairs and crutches , and so on .
And we went down , investigated .
Just to give you a size -- that &apos;s Dawkins , me and The Amazing Randi , next to this two , two and a half story size image .
All these candles , so many thousands of candles people had lit in tribute to this .
So we walked around the backside , just to see what was going on here , where -- it turns out wherever there &apos;s a sprinkler head and a palm tree , you get the effect .
Here &apos;s the Virgin Mary on the backside , which they started to wipe off .
I guess you can only have one miracle per building .
So is it really a miracle of Mary , or is it a miracle of Marge ?
And then I &apos;m going to finish up with another example of this with audio -- auditory illusions .
There is this film , &quot; White Noise , &quot; with Michael Keaton about the dead talking back to us .
By the way , this whole business of talking to the dead , it &apos;s not that big a deal .
Anybody can do it , turns out .
It &apos;s getting the dead to talk back that &apos;s the really hard part .
In this case , supposedly , these messages are hidden in electronic phenomena .
There &apos;s a ReverseSpeech.com web page from which I downloaded this stuff .
Here is the forward -- this is the most famous one of all of these .
Here &apos;s the forward version of the very famous song .
Boy , couldn &apos;t you just listen to that all day ?
All right , here it is backwards , and see if you can hear the hidden messages that are supposedly in there .
What did you get ?
Michael Shermer : &quot; Satan ? &quot; OK , well , at least we got &quot; Satan . &quot;
Now , I &apos;ll prime your auditory part of your brain to tell you what you &apos;re supposed to hear , and then hear it again .
You can &apos;t miss it when I tell you what &apos;s there .
All right , I &apos;m going to just end with a positive , nice , little story about -- the Skeptics is a nonprofit educational organization .
We &apos;re always looking for little , good things that people do .
And in England , there &apos;s a pop singer .
Very -- one of the top popular singers in England today , Katie Melua .
And she wrote a beautiful song .
It was in the top five in 2005 , called , &quot; Nine Million Bicycles in Beijing . &quot;
It &apos;s a love story -- she &apos;s sort of the Norah Jones of the U.K. -- about how she much loves her guy , and compared to nine million bicycles , and so forth .
And she has this one passage here .
We are 12 billion light-years from the edge That &apos;s a guess No one can ever say it &apos;s true But I know that I will always be with you Well , that &apos;s nice .
At least she got it close .
In America it would be , &quot; We &apos;re 6,000 light years from the edge . &quot;
But my friend , Simon Singh , the particle physicist now turned science educator , and he wrote the book &quot; The Big Bang , &quot; and so on .
He uses every chance he gets to promote good science .
And so , he wrote an op-ed piece in &quot; The Guardian &quot; about Katie &apos;s song , in which he said , well , we know exactly how old , how far from the edge .
You know , it &apos;s 12 -- it &apos;s 13.7 billion light years , and it &apos;s not a guess .
We know within precise error bars there how close it is .
And so , we can say , although not absolutely true , that it &apos;s pretty close to being true .
And , to his credit , Katie called him up after this op-ed piece came out .
And said , &quot; I &apos;m so embarrassed .
I was a member of the astronomy club , and I should have known better . &quot;
And she re-cut the song .
So I &apos;ll end with the new version .
We are 13.7 billion light years from the edge of the observable universe That &apos;s a good estimate with well-defined error bars And with the available information I predict that I will always be with you How cool is that ?

With all the legitimate concerns about AIDS and avian flu -- and we &apos;ll hear about that from the brilliant Dr. Brilliant later today -- I want to talk about the other pandemic , which is cardiovascular disease , diabetes , hypertension -- all of which are completely preventable for at least 95 percent of people just by changing diet and lifestyle .
And what &apos;s happening is that there &apos;s a globalization of illness occurring , that people are starting to eat like us , and live like us , and die like us . And in one generation , for example , Asia &apos;s gone from having one of the lowest rates of heart disease and obesity and diabetes to one of the highest . And in Africa , cardiovascular disease equals the HIV and AIDS deaths in most countries .
So there &apos;s a critical window of opportunity we have to make an important difference that can affect the lives of literally millions of people , and practice preventive medicine on a global scale .
Heart and blood vessel diseases still kill more people -- not only in this country , but also worldwide -- than everything else combined , and yet it &apos;s completely preventable for almost everybody .
It &apos;s not only preventable ; it &apos;s actually reversible . And for the last almost 29 years , we &apos;ve been able to show that by simply changing diet and lifestyle , using these very high-tech , expensive , state-of-the-art measures to prove how powerful these very simple and low-tech and low-cost interventions can be like -- quantitative arteriography , before and after a year , and cardiac PET scans .
We showed a few months ago -- we published the first study showing you can actually stop or reverse the progression of prostate cancer by making changes in diet and lifestyle , and 70 percent regression in the tumor growth , or inhibition of the tumor growth , compared to only nine percent in the control group .
And in the MRI and MR spectroscopy here , the prostate tumor activity is shown in red -- you can see it diminishing after a year .
Now there is an epidemic of obesity : two-thirds of adults and 15 percent of kids . What &apos;s really concerning to me is that diabetes has increased 70 percent in the past 10 years , and this may be the first generation in which our kids live a shorter life span than we do . That &apos;s pitiful , and it &apos;s preventable .
Now these are not election returns , these are the people -- the number of the people who are obese by state , beginning in &apos; 85 , &apos; 86 , &apos; 87 -- these are from the CDC website -- &apos; 88 , &apos; 89 , &apos; 90 , &apos; 91 -- you get a new category -- &apos; 92 , &apos; 93 , &apos; 94 , &apos; 95 , &apos; 96 , &apos; 97 , &apos; 98 , &apos; 99 , 2000 , 2001 -- it gets worse . We &apos;re kind of devolving .
Now what can we do about this ? Well , you know , the diet that we &apos;ve found that can reverse heart disease and cancer is an Asian diet .
But the people in Asia are starting to eat like we are , which is why they &apos;re starting to get sick like we are .
So I &apos;ve been working with a lot of the big food companies . They can make it fun and sexy and hip and crunchy and convenient to eat healthier foods , like -- I chair the advisory boards to McDonald &apos;s , and PepsiCo , and ConAgra , and Safeway , and soon Del Monte , and they &apos;re finding that it &apos;s good business .
The salads that you see at McDonald &apos;s came from the work -- they &apos;re going to have an Asian salad . At Pepsi , two-thirds of their revenue growth came from their better foods .
And so if we can do that , then we can free up resources for buying drugs that you really do need for treating AIDS and HIV and malaria and for preventing avian flu . Thank you .

About four years ago , the New Yorker published an article about a cache of dodo bones that was found in a pit on the island of Mauritius .
Now , the island of Mauritius is a small island off the east coast of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean , and it is the place where the dodo bird was discovered and extinguished , all within about 150 years .
Everyone was very excited about this archaeological find , because it meant that they might finally be able to assemble a single dodo skeleton .
See , while museums all over the world have dodo skeletons in their collection , nobody -- not even the actual Natural History Museum on the island of Mauritius -- has a skeleton that &apos;s made from the bones of a single dodo .
Well , this isn &apos;t exactly true .
The fact is , is that the British Museum had a complete specimen of a dodo in their collection up until the 18th century -- it was actually mummified , skin and all -- but in a fit of space-saving zeal , they actually cut off the head and they cut off the feet and they burned the rest in a bonfire .
If you go look at their website today , they &apos;ll actually list these specimens , saying , the rest was lost in a fire .
Not quite the whole truth . Anyway .
The frontispiece of this article was this photo , and I &apos;m one of the people that thinks that Tina Brown was great for bringing photos to the New Yorker , because this photo completely rocked my world .
I became obsessed with the object -- not just the beautiful photograph itself , and the color , the shallow depth of field , the detail that &apos;s visible , the wire you can see on the beak there that the conservator used to put this skeleton together -- there &apos;s an entire story here .
And I thought to myself , wouldn &apos;t it be great if I had my own dodo skeleton ?
I want to point out here at this point that I &apos;ve spent my life obsessed by objects and the stories that they tell , and this was the very latest one .
So I began looking around for -- to see if anyone sold a kit , some kind of model that I could get , and I found lots of reference material , lots of lovely pictures .
No dice : no dodo skeleton for me . But the damage had been done .
I had saved a few hundred photos of dodo skeletons into my &quot; Creative Projects &quot; folder -- it &apos;s a repository for my brain , everything that I could possibly be interested in .
Any time I have an internet connection , there &apos;s a sluice of stuff moving into there , everything from beautiful rings to cockpit photos .
The key that the Marquis du Lafayette sent to George Washington to celebrate the storming of the Bastille .
Russian nuclear launch key : The one on the top is the picture of the one I found on eBay ; the one on the bottom is the one I made for myself , because I couldn &apos;t afford the one on eBay .
Storm trooper costumes . Maps of Middle Earth -- that &apos;s one I hand-drew myself . There &apos;s the dodo skeleton folder .
This folder has 17,000 photos -- over 20 gigabytes of information -- and it &apos;s growing constantly .
And one day , a couple of weeks later , it might have been maybe a year later , I was in the art store with my kids , and I was buying some clay tools -- we were going to have a craft day .
I bought some Super Sculpeys , some armature wire , some various materials .
And I looked down at this Sculpey , and I thought , maybe , yeah , maybe I could make my own dodo skull .
I should point out at this time -- I &apos;m not a sculptor ; I &apos;m a hard-edged model maker .
You give me a drawing , you give me a prop to replicate , you give me a crane , scaffolding , parts from &quot; Star Wars &quot; -- especially parts from &quot; Star Wars &quot; -- I can do this stuff all day long .
It &apos;s exactly how I made my living for 15 years .
But you give me something like this -- my friend Mike Murnane sculpted this ; it &apos;s a maquette for &quot; Star Wars , Episode Two &quot; -- this is not my thing -- this is something other people do -- dragons , soft things .
However , I felt like I had looked at enough photos of dodo skulls to actually be able to understand the topology and perhaps replicate it -- I mean , it couldn &apos;t be that difficult .
So , I started looking at the best photos I could find .
I grabbed all the reference , and I found this lovely piece of reference .
This is someone selling this on eBay ; it was clearly a woman &apos;s hand , hopefully a woman &apos;s hand .
Assuming it was roughly the size of my wife &apos;s hand , I made some measurements of her thumb , and I scaled them out to the size of the skull .
I blew it up to the actual size , and I began using that , along with all the other reference that I had , comparing it to it as size reference for figuring out exactly how big the beak should be , exactly how long , etc .
And over a few hours , I eventually achieved what was actually a pretty reasonable dodo skull . And I didn &apos;t mean to continue , I -- it &apos;s kind of like , you know , you can only clean a super messy room by picking up one thing at a time ; you can &apos;t think about the totality .
I wasn &apos;t thinking about a dodo skeleton ; I just noticed that as I finished this skull , the armature wire that I had been used to holding it up was sticking out of the back just where a spine would be .
And one of the other things I &apos;d been interested in and obsessed with over the years is spines and skeletons , having collected a couple of hundred .
I actually understood the mechanics of vertebrae enough to kind of start to imitate them .
And so button by button , vertebrae by vertebrae , I built my way down .
And actually , by the end of the day , I had a reasonable skull , a moderately good vertebrae and half of a pelvis .
And again , I kept on going , looking for more reference , every bit of reference I could find -- drawings , beautiful photos .
This guy -- I love this guy ! He put a dodo leg bones on a scanner with a ruler .
This is the kind of accuracy that I wanted , and I replicated every last bone and put it in .
And after about six weeks , I finished , painted , mounted my own dodo skeleton .
You can see that I even made a museum label for it that includes a brief history of the dodo .
And TAP Plastics made me -- although I didn &apos;t photograph it -- a museum vitrine .
I don &apos;t have the room for this in my house , but I had to finish what I had started .
And this actually represented kind of a sea change to me .
Again , like I said , my life has been about being fascinated by objects and the stories that they tell , and also making them for myself , obtaining them , appreciating them and diving into them .
And in this folder , &quot; Creative Projects , &quot; there are tons of projects that I &apos;m currently working on , projects that I &apos;ve already worked on , things that I might want to work on some day , and things that I may just want to find and buy and have and look at and touch .
But now there was potentially this new category of things that I could sculpt that was different , that I -- you know , I have my own R2D2 , but that &apos;s -- honestly , relative to sculpting , to me , that &apos;s easy .
And so I went back and looked through my &quot; Creative Projects &quot; folder , and I happened across the Maltese Falcon .
Now , this is funny for me : to fall in love with an object from a Hammett novel , because if it &apos;s true that the world is divided into two types of people , Chandler people and Hammett people , I am absolutely a Chandler person .
But in this case , it &apos;s not about the author , it &apos;s not about the book or the movie or the story , it &apos;s about the object in and of itself .
And in this case , this object is -- plays on a host of levels .
First of all , there &apos;s the object in the world .
This is the &quot; Kniphausen Hawk . &quot;
It is a ceremonial pouring vessel made around 1700 for a Swedish Count , and it is very likely the object from which Hammett drew his inspiration for the Maltese Falcon .
Then there is the fictional bird , the one that Hammett created for the book .
Built out of words , it is the engine that drives the plot of his book and also the movie , in which another object is created : a prop that has to represent the thing that Hammett created out of words , inspired by the Kniphausen Hawk , and this represents the falcon in the movie .
And then there is this fourth level , which is a whole new object in the world : the prop made for the movie , the representative of the thing , becomes , in its own right , a whole other thing , a whole new object of desire .
And so now it was time to do some research .
I actually had done some research a few years before -- it &apos;s why the folder was there .
I &apos;d bought a replica , a really crappy replica , of the Maltese Falcon on eBay , and had downloaded enough pictures to actually have some reasonable reference .
But I discovered , in researching further , really wanting precise reference , that one of the original lead birds had been sold at Christie &apos;s in 1994 , and so I contacted an antiquarian bookseller who had the original Christie &apos;s catalogue , and in it I found this magnificent picture , which included a size reference .
I was able to scan the picture , blow it up to exactly full size .
I found other reference . Avi &#91; Ara &#93; Chekmayan , a New Jersey editor , actually found this resin Maltese Falcon at a flea market in 1991 , although it took him five years to authenticate this bird to the auctioneers &apos; specifications , because there was a lot of controversy about it .
It was made out of resin , which wasn &apos;t a common material for movie props about the time the movie was made .
It &apos;s funny to me that it took a while to authenticate it , because I can see it compared to this thing , and I can tell you -- it &apos;s real , it &apos;s the real thing , it &apos;s made from the exact same mold that this one is .
In this one , because the auction was actually so controversial , Profiles in History , the auction house that sold this -- I think in 1995 for about 100,000 dollars -- they actually included -- you can see here on the bottom -- not just a front elevation , but also a side , rear and other side elevation .
So now , I had all the topology I needed to replicate the Maltese Falcon .
What do they do , how do you start something like that ? I really don &apos;t know .
So what I did was , again , like I did with the dodo skull , I blew all my reference up to full size , and then I began cutting out the negatives and using those templates as shape references .
So I took Sculpey , and I built a big block of it , and I passed it through until , you know , I got the right profiles .
And then slowly , feather by feather , detail by detail , I worked out and achieved -- working in front of the television and Super Sculpey -- here &apos;s me sitting next to my wife -- it &apos;s the only picture I took of the entire process .
As I moved through , I achieved a very reasonable facsimile of the Maltese Falcon .
But again , I am not a sculptor , and so I don &apos;t know a lot of the tricks , like , I don &apos;t know how my friend Mike gets beautiful , shiny surfaces with his Sculpey ; I certainly wasn &apos;t able to get it .
So , I went down to my shop , and I molded it and I cast it in resin , because in the resin , then , I could absolutely get the glass smooth finished .
Now there &apos;s a lot of ways to fill and get yourself a nice smooth finish .
My preference is about 70 coats of this -- matte black auto primer .
I spray it on for about three or four days , it drips to hell , but it allows me a really , really nice gentle sanding surface and I can get it glass-smooth .
Oh , finishing up with triple-zero steel wool .
Now , the great thing about getting it to this point was that because in the movie , when they finally bring out the bird at the end , and they place it on the table , they actually spin it .
So I was able to actually screen-shot and freeze-frame to make sure .
And I &apos;m following all the light kicks on this thing and making sure that as I &apos;m holding the light in the same position , I &apos;m getting the same type of reflection on it -- that &apos;s the level of detail I &apos;m going into this thing .
I ended up with this : my Maltese Falcon .
And it &apos;s beautiful . And I can state with authority at this point in time , when I &apos;d finished it , of all of the replicas out there -- and there is a few -- this is by far the most accurate representation of the original Maltese Falcon than anyone has sculpted . Now the original one , I should tell you , is sculpted by a guy named Fred Sexton .
This is where it gets weird .
Fred Sexton was a friend of this guy , George Hodel .
Terrifying guy -- agreed by many to be the killer of the Black Dahlia .
Now , James Ellroy believes that Fred Sexton , the sculptor of the Maltese Falcon , killed James Elroy &apos;s mother .
I &apos;ll go you one stranger than that : In 1974 , during the production of a weird comedy sequel to &quot; The Maltese Falcon , &quot; called &quot; The Black Bird , &quot; starring George Segal , the Los Angeles County Museum of Art had a plaster original of the Maltese Falcon -- one of the original six plasters , I think , made for the movie -- stolen out of the museum . A lot of people thought it was a publicity stunt for the movie .
John &apos;s Grill , which actually is seen briefly in &quot; The Maltese Falcon , &quot; is still a viable San Francisco eatery , counted amongst its regular customers Elisha Cook , who played Wilmer Cook in the movie , and he gave them one of his original plasters of the Maltese Falcon .
And they had it in their cabinet for about 15 years , until it got stolen in January of 2007 .
It would seem that the object of desire only comes into its own by disappearing repeatedly .
So here I had this Falcon , and it was lovely . It looked really great , the light worked on it really well , it was better than anything that I could achieve or obtain out in the world .
But there was a problem . And the problem was that : I wanted the entirety of the object , I wanted the weight behind the object .
This thing was made of resin and it was too light .
There &apos;s this group online that I frequent .
It &apos;s a group of prop crazies just like me called the Replica Props Forum , and it &apos;s people who trade , make and travel in information about movie props .
And it turned out that one of the guys there , a friend of mine that I never actually met , but befriended through some prop deals , was the manager of a local foundry .
He took my master Falcon pattern , he actually did lost wax casting in bronze for me , and this is the bronze I got back .
And this is , after some acid etching , the one that I ended up with .
And this thing , it &apos;s deeply , deeply satisfying to me .
Here , I &apos;m going to put it out there , later on tonight , and I want you to pick it up and handle it .
You want to know how obsessed I am . This project &apos;s only for me , and yet I went so far as to buy on eBay a 1941 Chinese San Francisco-based newspaper , in order so that the bird could properly be wrapped ...
like it is in the movie .
Yeah , I know !
There you can see , it &apos;s weighing in at 27 and a half pounds .
That &apos;s half the weight of my dog , Huxley .
But there &apos;s a problem .
Now , here &apos;s the most recent progression of Falcons .
On the far left is a piece of crap -- a replica I bought on eBay .
There &apos;s my somewhat ruined Sculpey Falcon , because I had to get it back out of the mold . There &apos;s my first casting , there &apos;s my master and there &apos;s my bronze .
There &apos;s a thing that happens when you mold and cast things , which is that every time you throw it into silicone and cast it in resin , you lose a little bit of volume , you lose a little bit of size .
And when I held my bronze one up against my Sculpey one , it was shorter by three-quarters of an inch .
Yeah , no , really , this was like aah -- why didn &apos;t I remember this ?
Why didn &apos;t I start and make it bigger ?
So what do I do ? I figure I have two options .
One , I can fire a freaking laser at it , which I have already done , to do a 3D scan -- there &apos;s a 3D scan of this Falcon .
I had figured out the exact amount of shrinkage I achieved going from a wax master to a bronze master and blown this up big enough to make a 3D lithography master of this , which I will polish , then I will send to the mold maker and then I will have it done in bronze . Or : There are several people who own originals , and I have been attempting to contact them and reach them , hoping that they will let me spend a few minutes in the presence of one of the real birds , maybe to take a picture , or even to pull out the hand-held laser scanner that I happen to own that fits inside a cereal box , and could maybe , without even touching their bird , I swear , get a perfect 3D scan . And I &apos;m even willing to sign pages saying that I &apos;ll never let anyone else have it , except for me in my office , I promise .
I &apos;ll give them one if they want it .
And then , maybe , then I &apos;ll achieve the end of this exercise .
But really , if we &apos;re all going to be honest with ourselves , I have to admit that achieving the end of the exercise was never the point of the exercise to begin with , was it .
Thank you .

My big idea is a very , very small idea that can unlock billions of big ideas that are at the moment dormant inside us .
And my little idea that will do that is sleep .
This is a room of type-A women .
This is a room of sleep-deprived women .
And I learned the hard way , the value of sleep .
Two-and-a-half years ago , I fainted from exhaustion .
I hit my head on my desk . I broke my cheekbone , I got five stitches on my right eye .
And I began the journey of rediscovering the value of sleep .
And in the course of that , I studied , I met with medical doctors , scientists , and I &apos;m here to tell you that the way to a more productive , more inspired , more joyful life is getting enough sleep .
And we women are going to lead the way in this new revolution , this new feminist issue .
We are literally going to sleep our way to the top , literally .
Because unfortunately for men , sleep deprivation has become a virility symbol .
I was recently having dinner with a guy who bragged that he had only gotten four hours sleep the night before .
And I felt like saying to him -- but I didn &apos;t say it -- I felt like saying , &quot; You know what ?
If you had gotten five , this dinner would have been a lot more interesting . &quot;
There is now a kind of sleep deprivation one-upmanship .
Especially here in Washington , if you try to make a breakfast date , and you say , &quot; How about eight o &apos;clock ? &quot;
they &apos;re likely to tell you , &quot; Eight o &apos;clock is too late for me , but that &apos;s okay , I can get a game of tennis in and do a few conference calls and meet you at eight . &quot;
And they think that means that they are so incredibly busy and productive , but the truth is they &apos;re not , because we , at the moment , have had brilliant leaders in business , in finance , in politics , making terrible decisions .
So a high I.Q.
does not mean that you &apos;re a good leader , because the essence of leadership is being able to see the iceberg before it hits the Titanic .
And we &apos;ve had far too many icebergs hitting our Titanics .
In fact , I have a feeling that if Lehman Brothers was Lehman Brothers and Sisters , they might still be around .
While all the brothers were busy just being hyper-connected 24 / 7 , maybe a sister would have noticed the iceberg , because she would have woken up from a seven-and-a-half- or eight-hour sleep and have been able to see the big picture .
So as we are facing all the multiple crises in our world at the moment , what is good for us on a personal level , what &apos;s going to bring more joy , gratitude , effectiveness in our lives and be the best for our own careers is also what is best for the world .
So I urge you to shut your eyes and discover the great ideas that lie inside us , to shut your engines and discover the power of sleep .
Thank you .

&lt; url &gt; http : / / www.ted.com / talks / chimamanda _ adichie _ the _ danger _ of _ a _ single _ story.html &lt; / url &gt;
I &apos;m a storyteller .
And I would like to tell you a few personal stories about what I like to call &quot; the danger of the single story . &quot;
I grew up on a university campus in eastern Nigeria .
My mother says that I started reading at the age of two , although I think four is probably close to the truth .
So I was an early reader , and what I read were British and American children &apos;s books .
I was also an early writer , and when I began to write , at about the age of seven , stories in pencil with crayon illustrations that my poor mother was obligated to read , I wrote exactly the kinds of stories I was reading : All my characters were white and blue-eyed , they played in the snow , they ate apples , how lovely it was that the sun had come out .
Now , this despite the fact that I lived in Nigeria .
I had never been outside Nigeria .
We didn &apos;t have snow , we ate mangoes , and we never talked about the weather , because there was no need to .
My characters also drank a lot of ginger beer because the characters in the British books I read drank ginger beer .
Never mind that I had no idea what ginger beer was .
And for many years afterwards , I would have a desperate desire to taste ginger beer .
But that is another story .
What this demonstrates , I think , is how impressionable and vulnerable we are in the face of a story , particularly as children .
Because all I had read were books in which characters were foreign , I had become convinced that books by their very nature had to have foreigners in them and had to be about things with which I could not personally identify .
Things changed when I discovered African books .
There weren &apos;t many of them available , and they weren &apos;t quite as easy to find as the foreign books .
But because of writers like Chinua Achebe and Camara Laye I went through a mental shift in my perception of literature .
I realized that people like me , girls with skin the color of chocolate , whose kinky hair could not form ponytails , could also exist in literature .
I started to write about things I recognized .
Now , I loved those American and British books I read .
They stirred my imagination . They opened up new worlds for me .
But the unintended consequence was that I did not know that people like me could exist in literature .
So what the discovery of African writers did for me was this : It saved me from having a single story of what books are .
I come from a conventional , middle-class Nigerian family .
My father was a professor .
My mother was an administrator .
And so we had , as was the norm , live-in domestic help , who would often come from nearby rural villages .
So the year I turned eight we got a new house boy .
His name was Fide .
The only thing my mother told us about him was that his family was very poor .
My mother sent yams and rice , and our old clothes , to his family .
And when I didn &apos;t finish my dinner my mother would say , &quot; Finish your food ! Don &apos;t you know ? People like Fide &apos;s family have nothing . &quot;
So I felt enormous pity for Fide &apos;s family .
Then one Saturday we went to his village to visit , and his mother showed us a beautifully patterned basket made of dyed raffia that his brother had made .
I was startled .
It had not occurred to me that anybody in his family could actually make something .
All I had heard about them was how poor they were , so that it had become impossible for me to see them as anything else but poor .
Their poverty was my single story of them .
Years later , I thought about this when I left Nigeria to go to university in the United States .
I was 19 .
My American roommate was shocked by me .
She asked where I had learned to speak English so well , and was confused when I said that Nigeria happened to have English as its official language .
She asked if she could listen to what she called my &quot; tribal music , &quot; and was consequently very disappointed when I produced my tape of Mariah Carey .
She assumed that I did not know how to use a stove .
What struck me was this : She had felt sorry for me even before she saw me .
Her default position toward me , as an African , was a kind of patronizing , well-meaning pity .
My roommate had a single story of Africa : a single story of catastrophe .
In this single story there was no possibility of Africans being similar to her in any way , no possibility of feelings more complex than pity , no possibility of a connection as human equals .
I must say that before I went to the U.S. I didn &apos;t consciously identify as African .
But in the U.S. whenever Africa came up people turned to me .
Never mind that I knew nothing about places like Namibia .
But I did come to embrace this new identity , and in many ways I think of myself now as African .
Although I still get quite irritable when Africa is referred to as a country , the most recent example being my otherwise wonderful flight from Lagos two days ago , in which there was an announcement on the Virgin flight about the charity work in &quot; India , Africa and other countries . &quot;
So after I had spent some years in the U.S. as an African , I began to understand my roommate &apos;s response to me .
If I had not grown up in Nigeria , and if all I knew about Africa were from popular images , I too would think that Africa was a place of beautiful landscapes , beautiful animals , and incomprehensible people , fighting senseless wars , dying of poverty and AIDS , unable to speak for themselves and waiting to be saved by a kind , white foreigner .
I would see Africans in the same way that I , as a child , had seen Fide &apos;s family .
This single story of Africa ultimately comes , I think , from Western literature .
Now , here is a quote from the writing of a London merchant called John Locke , who sailed to west Africa in 1561 and kept a fascinating account of his voyage .
After referring to the black Africans as &quot; beasts who have no houses , &quot; he writes , &quot; They are also people without heads , having their mouth and eyes in their breasts . &quot;
Now , I &apos;ve laughed every time I &apos;ve read this .
And one must admire the imagination of John Locke .
But what is important about his writing is that it represents the beginning of a tradition of telling African stories in the West : A tradition of Sub-Saharan Africa as a place of negatives , of difference , of darkness , of people who , in the words of the wonderful poet Rudyard Kipling , are &quot; half devil , half child . &quot;
And so I began to realize that my American roommate must have throughout her life seen and heard different versions of this single story , as had a professor , who once told me that my novel was not &quot; authentically African . &quot;
Now , I was quite willing to contend that there were a number of things wrong with the novel , that it had failed in a number of places , but I had not quite imagined that it had failed at achieving something called African authenticity .
In fact I did not know what African authenticity was .
The professor told me that my characters were too much like him , an educated and middle-class man .
My characters drove cars .
They were not starving .
Therefore they were not authentically African .
But I must quickly add that I too am just as guilty in the question of the single story .
A few years ago , I visited Mexico from the U.S.
The political climate in the U.S. at the time was tense , and there were debates going on about immigration .
And , as often happens in America , immigration became synonymous with Mexicans .
There were endless stories of Mexicans as people who were fleecing the healthcare system , sneaking across the border , being arrested at the border , that sort of thing .
I remember walking around on my first day in Guadalajara , watching the people going to work , rolling up tortillas in the marketplace , smoking , laughing .
I remember first feeling slight surprise .
And then I was overwhelmed with shame .
I realized that I had been so immersed in the media coverage of Mexicans that they had become one thing in my mind , the abject immigrant .
I had bought into the single story of Mexicans and I could not have been more ashamed of myself .
So that is how to create a single story , show a people as one thing , as only one thing , over and over again , and that is what they become .
It is impossible to talk about the single story without talking about power .
There is a word , an Igbo word , that I think about whenever I think about the power structures of the world , and it is &quot; nkali . &quot;
It &apos;s a noun that loosely translates to &quot; to be greater than another . &quot;
Like our economic and political worlds , stories too are defined by the principle of nkali : How they are told , who tells them , when they &apos;re told , how many stories are told , are really dependent on power .
Power is the ability not just to tell the story of another person , but to make it the definitive story of that person .
The Palestinian poet Mourid Barghouti writes that if you want to dispossess a people , the simplest way to do it is to tell their story and to start with , &quot; secondly . &quot;
Start the story with the arrows of the Native Americans , and not with the arrival of the British , and you have an entirely different story .
Start the story with the failure of the African state , and not with the colonial creation of the African state , and you have an entirely different story .
I recently spoke at a university where a student told me that it was such a shame that Nigerian men were physical abusers like the father character in my novel .
I told him that I had just read a novel called American Psycho -- -- and that it was such a shame that young Americans were serial murderers .
Now , obviously I said this in a fit of mild irritation .
But it would never have occurred to me to think that just because I had read a novel in which a character was a serial killer that he was somehow representative of all Americans .
This is not because I am a better person than that student , but because of America &apos;s cultural and economic power , I had many stories of America .
I had read Tyler and Updike and Steinbeck and Gaitskill .
I did not have a single story of America .
When I learned , some years ago , that writers were expected to have had really unhappy childhoods to be successful , I began to think about how I could invent horrible things my parents had done to me .
But the truth is that I had a very happy childhood , full of laughter and love , in a very close-knit family .
But I also had grandfathers who died in refugee camps .
My cousin Polle died because he could not get adequate healthcare .
One of my closest friends , Okoloma , died in a plane crash because our fire trucks did not have water .
I grew up under repressive military governments that devalued education , so that sometimes my parents were not paid their salaries .
And so , as a child , I saw jam disappear from the breakfast table , then margarine disappeared , then bread became too expensive , then milk became rationed .
And most of all , a kind of normalized political fear invaded our lives .
All of these stories make me who I am .
But to insist on only these negative stories is to flatten my experience and to overlook the many other stories that formed me .
The single story creates stereotypes , and the problem with stereotypes is not that they are untrue , but that they are incomplete .
They make one story become the only story .
Of course , Africa is a continent full of catastrophes : There are immense ones , such as the horrific rapes in Congo and depressing ones , such as the fact that 5,000 people apply for one job vacancy in Nigeria .
But there are other stories that are not about catastrophe , and it is very important , it is just as important , to talk about them .
I &apos;ve always felt that it is impossible to engage properly with a place or a person without engaging with all of the stories of that place and that person .
The consequence of the single story is this : It robs people of dignity .
It makes our recognition of our equal humanity difficult .
It emphasizes how we are different rather than how we are similar .
So what if before my Mexican trip I had followed the immigration debate from both sides , the U.S. and the Mexican ?
What if my mother had told us that Fide &apos;s family was poor and hardworking ?
What if we had an African television network that broadcast diverse African stories all over the world ?
What the Nigerian writer Chinua Achebe calls &quot; a balance of stories . &quot;
What if my roommate knew about my Nigerian publisher , Mukta Bakaray , a remarkable man who left his job in a bank to follow his dream and start a publishing house ?
Now , the conventional wisdom was that Nigerians don &apos;t read literature .
He disagreed . He felt that people who could read , would read , if you made literature affordable and available to them .
Shortly after he published my first novel I went to a TV station in Lagos to do an interview , and a woman who worked there as a messenger came up to me and said , &quot; I really liked your novel . I didn &apos;t like the ending .
Now you must write a sequel , and this is what will happen ... &quot;
And she went on to tell me what to write in the sequel .
I was not only charmed , I was very moved .
Here was a woman , part of the ordinary masses of Nigerians , who were not supposed to be readers .
She had not only read the book , but she had taken ownership of it and felt justified in telling me what to write in the sequel .
Now , what if my roommate knew about my friend Fumi Onda , a fearless woman who hosts a TV show in Lagos , and is determined to tell the stories that we prefer to forget ?
What if my roommate knew about the heart procedure that was performed in the Lagos hospital last week ?
What if my roommate knew about contemporary Nigerian music , talented people singing in English and Pidgin , and Igbo and Yoruba and Ijo , mixing influences from Jay-Z to Fela to Bob Marley to their grandfathers .
What if my roommate knew about the female lawyer who recently went to court in Nigeria to challenge a ridiculous law that required women to get their husband &apos;s consent before renewing their passports ?
What if my roommate knew about Nollywood , full of innovative people making films despite great technical odds , films so popular that they really are the best example of Nigerians consuming what they produce ?
What if my roommate knew about my wonderfully ambitious hair braider , who has just started her own business selling hair extensions ?
Or about the millions of other Nigerians who start businesses and sometimes fail , but continue to nurse ambition ?
Every time I am home I am confronted with the usual sources of irritation for most Nigerians : our failed infrastructure , our failed government , but also by the incredible resilience of people who thrive despite the government , rather than because of it .
I teach writing workshops in Lagos every summer , and it is amazing to me how many people apply , how many people are eager to write , to tell stories .
My Nigerian publisher and I have just started a non-profit called Farafina Trust , and we have big dreams of building libraries and refurbishing libraries that already exist and providing books for state schools that don &apos;t have anything in their libraries , and also of organizing lots and lots of workshops , in reading and writing , for all the people who are eager to tell our many stories .
Stories matter .
Many stories matter .
Stories have been used to dispossess and to malign , but stories can also be used to empower and to humanize .
Stories can break the dignity of a people , but stories can also repair that broken dignity .
The American writer Alice Walker wrote this about her Southern relatives who had moved to the North .
She introduced them to a book about the Southern life that they had left behind : &quot; They sat around , reading the book themselves , listening to me read the book , and a kind of paradise was regained . &quot;
I would like to end with this thought : That when we reject the single story , when we realize that there is never a single story about any place , we regain a kind of paradise .
Thank you .

Good morning . How are you ? It &apos;s been great , hasn &apos;t it ?
I &apos;ve been blown away by the whole thing .
In fact , I &apos;m leaving .
There have been three themes , haven &apos;t there , running through the conference , which are relevant to what I want to talk about .
One is the extraordinary evidence of human creativity in all of the presentations that we &apos;ve had and in all of the people here . Just the variety of it and the range of it . The second is that it &apos;s put us in a place where we have no idea what &apos;s going to happen , in terms of the future . No idea how this may play out .
I have an interest in education -- actually , what I find is everybody has an interest in education .
Don &apos;t you ? I find this very interesting .
If you &apos;re at a dinner party , and you say you work in education -- actually , you &apos;re not often at dinner parties , frankly , if you work in education .
You &apos;re not asked .
And you &apos;re never asked back , curiously . That &apos;s strange to me .
But if you are , and you say to somebody , you know , they say , &quot; What do you do ? &quot;
and you say you work in education , you can see the blood run from their face . They &apos;re like , &quot; Oh my God , &quot; you know , &quot; Why me ? My one night out all week . &quot;
But if you ask about their education , they pin you to the wall . Because it &apos;s one of those things that goes deep with people , am I right ?
Like religion , and money and other things .
I have a big interest in education , and I think we all do .
We have a huge vested interest in it , partly because it &apos;s education that &apos;s meant to take us into this future that we can &apos;t grasp .
If you think of it , children starting school this year will be retiring in 2065 . Nobody has a clue -- despite all the expertise that &apos;s been on parade for the past four days -- what the world will look like in five years &apos; time . And yet we &apos;re meant to be educating them for it . So the unpredictability , I think , is extraordinary .
And the third part of this is that we &apos;ve all agreed , nonetheless , on the really extraordinary capacities that children have -- their capacities for innovation . I mean , Sirena last night was a marvel , wasn &apos;t she ? Just seeing what she could do .
And she &apos;s exceptional , but I think she &apos;s not , so to speak , exceptional in the whole of childhood .
What you have there is a person of extraordinary dedication who found a talent . And my contention is , all kids have tremendous talents .
And we squander them , pretty ruthlessly .
So I want to talk about education and I want to talk about creativity . My contention is that creativity now is as important in education as literacy , and we should treat it with the same status .
Thank you . That was it , by the way .
Thank you very much . So , 15 minutes left .
Well , I was born ... no .
I heard a great story recently -- I love telling it -- of a little girl who was in a drawing lesson . She was six and she was at the back , drawing , and the teacher said this little girl hardly ever paid attention , and in this drawing lesson she did .
The teacher was fascinated and she went over to her and she said , &quot; What are you drawing ? &quot;
And the girl said , &quot; I &apos;m drawing a picture of God . &quot;
And the teacher said , &quot; But nobody knows what God looks like . &quot;
And the girl said , &quot; They will in a minute . &quot;
When my son was four in England -- actually he was four everywhere , to be honest .
If we &apos;re being strict about it , wherever he went , he was four that year .
He was in the Nativity play .
Do you remember the story ? No , it was big .
It was a big story . Mel Gibson did the sequel .
You may have seen it : &quot; Nativity II . &quot; But James got the part of Joseph , which we were thrilled about .
We considered this to be one of the lead parts .
We had the place crammed full of agents in T-shirts : &quot; James Robinson IS Joseph ! &quot;
He didn &apos;t have to speak , but you know the bit where the three kings come in . They come in bearing gifts , and they bring gold , frankincense and myrhh .
This really happened . We were sitting there and I think they just went out of sequence , because we talked to the little boy afterward and we said , &quot; You OK with that ? &quot; And he said , &quot; Yeah , why ? Was that wrong ? &quot;
They just switched , that was it .
Anyway , the three boys came in -- four-year-olds with tea towels on their heads -- and they put these boxes down , and the first boy said , &quot; I bring you gold . &quot;
And the second boy said , &quot; I bring you myrhh . &quot;
And the third boy said , &quot; Frank sent this . &quot;
What these things have in common is that kids will take a chance .
If they don &apos;t know , they &apos;ll have a go .
Am I right ? They &apos;re not frightened of being wrong .
Now , I don &apos;t mean to say that being wrong is the same thing as being creative .
What we do know is , if you &apos;re not prepared to be wrong , you &apos;ll never come up with anything original -- if you &apos;re not prepared to be wrong . And by the time they get to be adults , most kids have lost that capacity .
They have become frightened of being wrong .
And we run our companies like this , by the way .
We stigmatize mistakes . And we &apos;re now running national education systems where mistakes are the worst thing you can make .
And the result is that we are educating people out of their creative capacities . Picasso once said this -- he said that all children are born artists .
The problem is to remain an artist as we grow up . I believe this passionately , that we don &apos;t grow into creativity , we grow out of it . Or rather , we get educated out if it .
So why is this ?
I lived in Stratford-on-Avon until about five years ago .
In fact , we moved from Stratford to Los Angeles .
So you can imagine what a seamless transition that was .
Actually , we lived in a place called Snitterfield , just outside Stratford , which is where Shakespeare &apos;s father was born . Are you struck by a new thought ? I was .
You don &apos;t think of Shakespeare having a father , do you ?
Do you ? Because you don &apos;t think of Shakespeare being a child , do you ?
Shakespeare being seven ? I never thought of it . I mean , he was seven at some point . He was in somebody &apos;s English class , wasn &apos;t he ? How annoying would that be ?
&quot; Must try harder . &quot; Being sent to bed by his dad , you know , to Shakespeare , &quot; Go to bed , now , &quot; to William Shakespeare , &quot; and put the pencil down .
And stop speaking like that . It &apos;s confusing everybody . &quot;
Anyway , we moved from Stratford to Los Angeles , and I just want to say a word about the transition , actually .
My son didn &apos;t want to come .
I &apos;ve got two kids . He &apos;s 21 now ; my daughter &apos;s 16 .
He didn &apos;t want to come to Los Angeles . He loved it , but he had a girlfriend in England . This was the love of his life , Sarah .
He &apos;d known her for a month .
Mind you , they &apos;d had their fourth anniversary , because it &apos;s a long time when you &apos;re 16 .
Anyway , he was really upset on the plane , and he said , &quot; I &apos;ll never find another girl like Sarah . &quot;
And we were rather pleased about that , frankly , because she was the main reason we were leaving the country .
But something strikes you when you move to America and when you travel around the world : Every education system on earth has the same hierarchy of subjects .
Every one . Doesn &apos;t matter where you go .
You &apos;d think it would be otherwise , but it isn &apos;t .
At the top are mathematics and languages , then the humanities , and the bottom are the arts .
Everywhere on Earth .
And in pretty much every system too , there &apos;s a hierarchy within the arts .
Art and music are normally given a higher status in schools than drama and dance . There isn &apos;t an education system on the planet that teaches dance everyday to children the way we teach them mathematics . Why ?
Why not ? I think this is rather important .
I think math is very important , but so is dance .
Children dance all the time if they &apos;re allowed to , we all do .
We all have bodies , don &apos;t we ? Did I miss a meeting ?
Truthfully , what happens is , as children grow up , we start to educate them progressively from the waist up . And then we focus on their heads .
And slightly to one side .
If you were to visit education , as an alien , and say &quot; What &apos;s it for , public education ? &quot;
I think you &apos;d have to conclude -- if you look at the output , who really succeeds by this , who does everything that they should , who gets all the brownie points , who are the winners -- I think you &apos;d have to conclude the whole purpose of public education throughout the world is to produce university professors . Isn &apos;t it ?
They &apos;re the people who come out the top .
And I used to be one , so there .
And I like university professors , but you know , we shouldn &apos;t hold them up as the high-water mark of all human achievement .
They &apos;re just a form of life , another form of life . But they &apos;re rather curious , and I say this out of affection for them .
There &apos;s something curious about professors in my experience -- not all of them , but typically -- they live in their heads .
They live up there , and slightly to one side .
They &apos;re disembodied , you know , in a kind of literal way .
They look upon their body as a form of transport for their heads , don &apos;t they ?
It &apos;s a way of getting their head to meetings .
If you want real evidence of out-of-body experiences , by the way , get yourself along to a residential conference of senior academics , and pop into the discotheque on the final night .
And there you will see it -- grown men and women writhing uncontrollably , off the beat , waiting until it ends so they can go home and write a paper about it .
Now our education system is predicated on the idea of academic ability .
And there &apos;s a reason .
The whole system was invented -- around the world , there were no public systems of education , really , before the 19th century .
They all came into being to meet the needs of industrialism .
So the hierarchy is rooted on two ideas .
Number one , that the most useful subjects for work are at the top . So you were probably steered benignly away from things at school when you were a kid , things you liked , on the grounds that you would never get a job doing that . Is that right ?
Don &apos;t do music , you &apos;re not going to be a musician ; don &apos;t do art , you won &apos;t be an artist .
Benign advice -- now , profoundly mistaken . The whole world is engulfed in a revolution .
And the second is academic ability , which has really come to dominate our view of intelligence , because the universities designed the system in their image .
If you think of it , the whole system of public education around the world is a protracted process of university entrance .
And the consequence is that many highly talented , brilliant , creative people think they &apos;re not , because the thing they were good at at school wasn &apos;t valued , or was actually stigmatized .
And I think we can &apos;t afford to go on that way .
In the next 30 years , according to UNESCO , more people worldwide will be graduating through education than since the beginning of history .
More people , and it &apos;s the combination of all the things we &apos;ve talked about -- technology and its transformation effect on work , and demography and the huge explosion in population .
Suddenly , degrees aren &apos;t worth anything . Isn &apos;t that true ?
When I was a student , if you had a degree , you had a job .
If you didn &apos;t have a job it &apos;s because you didn &apos;t want one .
And I didn &apos;t want one , frankly .
But now kids with degrees are often heading home to carry on playing video games , because you need an MA where the previous job required a BA , and now you need a PhD for the other .
It &apos;s a process of academic inflation .
And it indicates the whole structure of education is shifting beneath our feet . We need to radically rethink our view of intelligence .
We know three things about intelligence .
One , it &apos;s diverse . We think about the world in all the ways that we experience it . We think visually , we think in sound , we think kinesthetically .
We think in abstract terms , we think in movement .
Secondly , intelligence is dynamic .
If you look at the interactions of a human brain , as we heard yesterday from a number of presentations , intelligence is wonderfully interactive .
The brain isn &apos;t divided into compartments .
In fact , creativity -- which I define as the process of having original ideas that have value -- more often than not comes about through the interaction of different disciplinary ways of seeing things .
The brain is intentionally -- by the way , there &apos;s a shaft of nerves that joins the two halves of the brain called the corpus callosum . It &apos;s thicker in women .
Following off from Helen yesterday , I think this is probably why women are better at multi-tasking .
Because you are , aren &apos;t you ?
There &apos;s a raft of research , but I know it from my personal life .
If my wife is cooking a meal at home -- which is not often , thankfully .
But you know , she &apos;s doing -- no , she &apos;s good at some things -- but if she &apos;s cooking , you know , she &apos;s dealing with people on the phone , she &apos;s talking to the kids , she &apos;s painting the ceiling , she &apos;s doing open-heart surgery over here .
If I &apos;m cooking , the door is shut , the kids are out , the phone &apos;s on the hook , if she comes in I get annoyed .
I say , &quot; Terry , please , I &apos;m trying to fry an egg in here . Give me a break . &quot;
Actually , you know that old philosophical thing , if a tree falls in a forest and nobody hears it , did it happen ? Remember that old chestnut ?
I saw a great t-shirt really recently which said , &quot; If a man speaks his mind in a forest , and no woman hears him , is he still wrong ? &quot;
And the third thing about intelligence is , it &apos;s distinct . I &apos;m doing a new book at the moment called &quot; Epiphany , &quot; which is based on a series of interviews with people about how they discovered their talent . I &apos;m fascinated by how people got to be there .
It &apos;s really prompted by a conversation I had with a wonderful woman who maybe most people have never heard of ; she &apos;s called Gillian Lynne -- have you heard of her ? Some have . She &apos;s a choreographer and everybody knows her work .
She did &quot; Cats &quot; and &quot; Phantom of the Opera . &quot;
She &apos;s wonderful . I used to be on the board of the Royal Ballet in England , as you can see .
Anyway , Gillian and I had lunch one day and I said , &quot; Gillian , how &apos;d you get to be a dancer ? &quot; And she said it was interesting ; when she was at school , she was really hopeless . And the school , in the &apos; 30s , wrote to her parents and said , &quot; We think Gillian has a learning disorder . &quot; She couldn &apos;t concentrate ; she was fidgeting . I think now they &apos;d say she had ADHD . Wouldn &apos;t you ? But this was the 1930s , and ADHD hadn &apos;t been invented at this point .
It wasn &apos;t an available condition .
People weren &apos;t aware they could have that .
Anyway , she went to see this specialist . So , this oak-paneled room , and she was there with her mother , and she was led and sat on this chair at the end , and she sat on her hands for 20 minutes while this man talked to her mother about all the problems Gillian was having at school . And at the end of it -- because she was disturbing people ; her homework was always late ; and so on , little kid of eight -- in the end , the doctor went and sat next to Gillian and said , &quot; Gillian , I &apos;ve listened to all these things that your mother &apos;s told me , and I need to speak to her privately . &quot;
He said , &quot; Wait here . We &apos;ll be back ; we won &apos;t be very long , &quot; and they went and left her .
But as they went out the room , he turned on the radio that was sitting on his desk . And when they got out the room , he said to her mother , &quot; Just stand and watch her . &quot; And the minute they left the room , she said , she was on her feet , moving to the music .
And they watched for a few minutes and he turned to her mother and said , &quot; Mrs. Lynne , Gillian isn &apos;t sick ; she &apos;s a dancer .
Take her to a dance school . &quot;
I said , &quot; What happened ? &quot;
She said , &quot; She did . I can &apos;t tell you how wonderful it was .
We walked in this room and it was full of people like me . People who couldn &apos;t sit still .
People who had to move to think . &quot; Who had to move to think .
They did ballet ; they did tap ; they did jazz ; they did modern ; they did contemporary .
She was eventually auditioned for the Royal Ballet School ; she became a soloist ; she had a wonderful career at the Royal Ballet . She eventually graduated from the Royal Ballet School and founded her own company -- the Gillian Lynne Dance Company -- met Andrew Lloyd Weber . She &apos;s been responsible for some of the most successful musical theater productions in history ; she &apos;s given pleasure to millions ; and she &apos;s a multi-millionaire . Somebody else might have put her on medication and told her to calm down .
Now , I think ... What I think it comes to is this : Al Gore spoke the other night about ecology and the revolution that was triggered by Rachel Carson .
I believe our only hope for the future is to adopt a new conception of human ecology , one in which we start to reconstitute our conception of the richness of human capacity .
Our education system has mined our minds in the way that we strip-mine the earth : for a particular commodity .
And for the future , it won &apos;t serve us .
We have to rethink the fundamental principles on which we &apos;re educating our children . There was a wonderful quote by Jonas Salk , who said , &quot; If all the insects were to disappear from the earth , within 50 years all life on Earth would end .
If all human beings disappeared from the earth , within 50 years all forms of life would flourish . &quot;
And he &apos;s right .
What TED celebrates is the gift of the human imagination .
We have to be careful now that we use this gift wisely and that we avert some of the scenarios that we &apos;ve talked about . And the only way we &apos;ll do it is by seeing our creative capacities for the richness they are and seeing our children for the hope that they are . And our task is to educate their whole being , so they can face this future .
By the way -- we may not see this future , but they will . And our job is to help them make something of it . Thank you very much .

Thank you .
Imagining a solo cello concert , one would most likely think of Johann Sebastian Bach unaccompanied cello suites .
As a child studying these eternal masterpieces , Bach &apos;s music would intermingle with the singing voices of Muslim prayers from the neighboring Arab village of the northern Kibbutz in Israel where I grew up .
Late at night , after hours of practicing , I would listen to Janis Joplin and Billie Holiday as the sounds of tango music would be creeping from my parents &apos; stereo .
It all became music to me .
I didn &apos;t hear the boundaries .
I still start every day practicing playing Bach .
His music never ceases to sound fresh and surprising to me .
But as I was moving away from the traditional classical repertoire and trying to find new ways of musical expression , I realized that with today &apos;s technological resources , there &apos;s no reason to limit what can be produced at one time from a single string instrument .
The power and coherency that comes from one person hearing , perceiving and playing all the voices makes a very different experience .
The excitement of a great orchestra performance comes from the attempt to have a collective of musicians producing one unified whole concept .
The excitement from using multi-tracking , the way I did in the piece you will hear next , comes from the attempt to build and create a whole universe with many diverse layers , all generated from a single source .
My cello and my voice are layered to create this large sonic canvas .
When composers write music for me , I ask them to forget what they know about the cello .
I hope to arrive at new territories to discover sounds I have never heard before .
I want to create endless possibilities with this cello .
I become the medium through which the music is being channeled , and in the process , when all is right , the music is transformed and so am I.

So , as researchers , something that we often do is use immense resources to achieve certain capabilities , or achieve certain goals .
And this is essential to the progress of science , or exploration of what is possible .
But it sort of creates this unfortunate situation where a tiny , tiny fraction of the world can actually participate in this exploration or can benefit from that technology .
And something that motivates me , and what gets me really excited about my research , is when I see simple opportunities to drastically change that distribution and make the technology accessible to a much wider percentage of the population .
And I &apos;m going to show you two videos that have gotten a lot of attention recently that I think embody this philosophy .
And they actually use the Nintendo Wii remote .
Now , for those of you who aren &apos;t familiar with this device , it &apos;s a $ 40 video game controller .
And it &apos;s mostly advertised for its motion sensor capabilities : so you can swing a tennis racket , or hit a baseball bat .
But what actually interests me a lot more is the fact that in the tip of each controller is a relatively high-performing infrared camera .
And I &apos;m going to show you two demos of why this is useful .
So here , I have my computer set up with the projector , and I have a Wii remote sitting on top of it .
And , for example , if you &apos;re in a school that doesn &apos;t have a lot money , which is probably a lot of schools , or if you &apos;re in an office environment , and you want an interactive whiteboard , normally these cost about two to three thousand dollars .
So what I &apos;m going to show you how to do is how to create one with a Wii remote .
Now , this requires another piece of hardware , which is this infrared pen .
You can probably make this yourself for about five dollars with a quick trip to the Radio Shack .
It &apos;s essentially got a battery , a button and an infrared LED , and it turns on -- you guys can &apos;t see it -- but it turns on whenever I push the button .
Now , what this means is that if I run this piece of software , the camera sees the infrared dot , and I can register the location of the camera pixels to the projector pixels . And now this is like a whiteboard surface .
So for about $ 50 of hardware , you can have your own whiteboard .
This is Adobe Photoshop .
Thank you .
Now , the software for this I &apos;ve actually put on my website and have let people download it for free .
And in the three months that this project has been public , it &apos;s been downloaded over half a million times .
So teachers and students all around the world are already using this .
I want to quickly say that although it does do it for 50 dollars , there are some limitations of this approach .
But you get about 80 percent of the way there , for about one percent of the cost .
Another nice thing is that a camera can see multiple dots , so this is actually a multi-touch , interactive whiteboard system as well .
For the second demo , I have this Wii remote that &apos;s actually next to the TV .
So it &apos;s pointing away from the display , rather than pointing at the display .
And why this is interesting is that if you put on , say , a pair of safety glasses , that have two infrared dots in them , is , give the computer an approximation of your head location .
And why this is interesting is I have this sort of application running on the computer monitor , which has a 3D room , with some targets floating in it .
And you can see that it looks like a 3D room -- if you can see -- kind of like a video game , it sort of looks 3D , but for the most part , the image looks pretty flat , and bound to the surface of the screen .
But if we turn on head tracking , the computer can change the image that &apos;s on the screen and make it respond to the head movements .
So let &apos;s switch back to that .
So this has actually been a little bit startling to the game development community .
Because this is about 10 dollars of additional hardware if you already have a Nintendo Wii .
So I &apos;m looking forward to seeing some games , and actually Louis Castle , that &apos;s him down there , last week announced that Electronic Arts , one of the largest game publishers , is releasing a game in May that has a little Easter egg feature for supporting this type of head tracking .
So -- and that &apos;s from less than five months from a prototype in my lab to a major commercial product .
Thank you .
But actually , to me , what &apos;s almost more interesting than either of these two products is how people actually found out about them .
YouTube has really changed the way , or changed the speed , in which a single individual can actually spread an idea around the world .
You know , I &apos;m doing some research in my lab with a video camera , and within the first week , a million people had seen this work , and literally within days , engineers , teachers and students from around the world , were already posting their own YouTube videos of them using my system or derivatives of this work .
So I hope to see more of that in the future , and hope online video distribution to be embraced by the research community .
So thank you very much .

The stories we tell about each other matter very much .
The stories we tell ourselves about our own lives matter .
And most of all , I think the way that we participate in each other &apos;s stories is of deep importance .
I was six years old when I first heard stories about the poor .
Now I didn &apos;t hear those stories from the poor themselves , I heard them from my Sunday school teacher and Jesus , kind of via my Sunday school teacher .
I remember learning that people who were poor needed something material -- food , clothing , shelter -- that they didn &apos;t have .
And I also was taught , coupled with that , that it was my job -- this classroom full of five and six year-old children -- it was our job , apparently , to help .
This is what Jesus asked of us .
And then he said , &quot; What you do for the least of these , you do for me . &quot;
Now I was pretty psyched .
I was very eager to be useful in the world -- I think we all have that feeling .
And also , it was kind of interesting that God needed help .
That was news to me , and it felt like it was a very important thing to get to participate in .
But I also learned very soon thereafter that Jesus also said , and I &apos;m paraphrasing , the poor would always be with us .
This frustrated and confused me ; I felt like I had been just given a homework assignment that I had to do , and I was excited to do , but no matter what I would do , I would fail .
So I felt confused , a little bit frustrated and angry , like maybe I &apos;d misunderstood something here .
And I felt overwhelmed .
And for the first time , I began to fear this group of people and to feel negative emotion towards a whole group of people .
I imagined in my head , a kind of long line of individuals that were never going away , that would always be with us .
They were always going to ask me to help them and give them things , which I was excited to do , but I didn &apos;t know how it was going to work .
And I didn &apos;t know what would happen when I ran out of things to give , especially if the problem was never going away .
In the years following , the other stories I heard about the poor growing up were no more positive .
For example , I saw pictures and images frequently of sadness and suffering .
I heard about things that were going wrong in the lives of the poor .
I heard about disease , I heard about war -- they always seemed to be kind of related .
And in general , I got this sort of idea that the poor in the world lived lives that were wrought with suffering and sadness , devastation , hopelessness .
And after a while , I developed what I think many of us do , is this predictable response , where I started to feel bad every time I heard about them .
I started to feel guilty for my own relative wealth , because I wasn &apos;t doing more , apparently , to make things better .
And I even felt a sense of shame because of that .
And so naturally , I started to distance myself .
I stopped listening to their stories quite as closely as I had before .
And I stopped expecting things to really change .
Now I still gave -- on the outside it looked like I was still quite involved .
I gave of my time and my money , I gave when solutions were on sale .
The cost of a cup of coffee can save a child &apos;s life , right .
I mean who can argue with that ?
I gave when I was cornered , when it was difficult to avoid and I gave , in general , when the negative emotions built up enough that I gave to relieve my own suffering , not someone else &apos;s .
The truth be told , I was giving out of that place , not out of a genuine place of hope and excitement to help and of generosity .
It became a transaction for me , became sort of a trade .
I was purchasing something -- I was buying my right to go on with my day and not necessarily be bothered by this bad news .
And I think the way that we go through that sometimes can , first of all , disembody a group of people , individuals out there in the world .
And it can also turn into a commodity , which is a very scary thing .
So as I did this , and as I think many of us do this , we kind of buy our distance , we kind of buy our right to go on with our day .
I think that exchange can actually get in the way of the very thing that we want most .
It can get in the way of our desire to really be meaningful and useful in another person &apos;s life and , in short to love .
Thankfully , a few years ago , things shifted for me because I heard this gentleman speak , Dr. Muhammad Yunus .
I know many in the room probably know exactly who he is , but to give the shorthand version for any who have not heard him speak , Dr. Yunus won the Nobel Peace Prize a few years ago for his work pioneering modern microfinance .
When I heard him speak , it was three years before that .
But basically , microfinance -- if this is new to you as well -- think of that as financial services for the poor .
Think of all the things you get at your bank and imagine those products and services tailored to the needs of someone living on a few dollars a day .
Dr. Yunus shared his story , explaining what that was , and what he had done with his Grameen Bank .
He also talked about , in particular , microlending , which is a tiny loan that could help someone start or grow a business .
Now , when I heard him speak , it was exciting for a number of reasons .
First and foremost , I learned about this new method of change in the world that , for once , showed me , maybe , a way to interact with someone and to give , to share of a resource in a way that wasn &apos;t weird and didn &apos;t make me feel bad -- that was exciting .
But more importantly , he told stories about the poor that were different than any stories I had heard before .
In fact , those individuals he talked about who were poor was sort of a side note .
He was talking about strong , smart , hardworking entrepreneurs who woke up every day and were doing things to make their lives and their family &apos;s lives better .
All they needed to do that more quickly and to do it better was a little bit of capital .
It was an amazing sort of insight for me .
And I , in fact , was so deeply moved by this -- it &apos;s hard to express now how much that affected me -- but I was so moved that I actually quit my job a few weeks later , and I moved to East Africa to try to see for myself what this was about .
For the first time , actually , in a long time I wanted to meet those individuals , I wanted to meet these entrepreneurs , and see for myself what their lives were actually about .
So I spent three months in Kenya , Uganda and Tanzania interviewing entrepreneurs that had received 100 dollars to start or grow a business .
And in fact , through those interactions , for the first time , I was starting to get to be friends with some of those people in that big amorphous group out there that was supposed to be far away .
I was starting to be friends and get to know their personal stories .
And over and over again , as I interviewed them and spent my days with them , I did hear stories of life change and amazing little details of change .
So I would hear from goat herders who had used that money that they had received to buy a few more goats .
Their business trajectory would change .
They would make a little bit more money ; their standard of living would shift and would get better .
And they would make really interesting little adjustments in their lives , like they would start to send their children to school .
They might be able to buy mosquito nets .
Maybe they could afford a lock for the door and feel secure .
Maybe it was just that they could put sugar in their tea and offer that to me when I came as their guest and that made them feel proud .
But there were these beautiful details , even if I talked to 20 goat herders in a row , and some days that &apos;s what happened -- these beautiful details of life change that were meaningful to them .
That was another thing that really touched me .
It was really humbling to see for the first time , to really understand that even if I could have taken a magic wand and fixed everything , I probably would have gotten a lot wrong .
Because the best way for people to change their lives is for them to have control and to do that in a way that they believe is best for them .
So I saw that and it was very humbling .
Anyway , another interesting thing happened while I was there .
I never once was asked for a donation , which had kind of been my mode , right .
There &apos;s poverty , you give money to help -- no one asked me for a donation .
In fact , no one wanted me to feel bad for them at all .
If anything , they just wanted to be able to do more of what they were doing already and to build on their own capabilities .
So what I did hear , once in a while , was that people wanted a loan -- I thought that sounded very reasonable and really exciting .
And by the way , I was a philosophy and poetry major in school , so I didn &apos;t know the difference between profit and revenue when I went to East Africa .
I just got this impression that the money would work .
And my introduction to business was in these $ 100 little infuses of capital .
And I learned about profit and revenue , about leverage , all sorts of things , from farmers , from seamstresses , from goat herders .
So this idea that these new stories of business and hope might be shared with my friends and family , and through that , maybe we could get some of the money that they needed to be able to continue their businesses as loans , that &apos;s this little idea that turned into Kiva .
A few months later , I went back to Uganda with a digital camera and a basic website that my partner , Matthew , and I had kind of built , and took pictures of seven of my new friends , posted their stories , these stories of entrepreneurship , up on the website , spammed friends and family and said , &quot; We think this is legal .
Haven &apos;t heard back yet from SEC on all the details , but do you say , do you want to help participate in this , provide the money that they need ? &quot;
The money came in basically overnight .
We sent it over to Uganda .
And over the next six months , a beautiful thing happened ; the entrepreneurs received the money , they were paid , and their businesses , in fact , grew , and they were able to support themselves and change the trajectory of their lives .
In October of &apos; 05 , after those first seven loans were paid , Matt and I took the word beta off of the site .
We said , &quot; Our little experiment has been a success .
Let &apos;s start for real . &quot; That was our official launch .
And then that first year , October &apos; 05 through &apos; 06 , Kiva facilitated $ 500,000 in loans .
The second year , it was a total of 15 million .
The third year , the total was up to around 40 .
The fourth year , we were just short of 100 .
And today , less than five years in , Kiva &apos;s facilitated more than 150 million dollars , in little 25-dollar bits , from lenders and entrepreneurs -- more than a million of those , collectively in 200 countries .
So that &apos;s where Kiva is today , just to bring you right up to the present .
And while those numbers and those statistics are really fun to talk about and they &apos;re interesting , to me , Kiva &apos;s really about stories .
It &apos;s about retelling the story of the poor , and it &apos;s about giving ourselves an opportunity to engage that validates their dignity , validates a partnership relationship , not a relationship that &apos;s based on the traditional sort of donor beneficiary weirdness that can happen .
But instead a relationship that can promote respect and hope and this optimism that together we can move forward .
So what I hope is that , not only can the money keep flowing forth through Kiva -- that &apos;s a very positive and meaningful thing -- but I hope Kiva can blur those lines , like I said , between the traditional rich and poor categories that we &apos;re taught to see in the world , this false dichotomy of us and them , have and have not .
I hope that Kiva can blur those lines .
Because as that happens , I think we can feel free to interact in a way that &apos;s more open , more just and more creative , to engage with each other and to help each other .
Imagine how you feel when you see somebody on street who is begging and you &apos;re about to approach them .
Imagine how you feel ; and then imagine the difference when you might see somebody who has a story of entrepreneurship and hard work who wants to tell you about their business .
Maybe they &apos;re smiling , and they want to talk to you about what they &apos;ve done .
Imagine if you &apos;re speaking with somebody who &apos;s growing things and making them flourish , somebody who &apos;s using their talents to do something productive , somebody who &apos;s built their own business from scratch , someone who is surrounded by abundance , not scarcity , who &apos;s in fact creating abundance , somebody with full hands with something to offer , not empty hands asking for you to give them something .
Imagine if you could hear a story you didn &apos;t expect of somebody who wakes up every day and works very , very hard to make their life better .
These stories can really change the way that we think about each other .
And if we can catalyze a supportive community to come around these individuals and to participate in their story by lending a little bit of money , I think that can change the way we believe in each other and each other &apos;s potential .
Now for me , Kiva is just the beginning .
And as I look forward to what is next , it &apos;s been helpful to reflect on the things I &apos;ve learned so far .
The first one is , as I mentioned , entrepreneurship was a new idea to me .
Kiva borrowers , as I interviewed them and got to know them over the last few years , have taught me what entrepreneurship is .
And I think , at its core , it &apos;s deciding that you want your life to be better .
You see an opportunity and you decide what you &apos;re going to do to try to seize that .
In short , it &apos;s deciding that tomorrow can better than today and going after that .
Second thing that I &apos;ve learned is that loans are a very interesting tool for connectivity .
So they &apos;re not a donation .
Yeah , maybe it doesn &apos;t sound that much different .
But in fact , when you give something to someone and they say , &quot; Thanks , &quot; and let you know how things go , that &apos;s one thing .
When you lend them money , and they slowly pay you back over time , you have this excuse to have an ongoing dialogue .
This continued attention -- this ongoing attention -- is a really big deal to build different kinds of relationships among us .
And then third , from what I &apos;ve heard from the entrepreneurs I &apos;ve gotten to know , when all else is equal , given the option to have just money to do what you need to do , or money plus the support and encouragement of a global community , people choose the community plus the money .
That &apos;s a much more meaningful combination , a more powerful combination .
So with that in mind , this particular incident has led to the things that I &apos;m working on now .
I see entrepreneurs everywhere now , now that I &apos;m tuned into this .
And one thing that I &apos;ve seen is there are a lot of supportive communities that already exist in the world .
With social networks , it &apos;s an amazing way , growing the number of people that we all have around us in our own supportive communities , rapidly .
And so , as I have been thinking about this , I &apos;ve been wondering : how can we engage these supportive communities to catalyze even more entrepreneurial ideas and to catalyze all of us to make tomorrow better than today ?
As I &apos;ve researched what &apos;s going on in the United States , a few interesting little insights have come up .
So one is that , of course , as we all might expect , many small businesses in the U.S. and all over the world still need money to grow and to do more of what they want to do or they might need money during a hard month .
But there &apos;s always a need for resources close by .
Another thing is , it turns out , those resources don &apos;t usually come from the places you might expect -- banks , venture capitalists , other organizations and support structures -- they come from friends and family .
Some statistics say 85 percent or more of funding for small businesses comes from friends and family .
That &apos;s around 130 billion dollars a year -- it &apos;s a lot .
And third , so as people are doing this friends and family fundraising process , it &apos;s very awkward , people don &apos;t know exactly what to ask for , how to ask , what to promise in return , even though they have the best of intentions and want to thank those people that are supporting them .
So to harness the power of these supportive communities in a new way and to allow entrepreneurs to decide for themselves exactly what that financial exchange should look like , exactly what fits them and the people around them , this week actually , we &apos;re quietly doing a launch of Profounder , which is a crowd funding platform for small businesses to raise what they need through investments from their friends and family .
And it &apos;s investments , not donations , not loans , but investments that have a dynamic return .
So the mapping of participating in the story , it actually flows with the up and down .
So in short , it &apos;s a do-it-yourself tool for small businesses to raise these funds .
And what you can do is go onto the site , create a profile , create investment terms in a really easy way .
We make it really , really simple for me as well as anyone else who wants to use the site .
And we allow entrepreneurs to share a percentage of their revenues .
They can raise up to a million dollars from an unlimited number of unaccredited , unsophisticated investors -- everyday people , heaven forbid -- and they can share those returns over time -- again , whatever terms they set .
As investors choose to become involved based on those terms , they can either take their rewards back as cash , or they can decide in advance to give those returns away to a non-profit .
So they can be a cash , or a cause , investor .
It &apos;s my hope that this kind of tool can show anybody who has an idea a path to go do what they want to do in the world and to gather the people around them that they already have , the people that know them best and that love them and want to support them , to gather them to make this happen .
So that &apos;s what I &apos;m working on now .
And to close , I just want to say , look these are tools .
Right now , Profounder &apos;s right at the very beginning , and it &apos;s very palpable ; it &apos;s very clear to me , that it &apos;s just a vessel , it &apos;s just a tool .
What we need are for people to care , to actually go use it , just like they &apos;ve cared enough to use Kiva to make those connections .
But the good news is I don &apos;t think I need to stand here and convince you to care -- I &apos;m not even going to try .
I don &apos;t think , even though we often hear , you know , hear the ethical and moral reasons , the religious reasons , &quot; Here &apos;s why caring and giving will make you happier . &quot;
I don &apos;t think we need to be convinced of that . I think we know ; in fact , I think we know so much , and it &apos;s such a reality that we care so deeply , that in fact , what usually stops us is that we &apos;re afraid to try and to mess up , because we care so very much about helping each other and being meaningful in each other &apos;s lives .
So what I think I can do today , that best thing I can give you -- I &apos;ve given you my story , which is the best I can do .
And I think I can remind us that we do care .
I think we all already know that .
And I think we know that love is resilient enough for us to get out there and try .
Just a sec .
Thanks .
Thanks .
For me , the best way to be inspired to try is to stop and to listen to someone else &apos;s story .
And I &apos;m grateful that I &apos;ve gotten to do that here at TED .
And I &apos;m grateful that whenever I do that , guaranteed , I am inspired -- I am inspired by the person I am listening to .
And I believe more and more every time I listen in that that person &apos;s potential to do great things in the world and in my own potential to maybe help .
And that -- forget the tools , forget the moving around of resources -- that stuff &apos;s easy .
Believing in each other , really being sure when push comes to shove that each one of us can do amazing things in the world , that is what can make our stories into love stories and our collective story into one that continually perpetuates hope and good things for all of us .
So that , this belief in each other , knowing that without a doubt and practicing that every day in whatever you do , that &apos;s what I believe will change the world and make tomorrow better than today .
Thank you .

So , why does good sex so often fade , even for couples who continue to love each other as much as ever ?
And why does good intimacy not guarantee good sex , contrary to popular belief ?
Or , the next question would be , can we want what we already have ?
That &apos;s the million-dollar question , right ?
And why is the forbidden so erotic ?
What is it about transgression that makes desire so potent ?
And why does sex make babies , and babies spell erotic disaster in couples ?
It &apos;s kind of the fatal erotic blow , isn &apos;t it ?
And when you love , how does it feel ?
And when you desire , how is it different ?
These are some of the questions that are at the center of my exploration on the nature of erotic desire and its concomitant dilemmas in modern love .
So I travel the globe , and what I &apos;m noticing is that everywhere where romanticism has entered , there seems to be a crisis of desire .
A crisis of desire , as in owning the wanting -- desire as an expression of our individuality , of our free choice , of our preferences , of our identity -- desire that has become a central concept as part of modern love and individualistic societies .
You know , this is the first time in the history of humankind where we are trying to experience sexuality in the long term , not because we want 14 children , for which we need to have even more because many of them won &apos;t make it , and not because it is exclusively a woman &apos;s marital duty .
This is the first time that we want sex over time about pleasure and connection that is rooted in desire .
So what sustains desire , and why is it so difficult ?
And at the heart of sustaining desire in a committed relationship , I think is the reconciliation of two fundamental human needs .
On the one hand , our need for security , for predictability , for safety , for dependability , for reliability , for permanence -- all these anchoring , grounding experiences of our lives that we call home .
But we also have an equally strong need -- men and women -- for adventure , for novelty , for mystery , for risk , for danger , for the unknown , for the unexpected , surprise -- you get the gist -- for journey , for travel .
So reconciling our need for security and our need for adventure into one relationship , or what we today like to call a passionate marriage , used to be a contradiction in terms .
Marriage was an economic institution in which you were given a partnership for life in terms of children and social status and succession and companionship .
But now we want our partner to still give us all these things , but in addition I want you to be my best friend and my trusted confidant and my passionate lover to boot , and we live twice as long .
So we come to one person , and we basically are asking them to give us what once an entire village used to provide : Give me belonging , give me identity , give me continuity , but give me transcendence and mystery and awe all in one .
Give me comfort , give me edge .
Give me novelty , give me familiarity .
Give me predictability , give me surprise .
And we think it &apos;s a given , and toys and lingerie are going to save us with that .
So now we get to the existential reality of the story , right ?
Because I think , in some way -- and I &apos;ll come back to that -- but the crisis of desire is often a crisis of the imagination .
So why does good sex so often fade ?
What is the relationship between love and desire ?
How do they relate , and how do they conflict ?
Because therein lies the mystery of eroticism .
So if there is a verb , for me , that comes with love , it &apos;s &quot; to have . &quot;
And if there is a verb that comes with desire , it is &quot; to want . &quot;
In love , we want to have , we want to know the beloved .
We want to minimize the distance . We want to contract that gap .
We want to neutralize the tensions . We want closeness .
But in desire , we tend to not really want to go back to the places we &apos;ve already gone .
Forgone conclusion does not keep our interest .
In desire , we want an Other , somebody on the other side that we can go visit , that we can go spend some time with , that we can go see what goes on in their red light district .
In desire , we want a bridge to cross .
Or in other words , I sometimes say , fire needs air .
Desire needs space .
And when it &apos;s said like that , it &apos;s often quite abstract .
But then I took a question with me .
And I &apos;ve gone to more than 20 countries in the last few years with &quot; Mating in Captivity , &quot; and I asked people , when do you find yourself most drawn to your partner ?
Not attracted sexually , per se , but most drawn .
And across culture , across religion , and across gender -- except for one -- there are a few answers that just keep coming back .
So the first group is : I am most drawn to my partner when she is away , when we are apart , when we reunite .
Basically , when I get back in touch with my ability to imagine myself with my partner , when my imagination comes back in the picture , and when I can root it in absence and in longing , which is a major component of desire .
But then the second group is even more interesting : I am most drawn to my partner when I see him in the studio , when she is onstage , when he is in his element , when she &apos;s doing something she &apos;s passionate about , when I see him at a party and other people are really drawn to him , when I see her hold court .
Basically , when I look at my partner radiant and confident , probably the biggest turn-on across the board .
Radiant , as in self-sustaining .
I look at this person -- by the way , in desire people rarely talk about it , when we are blended into one , five centimeters from each other . I don &apos;t know in inches how much that is .
But it &apos;s also not when the other person is that far apart that you no longer see them .
It &apos;s when I &apos;m looking at my partner from a comfortable distance , where this person that is already so familiar , so known , is momentarily once again somewhat mysterious , somewhat elusive .
And in this space between me and the other lies the erotic élan , lies that movement toward the other .
Because sometimes , as Proust says , mystery is not about traveling to new places , but it &apos;s about looking with new eyes .
And so , when I see my partner on his own or her own , doing something in which they are enveloped , I look at this person and I momentarily get a shift in perception , and I stay open to the mysteries that are living right next to me .
And then , more importantly , in this description about the other or myself -- it &apos;s the same -- what is most interesting is that there is no neediness in desire .
Nobody needs anybody .
There is no caretaking in desire .
Caretaking is mightily loving . It &apos;s a powerful anti-aphrodisiac .
I have yet to see somebody who is so turned on by somebody who needs them .
Wanting them is one thing . Needing them is a shutdown , and women have known that forever , because anything that will bring up parenthood will usually decrease the erotic charge .
For good reasons , right ?
And then the third group of answers usually would be when I &apos;m surprised , when we laugh together , as somebody said to me in the office today , when he &apos;s in his tux , so I said , you know , it &apos;s either the tux or the cowboy boots .
But basically it &apos;s when there is novelty .
But novelty isn &apos;t about new positions . It isn &apos;t a repertoire of techniques .
Novelty is , what parts of you do you bring out ?
What parts of you are just being seen ?
Because in some way one could say sex isn &apos;t something you do , eh ?
Sex is a place you go . It &apos;s a space you enter inside yourself and with another , or others .
So where do you go in sex ?
What parts of you do you connect to ?
What do you seek to express there ?
Is it a place for transcendence and spiritual union ?
Is it a place for naughtiness and is it a place to be safely aggressive ?
Is it a place where you can finally surrender and not have to take responsibility for everything ?
Is it a place where you can express your infantile wishes ?
What comes out there ? It &apos;s a language .
It isn &apos;t just a behavior .
And it &apos;s the poetic of that language that I &apos;m interested in , which is why I began to explore this concept of erotic intelligence .
You know , animals have sex .
It &apos;s the pivot , it &apos;s biology , it &apos;s the natural instinct .
We are the only ones who have an erotic life , which means that it &apos;s sexuality transformed by the human imagination .
We are the only ones who can make love for hours , have a blissful time , multiple orgasms , and touch nobody , just because we can imagine it .
We can hint at it . We don &apos;t even have to do it .
We can experience that powerful thing called anticipation , which is a mortar to desire , the ability to imagine it , as if it &apos;s happening , to experience it as if it &apos;s happening , while nothing is happening and everything is happening at the same time .
So when I began to think about eroticism , I began to think about the poetics of sex , and if I look at it as an intelligence , then it &apos;s something that you cultivate .
What are the ingredients ? Imagination , playfulness , novelty , curiosity , mystery .
But the central agent is really that piece called the imagination .
But more importantly , for me to begin to understand who are the couples who have an erotic spark , what sustains desire , I had to go back to the original definition of eroticism , the mystical definition , and I went through it through a bifurcation by looking actually at trauma , which is the other side , and I looked at it looking at the community that I had grown up in , which was a community in Belgium , all Holocaust survivors , and in my community there were two groups : those who didn &apos;t die , and those who came back to life .
And those who didn &apos;t die lived often very tethered to the ground , could not experience pleasure , could not trust , because when you &apos;re vigilant , worried , anxious , and insecure , you can &apos;t lift your head to go and take off in space and be playful and safe and imaginative .
Those who came back to life were those who understood the erotic as an antidote to death .
They knew how to keep themselves alive .
And when I began to listen to the sexlessness of the couples that I work with , I sometimes would hear people say , &quot; I want more sex , &quot; but generally people want better sex , and better is to reconnect with that quality of aliveness , of vibrancy , of renewal , of vitality , of eros , of energy that sex used to afford them , or that they &apos;ve hoped it would afford them .
And so I began to ask a different question .
&quot; I shut myself off when ... &quot; began to be the question .
&quot; I turn off my desires when ... &quot; which is not the same question as , &quot; What turns me of is ... &quot; and &quot; You turn me off when ... &quot;
And people began to say , &quot; I turn myself off when I feel dead inside , when I don &apos;t like my body , when I feel old , when I haven &apos;t had time for myself , when I haven &apos;t had a chance to even check in with you , when I don &apos;t perform well at work , when I feel low self esteem , when I don &apos;t have a sense of self-worth , when I don &apos;t feel like I have a right to want , to take , to receive pleasure . &quot;
And then I began to ask the reverse question .
&quot; I turn myself on when ... &quot; Because most of the time , people like to ask the question , &quot; You turn me on , what turns me on , &quot; and I &apos;m out of the question . You know ?
Now , if you are dead inside , the other person can do a lot of things for Valentine &apos;s .
It won &apos;t make a dent . There is nobody at the reception desk .
So I turn myself on when , I turn my desires , I wake up when ...
Now , in this paradox between love and desire , what seems to be so puzzling is that the very ingredients that nurture love -- mutuality , reciprocity , protection , worry , responsibility for the other -- are sometimes the very ingredients that stifle desire .
Because desire comes with a host of feelings that are not always such favorites of love : jealousy , possessiveness , aggression , power , dominance , naughtiness , mischief .
Basically most of us will get turned on at night by the very same things that we will demonstrate against during the day .
You know , the erotic mind is not very politically correct .
If everybody was fantasizing on a bed of roses , we wouldn &apos;t be having such interesting talks about this .
But no , in our mind up there are a host of things going on that we don &apos;t always know how to bring to the person that we love , because we think love comes with selflessness and in fact desire comes with a certain amount of selfishness in the best sense of the word : the ability to stay connected to one &apos;s self in the presence of another .
So I want to draw that little image for you , because this need to reconcile these two sets of needs , we are born with that .
Our need for connection , our need for separateness , or our need for security and adventure , or our need for togetherness and for autonomy , and if you think about the little kid who sits on your lap and who is cozily nested here and very secure and comfortable , and at some point all of us need to go out into the world to discover and to explore .
That &apos;s the beginning of desire , that exploratory needs curiosity , discovery .
And then at some point they turn around and they look at you , and if you tell them , &quot; Hey kiddo , the world &apos;s a great place . Go for it .
There &apos;s so much fun out there , &quot; then they can turn away and they can experience connection and separateness at the same time .
They can go off in their imagination , off in their body , off in their playfulness , all the while knowing that there &apos;s somebody when they come back .
But if on this side there is somebody who says , &quot; I &apos;m worried . I &apos;m anxious . I &apos;m depressed .
My partner hasn &apos;t taken care of me in so long .
What &apos;s so good out there ? Don &apos;t we have everything you need together , you and I ? &quot;
then there are a few little reactions that all of us can pretty much recognize .
Some of us will come back , came back a long time ago , and that little child who comes back is the child who will forgo a part of himself in order not to lose the other .
I will lose my freedom in order not to lose connection .
And I will learn to love in a certain way that will become burdened with extra worry and extra responsibility and extra protection , and I won &apos;t know how to leave you in order to go play , in order to go experience pleasure , in order to discover , to enter inside myself .
Translate this into adult language .
It starts very young . It continues into our sex lives up to the end .
Child number two comes back but looks like that over their shoulder all the time .
&quot; Are you going to be there ?
Are you going to curse me ? Are you going to scold me ?
Are you going to be angry with me ? &quot;
And they may be gone , but they &apos;re never really away , and those are often the people that will tell you , in the beginning it was super hot .
Because in the beginning , the growing intimacy wasn &apos;t yet so strong that it actually led to the decrease of desire .
The more connected I became , the more responsible I felt , the less I was able to let go in your presence .
The third child doesn &apos;t really come back .
So what happens , if you want to sustain desire , it &apos;s that real dialectic piece .
On the one hand you want the security in order to be able to go .
On the other hand if you can &apos;t go , you can &apos;t have pleasure , you can &apos;t culminate , you don &apos;t have an orgasm , you don &apos;t get excited because you spend your time in the body and the head of the other and not in your own .
So in this dilemma about reconciling these two sets of fundamental needs , there are a few things that I &apos;ve come to understand erotic couples do .
One , they have a lot of sexual privacy .
They understand that there is an erotic space that belongs to each of them .
They also understand that foreplay is not something you do five minutes before the real thing .
Foreplay pretty much starts at the end of the previous orgasm .
They also understand that an erotic space isn &apos;t about , you begin to stroke the other .
It &apos;s about you create a space where you leave Management Inc . , maybe where you leave the agile program , and you actually just enter that place where you stop being the good citizen who is taking care of things and being responsible .
Responsibility and desire just butt heads .
They don &apos;t really do well together .
Erotic couples also understand that passion waxes and wanes .
It &apos;s pretty much like the moon . It has intermittent eclipses .
But what they know is they know how to resurrect it .
They know how to bring it back , and they know how to bring it back because they have demystified one big myth , which is the myth of spontaneity , which is that it &apos;s just going to fall from heaven while you &apos;re folding the laundry like a deus ex machina , and in fact they understood that whatever is going to just happen in a long-term relationship already has .
Committed sex is premeditated sex .
It &apos;s willful . It &apos;s intentional .
It &apos;s focus and presence .
Merry Valentine &apos;s .

&lt; description &gt; In long-term relationships , we often expect our beloved to be both best friend and erotic partner . But as Esther Perel argues , good &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; and &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; committed sex draws on two conflicting needs : our need for security and our need for surprise . So how do you sustain desire ? With wit and eloquence , Perel lets us in on the mystery of erotic intelligence . &lt; / description &gt;

How many of you had to fill out some sort of web form where you &apos;ve been asked to read a distorted sequence of characters like this ?
How many of you found it really , really annoying ?
Okay , outstanding . So I invented that .
Or I was one of the people who did it .
That thing is called a CAPTCHA .
And the reason it is there is to make sure you , the entity filling out the form , are actually a human and not some sort of computer program that was written to submit the form millions and millions of times .
The reason it works is because humans , at least non-visually-impaired humans , have no trouble reading these distorted squiggly characters , whereas computer programs simply can &apos;t do it as well yet .
So for example , in the case of Ticketmaster , the reason you have to type these distorted characters is to prevent scalpers from writing a program that can buy millions of tickets , two at a time .
CAPTCHAs are used all over the Internet .
And since they &apos;re used so often , a lot of times the precise sequence of random characters that is shown to the user is not so fortunate .
So this is an example from the Yahoo registration page .
The random characters that happened to be shown to the user were W , A , I , T , which , of course , spell a word .
But the best part is the message that the Yahoo help desk got about 20 minutes later .
Text : &quot; Help ! I &apos;ve been waiting for over 20 minutes , and nothing happens . &quot;
This person thought they needed to wait .
This of course , is not as bad as this poor person .
CAPTCHA Project is something that we did here at Carnegie Melllon over 10 years ago , and it &apos;s been used everywhere .
Let me now tell you about a project that we did a few years later , which is sort of the next evolution of CAPTCHA .
This is a project that we call reCAPTCHA , which is something that we started here at Carnegie Mellon , then we turned it into a startup company .
And then about a year and a half ago , Google actually acquired this company .
So let me tell you what this project started .
So this project started from the following realization : It turns out that approximately 200 million CAPTCHAs are typed everyday by people around the world .
When I first heard this , I was quite proud of myself .
I thought , look at the impact that my research has had .
But then I started feeling bad .
See here &apos;s the thing , each time you type a CAPTCHA , essentially you waste 10 seconds of your time .
And if you multiply that by 200 million , you get that humanity as a whole is wasting about 500,000 hours every day typing these annoying CAPTCHAs .
So then I started feeling bad .
And then I started thinking , well , of course , we can &apos;t just get rid of CAPTCHAs , because the security of the Web sort of depends on them .
But then I started thinking , is there any way we can use this effort for something that is good for humanity ?
So see , here &apos;s the thing .
While you &apos;re typing a CAPTCHA , during those 10 seconds , your brain is doing something amazing .
Your brain is doing something that computers cannot yet do .
So can we get you to do useful work for those 10 seconds ?
Another way of putting it is , is there some humongous problem that we cannot yet get computers to solve , yet we can split into tiny 10-second chunks such that each time somebody solves a CAPTCHA they solve a little bit of this problem ?
And the answer to that is &quot; yes , &quot; and this is what we &apos;re doing now .
So what you may not know is that nowadays while you &apos;re typing a CAPTCHA , not only are you authenticating yourself as a human , but in addition you &apos;re actually helping us to digitize books .
So let me explain how this works .
So there &apos;s a lot of projects out there trying to digitize books .
Google has one . The Internet Archive has one .
Amazon , now with the Kindle , is trying to digitize books .
Basically the way this works is you start with an old book .
You &apos;ve seen those things , right ? Like a book ?
So you start with a book , and then you scan it .
Now scanning a book is like taking a digital photograph of every page of the book .
It gives you an image for every page of the book .
This is an image with text for every page of the book .
The next step in the process is that the computer needs to be able to decipher all of the words in this image .
That &apos;s using a technology called OCR , for optical character recognition , which takes a picture of text and tries to figure out what text is in there .
Now the problem is that OCR is not perfect .
Especially for older books where the ink has faded and the pages have turned yellow , OCR cannot recognize a lot of the words .
For example , for things that were written more than 50 years ago , the computer cannot recognize about 30 percent of the words .
So what we &apos;re doing now is we &apos;re taking all of the words that the computer cannot recognize and we &apos;re getting people to read them for us while they &apos;re typing a CAPTCHA on the Internet .
So the next time you type a CAPTCHA , these words that you &apos;re typing are actually words that are coming from books that are being digitized that the computer could not recognize .
And now the reason we have two words nowadays instead of one is because , you see , one of the words is a word that the system just got out of a book , it didn &apos;t know what it was , and it &apos;s going to present it to you .
But since it doesn &apos;t know the answer for it , it cannot grade it for you .
So what we do is we give you another word , one for which the system does know the answer .
We don &apos;t tell you which one &apos;s which , and we say , please type both .
And if you type the correct word for the one for which the system already knows the answer , it assumes you are human , and it also gets some confidence that you typed the other word correctly .
And if we repeat this process to like 10 different people and all of them agree on what the new word is , then we get one more word digitized accurately .
So this is how the system works .
And basically , since we released it about three or four years ago , a lot of websites have started switching from the old CAPTCHA where people wasted their time to the new CAPTCHA where people are helping to digitize books .
So for example , Ticketmaster .
So every time you buy tickets on Ticketmaster , you help to digitize a book .
Facebook : Every time you add a friend or poke somebody , you help to digitize a book .
Twitter and about 350,000 other sites are all using reCAPTCHA .
And in fact , the number of sites that are using reCAPTCHA is so high that the number of words that we &apos;re digitizing per day is really , really large .
It &apos;s about 100 million a day , which is the equivalent of about two and a half million books a year .
And this is all being done one word at a time by just people typing CAPTCHAs on the Internet .
Now of course , since we &apos;re doing so many words per day , funny things can happen .
And this is especially true because now we &apos;re giving people two randomly chosen English words next to each other .
So funny things can happen .
For example , we presented this word .
It &apos;s the word &quot; Christians &quot; ; there &apos;s nothing wrong with it .
But if you present it along with another randomly chosen word , bad things can happen .
So we get this .
But it &apos;s even worse , because the particular website where we showed this actually happened to be called The Embassy of the Kingdom of God .
Oops .
Here &apos;s another really bad one .
JohnEdwards.com So we keep on insulting people left and right everyday .
Now , of course , we &apos;re not just insulting people .
See here &apos;s the thing , since we &apos;re presenting two randomly chosen words , interesting things can happen .
So this actually has given rise to a really big Internet meme that tens of thousands of people have participated in , which is called CAPTCHA art .
I &apos;m sure some of you have heard about it .
Here &apos;s how it works .
Imagine you &apos;re using the Internet and you see a CAPTCHA that you think is somewhat peculiar , like this CAPTCHA .
Then what you &apos;re supposed to do is you take a screen shot of it .
Then of course , you fill out the CAPTCHA because you help us digitize a book .
But then , first you take a screen shot , and then you draw something that is related to it .
That &apos;s how it works .
There are tens of thousands of these .
Some of them are very cute .
Some of them are funnier .
And some of them , like paleontological shvisle , they contain Snoop Dogg .
Okay , so this is my favorite number of reCAPTCHA .
So this is the favorite thing that I like about this whole project .
This is the number of distinct people that have helped us digitize at least one word out of a book through reCAPTCH 750 million , which is a little over 10 percent of the world &apos;s population , has helped us digitize human knowledge .
And it is numbers like these that motivate my research agenda .
So the question that motivates my research is the following : If you look at humanity &apos;s large-scale achievements , these really big things that humanity has gotten together and done historically -- like for example , building the pyramids of Egypt or the Panama Canal or putting a man on the Moon -- there is a curious fact about them , and it is that they were all done with about the same number off people .
It &apos;s weird ; they were all done with about 100,000 people .
And the reason for that is because , before the Internet , coordinating more than 100,000 people , let alone paying them , was essentially impossible .
But now with the Internet , I &apos;ve just shown you a project where we &apos;ve gotten 750 million people to help us digitize human knowledge .
So the question that motivates my research is , if we can put a man on the Moon with 100,000 , what can we do with 100 million ?
So based on this question , we &apos;ve had a lot of different projects that we &apos;ve been working on .
Let me tell you about one that I &apos;m most excited about .
This is something that we &apos;ve been semi-quietly working on for the last year and a half or so .
It hasn &apos;t yet been launched . It &apos;s called Duolingo .
Since it hasn &apos;t been launched , shhhhh !
Yeah , I can trust you &apos;ll do that .
So this is the project . Here &apos;s how it started .
It started with me posing a question to my graduate student , Severin Hacker .
Okay , that &apos;s Severin Hacker .
So I posed the question to my graduate student .
By the way , you did hear me correctly ; his last name is Hacker .
So I posed this question to him : How can we get 100 million people translating the Web into every major language for free ?
Okay , so there &apos;s a lot of things to say about this question .
First of all , translating the Web .
So right now the Web is partitioned into multiple languages .
A large fraction of it is in English .
If you don &apos;t know any English , you can &apos;t access it .
But there &apos;s large fractions in other different languages , and if you don &apos;t know those languages , you can &apos;t access it .
So I would like to translate all of the Web , or at least most of the Web , into every major language .
So that &apos;s what I would like to do .
Now some of you may say , why can &apos;t we use computers to translate ?
Why can &apos;t we use machine translation ?
Machine translation nowadays is starting to translate some sentences here and there .
Why can &apos;t we use it to translate the whole Web ?
Well the problem with that is that it &apos;s not yet good enough and it probably won &apos;t be for the next 15 to 20 years .
It makes a lot of mistakes .
Even when it doesn &apos;t make a mistake , since it makes so many mistakes , you don &apos;t know whether to trust it or not .
So let me show you an example of something that was translated with a machine .
Actually it was a forum post .
It was somebody who was trying to ask a question about JavaScript .
It was translated from Japanese into English .
So I &apos;ll just let you read .
This person starts apologizing for the fact that it &apos;s translated with a computer .
So the next sentence is is going to be the preamble to the question .
So he &apos;s just explaining something .
Remember , it &apos;s a question about JavaScript .
Then comes the first part of the question .
Then comes my favorite part of the question .
And then comes the ending , which is my favorite part of the whole thing .
Okay , so computer translation , not yet good enough .
So back to the question .
So we need people to translate the whole Web .
So now the next question you may have is , well why can &apos;t we just pay people to do this ?
We could pay professional language translators to translate the whole Web .
We could do that .
Unfortunately , it would be extremely expensive .
For example , translating a tiny , tiny fraction of the whole Web , Wikipedia , into one other language , Spanish .
Wikipedia exists in Spanish , but it &apos;s very small compared to the size of English .
It &apos;s about 20 percent of the size of English .
If we wanted to translate the other 80 percent into Spanish , it would cost at least 50 million dollars -- and this is at even the most exploited , outsourcing country out there .
So it would be very expensive .
So what we want to do is we want to get 100 million people translating the Web into every major language for free .
Now if this is what you want to do , you pretty quickly realize you &apos;re going to run into two pretty big hurdles , two big obstacles .
The first one is a lack of bilinguals .
So I don &apos;t even know if there exists 100 million people out there using the Web who are bilingual enough to help us translate .
That &apos;s a big problem .
The other problem you &apos;re going to run into is a lack of motivation .
How are we going to motivate people to actually translate the Web for free ?
Normally , you have to pay people to do this .
So how are we going to motivate them to do it for free ?
Now when we were starting to think about this , we were blocked by these two things .
But then we realized , there &apos;s actually a way to solve both these problems with the same solution .
There &apos;s a way to kill two birds with one stone .
And that is to transform language translation into something that millions of people want to do , and that also helps with the problem of lack of bilinguals , and that is language education .
So it turns out that today , there are over 1.2 billion people learning a foreign language .
People really , really want to learn a foreign language .
And it &apos;s not just because they &apos;re being forced to do so in school .
For example , in the United States alone , there are over five million people who have paid over $ 500 for software to learn a new language .
So people really , really want to learn a new language .
So what we &apos;ve been working on for the last year and a half is a new website -- it &apos;s called Duolingo -- where the basic idea is people learn a new language for free while simultaneously translating the Web .
And so basically they &apos;re learning by doing .
So the way this works is whenever you &apos;re a just a beginner , we give you very , very simple sentences .
There &apos;s , of course , a lot of very simple sentences on the Web .
We give you very , very simple sentences along with what each word means .
And as you translate them , and as you see how other people translate them , you start learning the language .
And as you get more and more advanced , we give you more and more complex sentences to translate .
But at all times , you &apos;re learning by doing .
Now the crazy thing about this method is that it actually really works .
First of all , people are really , really learning a language .
We &apos;re mostly done building it , and now we &apos;re testing it .
People really can learn a language with it .
And they learn it about as well as the leading language learning software .
So people really do learn a language .
And not only do they learn it as well , but actually it &apos;s way more interesting .
Because you see with Duolingo , people are actually learning with real content .
As opposed to learning with made-up sentences , people are learning with real content , which is inherently interesting .
So people really do learn a language .
But perhaps more surprisingly , the translations that we get from people using the site , even though they &apos;re just beginners , the translations that we get are as accurate as those of professional language translators , which is very surprising .
So let me show you one example .
This is a sentence that was translated from German into English .
The top is the German .
The middle is an English translation that was done by somebody who was a professional English translator who we paid 20 cents a word for this translation .
And the bottom is a translation by users of Duolingo , none of whom knew any German before they started using the site .
You can see , it &apos;s pretty much perfect .
Now of course , we play a trick here to make the translations as good as professional language translators .
We combine the translations of multiple beginners to get the quality of a single professional translator .
Now even though we &apos;re combining the translations , the site actually can translate pretty fast .
So let me show you , this is our estimates of how fast we could translate Wikipedia from English into Spanish .
Remember , this is 50 million dollars-worth of value .
So if we wanted to translate Wikipedia into Spanish , we could do it in five weeks with 100,000 active users .
And we could do it in about 80 hours with a million active users .
Since all the projects that my group has worked on so far have gotten millions of users , we &apos;re hopeful that we &apos;ll be able to translate extremely fast with this project .
Now the thing that I &apos;m most excited about with Duolingo is I think this provides a fair business model for language education .
So here &apos;s the thing : The current business model for language education is the student pays , and in particular , the student pays Rosetta Stone 500 dollars .
That &apos;s the current business model .
The problem with this business model is that 95 percent of the world &apos;s population doesn &apos;t have 500 dollars .
So it &apos;s extremely unfair towards the poor .
This is totally biased towards the rich .
Now see , in Duolingo , because while you learn you &apos;re actually creating value , you &apos;re translating stuff -- which for example , we could charge somebody for translations .
So this is how we could monetize this .
Since people are creating value while they &apos;re learning , they don &apos;t have to pay their money , they pay with their time .
But the magical thing here is that they &apos;re paying with their time , but that is time that would have had to have been spent anyways learning the language .
So the nice thing about Duolingo is I think it provides a fair business model -- one that doesn &apos;t discriminate against poor people .
So here &apos;s the site . Thank you .
So here &apos;s the site .
We haven &apos;t yet launched , but if you go there , you can sign up to be part of our private beta , which is probably going to start in about three or four weeks .
We haven &apos;t yet launched this Duolingo .
By the way , I &apos;m the one talking here , but actually Duolingo is the work of a really awesome team , some of whom are here .
So thank you .

We &apos;re going to go on a dive to the deep sea , and anyone that &apos;s had that lovely opportunity knows that for about two and half hours on the way down , it &apos;s a perfectly positively pitch-black world .
And we used to see the most mysterious animals out the window that you couldn &apos;t describe : these blinking lights -- a world of bioluminescence , like fireflies .
Dr. Edith Widder -- she &apos;s now at the Ocean Research and Conservation Association -- was able to come up with a camera that could capture some of these incredible animals , and that &apos;s what you &apos;re seeing here on the screen .
That &apos;s all bioluminescence . So , like I said : just like fireflies .
There &apos;s a flying turkey under a tree .
I &apos;m a geologist by training . But I love that .
And you see , some of the bioluminescence they use to avoid being eaten , some they use to attract prey , but all of it , from an artistic point of view , is positively amazing .
And a lot of what goes on inside ...
there &apos;s a fish with glowing eyes , pulsating eyes .
Some of the colors are designed to hypnotize , these lovely patterns . And then this last one , one of my favorites , this pinwheel design .
Just absolutely amazing , every single dive .
That &apos;s the unknown world , and today we &apos;ve only explored about 3 percent Already we &apos;ve found the world &apos;s highest mountains , the world &apos;s deepest valleys , underwater lakes , underwater waterfalls -- a lot of that we shared with you from the stage .
And in a place where we thought no life at all , we find more life , we think , and diversity and density than the tropical rainforest , which tells us that we don &apos;t know much about this planet at all .
There &apos;s still 97 percent , and either that 97 percent is empty or just full of surprises .
But I want to jump up to shallow water now and look at some creatures that are positively amazing .
Cephalopods -- head-foots . As a kid I knew them as calamari , mostly .
This is an octopus -- this is the work of Dr. Roger Hanlon at the Marine Biological Lab -- and it &apos;s just fascinating how cephalopods can , with their incredible eyes , sense their surroundings , look at light , look at patterns .
Here &apos;s an octopus moving across the reef , finds a spot to settle down , curls up and then disappears into the background .
Tough thing to do .
In the next bit , we &apos;re going to see a couple squid .
These are squid . Now males , when they fight , if they &apos;re really aggressive , they turn white .
And these two males are fighting , they do it by bouncing their butts together , which is an interesting concept . Now , here &apos;s a male on the left and a female on the right , and the male has managed to split his coloration so the female only always sees the kinder gentler squid in him .
And the male ... We &apos;re going to see it again .
white on the right , brown on the left .
He takes a step back -- so he &apos;s keeping off the other males by splitting his body -- and comes up on the other side ...
Bingo ! Now I &apos;m told that &apos;s not just a squid phenomenon with males , but I don &apos;t know .
Cuttlefish . I love cuttlefish . This is a Giant Australian Cuttlefish .
And there he is , his droopy little eyes up here .
But they can do pretty amazing things , too .
Here we &apos;re going to see one backing into a crevice , and watch his tentacles -- he just pulls them in , makes them look just like algae .
Disappears right into the background .
Positively amazing . Here &apos;s two males fighting .
Once again , they &apos;re smart enough , these cephalopods ; they know not to hurt each other .
But look at the patterns that they can do with their skin .
That &apos;s an amazing thing .
Here &apos;s an octopus . Sometimes they don &apos;t want to be seen when they move because predators can see them .
Here , this guy actually can make himself look like a rock , and , looking at his environment , can actually slide across the bottom , using the waves and the shadows so he can &apos;t be seen .
His motion blends right into the background -- the moving rock trick . So , we &apos;re learning lots new from the shallow water .
Still exploring the deep , but learning lots from the shallow water .
There &apos;s a good reason why : the shallow water &apos;s full of predators -- here &apos;s a barracuda -- and if you &apos;re an octopus or a cephalopod , you need to really understand how to use your surroundings to hide .
In the next scene , you &apos;re going to see a nice coral bottom .
And you see that an octopus would stand out very easily there if you couldn &apos;t use your camouflage , use your skin to change color and texture .
Here &apos;s some algae in the foreground ...
and an octopus . Ain &apos;t that amazing ? Now , Roger spooked him so he took off in a cloud of ink , and when he lands the octopus says , &quot; Oh , I &apos;ve been seen .
The best thing to do is to get as big as I can get . &quot;
That big brown makes his eyespot very big .
So , he &apos;s bluffing . Let &apos;s do it backwards -- I thought he was joking when he first showed it to me .
I thought it was all graphics -- so here it is in reverse .
Watch the skin color ; watch the skin texture .
Just an amazing animal , it can change color and texture to match the surroundings . Watch him blend right into this algae .
One , two , three .
And now he &apos;s gone , and so am I. Thank you very much .

&lt; url &gt; http : / / www.ted.com / talks / malcolm _ gladwell _ on _ spaghetti _ sauce.html &lt; / url &gt;
I think I was supposed to talk about my new book , which is called &quot; Blink , &quot; and it &apos;s about snap judgments and first impressions .
And it comes out in January , and I hope you all buy it in triplicate .
But I was thinking about this , and I realized that although my new book makes me happy , and I think would make my mother happy , it &apos;s not really about happiness .
So I decided instead , I would talk about someone who I think has done as much to make Americans happy as perhaps anyone over the last 20 years , a man who is a great personal hero of mine : someone by the name of Howard Moskowitz , who is most famous for reinventing spaghetti sauce .
Howard &apos;s about this high , and he &apos;s round , and he &apos;s in his 60s , and he has big huge glasses and thinning grey hair , and he has a kind of wonderful exuberance and vitality , and he has a parrot , and he loves the opera , and he &apos;s a great aficionado of medieval history .
And by profession , he &apos;s a psychophysicist .
Now , I should tell you that I have no idea what psychophysics is , although at some point in my life , I dated a girl for two years who was getting her doctorate in psychophysics .
Which should tell you something about that relationship .
As far as I know , psychophysics is about measuring things .
And Howard is very interested in measuring things .
And he graduated with his doctorate from Harvard , and he set up a little consulting shop in White Plains , New York .
And one of his first clients was -- this is many years ago , back in the early &apos; 70s -- one of his first clients was Pepsi .
And Pepsi came to Howard and they said , &quot; You know , there &apos;s this new thing called aspartame , and we would like to make Diet Pepsi .
We &apos;d like you to figure out how much aspartame we should put in each can of Diet Pepsi , in order to have the perfect drink . &quot; Right ?
Now that sounds like an incredibly straightforward question to answer , and that &apos;s what Howard thought . Because Pepsi told him , &quot; Look , we &apos;re working with a band between eight and 12 percent .
Anything below eight percent sweetness is not sweet enough ; anything above 12 percent sweetness is too sweet .
We want to know : what &apos;s the sweet spot between eight and 12 ? &quot;
Now , if I gave you this problem to do , you would all say , it &apos;s very simple .
What we do is you make up a big experimental batch of Pepsi , at every degree of sweetness -- eight percent , 8.1 , 8.2 , 8.3 , all the way up to 12 -- and we try this out with thousands of people , and we plot the results on a curve , and we take the most popular concentration . Right ? Really simple .
Howard does the experiment , and he gets the data back , and he plots it on a curve , and all of a sudden he realizes it &apos;s not a nice bell curve .
In fact , the data doesn &apos;t make any sense .
It &apos;s a mess . It &apos;s all over the place .
Now , most people in that business , in the world of testing food and such , are not dismayed when the data comes back a mess .
They think , well , you know , figuring out what people think about cola &apos;s not that easy .
You know , maybe we made an error somewhere along the way .
You know , let &apos;s just make an educated guess , and they simply point and they go for 10 percent , right in the middle .
Howard is not so easily placated .
Howard is a man of a certain degree of intellectual standards .
And this was not good enough for him , and this question bedeviled him for years .
And he would think it through and say , what was wrong ?
Why could we not make sense of this experiment with Diet Pepsi ?
And one day , he was sitting in a diner in White Plains , about to go trying to dream up some work for Nescafe .
And suddenly , like a bolt of lightning , the answer came to him .
And that is , that when they analyzed the Diet Pepsi data , they were asking the wrong question .
They were looking for the perfect Pepsi , and they should have been looking for the perfect Pepsis . Trust me .
This was an enormous revelation .
This was one of the most brilliant breakthroughs in all of food science .
And Howard immediately went on the road , and he would go to conferences around the country , and he would stand up and he would say , &quot; You had been looking for the perfect Pepsi . You &apos;re wrong .
You should be looking for the perfect Pepsis . &quot;
And people would look at him with a blank look , and they would say , &quot; What are you talking about ? This is craziness . &quot;
And they would say , you know , &quot; Move ! Next ! &quot;
Tried to get business , nobody would hire him -- he was obsessed , though , and he talked about it and talked about it and talked about it .
Howard loves the Yiddish expression &quot; To a worm in horseradish , the world is horseradish . &quot;
This was his horseradish . He was obsessed with it !
And finally , he had a breakthrough . Vlasic Pickles came to him , and they said , &quot; Mr. Moskowitz -- Doctor Moskowitz -- we want to make the perfect pickle . &quot; And he said , &quot; There is no perfect pickle ; there are only perfect pickles . &quot;
And he came back to them and he said , &quot; You don &apos;t just need to improve your regular ; you need to create zesty . &quot;
And that &apos;s where we got zesty pickles .
Then the next person came to him , and that was Campbell &apos;s Soup .
And this was even more important . In fact , Campbell &apos;s Soup is where Howard made his reputation .
Campbell &apos;s made Prego , and Prego , in the early &apos; 80s , was struggling next to Ragu , which was the dominant spaghetti sauce of the &apos; 70s and &apos; 80s .
Now in the industry -- I don &apos;t know whether you care about this , or how much time I have to go into this .
But it was , technically speaking -- this is an aside -- Prego is a better tomato sauce than Ragu .
The quality of the tomato paste is much better ; the spice mix is far superior ; it adheres to the pasta in a much more pleasing way . In fact , they would do the famous bowl test back in the &apos; 70s with Ragu and Prego .
You &apos;d have a plate of spaghetti , and you would pour it on , right ?
And the Ragu would all go to the bottom , and the Prego would sit on top .
That &apos;s called &quot; adherence . &quot;
And , anyway , despite the fact that they were far superior in adherence , and the quality of their tomato paste , Prego was struggling .
So they came to Howard , and they said , fix us .
And Howard looked at their product line , and he said , what you have is a dead tomato society .
So he said , this is what I want to do .
And he got together with the Campbell &apos;s soup kitchen , and he made 45 varieties of spaghetti sauce . And he varied them according to every conceivable way that you can vary tomato sauce : by sweetness , by level of garlic , by tartness , by sourness , by tomatoey-ness , by visible solids -- my favorite term in the spaghetti sauce business .
Every conceivable way you can vary spaghetti sauce , he varied spaghetti sauce .
And then he took this whole raft of 45 spaghetti sauces , and he went on the road .
He went to New York ; he went to Chicago ; he went to Jacksonville ; he went to Los Angeles . And he brought in people by the truckload . Into big halls .
And he sat them down for two hours , and he gave them , over the course of that two hours , ten bowls .
Ten small bowls of pasta , with a different spaghetti sauce on each one .
And after they ate each bowl , they had to rate , from 0 to 100 , how good they thought the spaghetti sauce was .
At the end of that process , after doing it for months and months , he had a mountain of data about how the American people feel about spaghetti sauce .
And then he analyzed the data .
Now , did he look for the most popular brand variety of spaghetti sauce ? No !
Howard doesn &apos;t believe that there is such a thing .
Instead , he looked at the data , and he said , let &apos;s see if we can group all these different data points into clusters .
Let &apos;s see if they congregate around certain ideas .
And sure enough , if you sit down , and you analyze all this data on spaghetti sauce , you realize that all Americans fall into one of three groups .
There are people who like their spaghetti sauce plain ; there are people who like their spaghetti sauce spicy ; and there are people who like it extra chunky .
And of those three facts , the third one was the most significant , because at the time , in the early 1980s , if you went to a supermarket , you would not find extra-chunky spaghetti sauce .
And Prego turned to Howard , and they said , &quot; You telling me that one third of Americans crave extra-chunky spaghetti sauce and yet no one is servicing their needs ? &quot; And he said yes !
And Prego then went back , and completely reformulated their spaghetti sauce , and came out with a line of extra chunky that immediately and completely took over the spaghetti sauce business in this country .
And over the next 10 years , they made 600 million dollars off their line of extra-chunky sauces .
And everyone else in the industry looked at what Howard had done , and they said , &quot; Oh my god ! We &apos;ve been thinking all wrong ! &quot;
And that &apos;s when you started to get seven different kinds of vinegar , and 14 different kinds of mustard , and 71 different kinds of olive oil -- and then eventually even Ragu hired Howard , and Howard did the exact same thing for Ragu that he did for Prego .
And today , if you go to the supermarket , a really good one , and you look at how many Ragus there are -- do you know how many they are ? 36 !
In six varieties : Cheese , Light , Robusto , Rich &amp; amp ; Hearty , Old World Traditional , Extra-Chunky Garden .
That &apos;s Howard &apos;s doing . That is Howard &apos;s gift to the American people .
Now why is that important ?
It is , in fact , enormously important . I &apos;ll explain to you why .
What Howard did is he fundamentally changed the way the food industry thinks about making you happy .
Assumption number one in the food industry used to be that the way to find out what people want to eat -- what will make people happy -- is to ask them .
And for years and years and years and years , Ragu and Prego would have focus groups , and they would sit all you people down , and they would say , &quot; What do you want in a spaghetti sauce ? Tell us what you want in a spaghetti sauce . &quot;
And for all those years -- 20 , 30 years -- through all those focus group sessions , no one ever said they wanted extra-chunky .
Even though at least a third of them , deep in their hearts , actually did .
People don &apos;t know what they want ! Right ?
As Howard loves to say , &quot; The mind knows not what the tongue wants . &quot;
It &apos;s a mystery !
And a critically important step in understanding our own desires and tastes is to realize that we cannot always explain what we want deep down .
If I asked all of you , for example , in this room , what you want in a coffee , you know what you &apos;d say ? Every one of you would say , &quot; I want a dark , rich , hearty roast . &quot;
It &apos;s what people always say when you ask them what they want in a coffee .
What do you like ? Dark , rich , hearty roast !
What percentage of you actually like a dark , rich , hearty roast ?
According to Howard , somewhere between 25 and 27 percent of you .
Most of you like milky , weak coffee .
But you will never , ever say to someone who asks you what you want that &quot; I want a milky , weak coffee . &quot;
So that &apos;s number one thing that Howard did .
Number two thing that Howard did is he made us realize -- it &apos;s another very critical point -- he made us realize in the importance of what he likes to call &quot; horizontal segmentation . &quot;
Why is this critical ? It &apos;s critical because this is the way the food industry thought before Howard . Right ?
What were they obsessed with in the early &apos; 80s ? They were obsessed with mustard .
In particular , they were obsessed with the story of Grey Poupon . Right ?
Used to be , there were two mustards . French &apos;s and Gulden &apos;s .
What were they ? Yellow mustard . What &apos;s in yellow mustard ?
Yellow mustard seeds , turmeric , and paprika . That was mustard .
Grey Poupon came along , with a Dijon . Right ?
Much more volatile brown mustard seed , some white wine , a nose hit , much more delicate aromatics . And what do they do ?
They put it in a little tiny glass jar , with a wonderful enameled label on it , made it look French , even though it &apos;s made in Oxnard , California .
And instead of charging a dollar-fifty for the eight-ounce bottle , the way that French &apos;s and Gulden &apos;s did , they decided to charge four dollars .
And then they had those ads , right ? With the guy in the Rolls Royce , and he &apos;s eating the Grey Poupon . The other Rolls Royce pulls up , and he says , do you have any Grey Poupon ?
And the whole thing , after they did that , Grey Poupon takes off !
Takes over the mustard business !
And everyone &apos;s take-home lesson from that was that the way to get to make people happy is to give them something that is more expensive , something to aspire to . Right ?
It &apos;s to make them turn their back on what they think they like now , and reach out for something higher up the mustard hierarchy .
A better mustard ! A more expensive mustard !
A mustard of more sophistication and culture and meaning .
And Howard looked to that and said , that &apos;s wrong !
Mustard does not exist on a hierarchy .
Mustard exists , just like tomato sauce , on a horizontal plane .
There is no good mustard or bad mustard .
There is no perfect mustard or imperfect mustard .
There are only different kinds of mustards that suit different kinds of people .
He fundamentally democratized the way we think about taste .
And for that , as well , we owe Howard Moskowitz a huge vote of thanks .
Third thing that Howard did , and perhaps the most important , is Howard confronted the notion of the Platonic dish .
What do I mean by that ?
For the longest time in the food industry , there was a sense that there was one way , a perfect way , to make a dish .
You go to Chez Panisse , they give you the red-tail sashimi with roasted pumpkin seeds in a something something reduction .
They don &apos;t give you five options on the reduction , right ?
They don &apos;t say , do you want the extra-chunky reduction , or do you want the -- no !
You just get the reduction . Why ? Because the chef at Chez Panisse has a Platonic notion about red-tail sashimi .
This is the way it ought to be .
And she serves it that way time and time again , and if you quarrel with her , she will say , &quot; You know what ? You &apos;re wrong ! This is the best way it ought to be in this restaurant . &quot;
Now that same idea fueled the commercial food industry as well .
They had a notion , a Platonic notion , of what tomato sauce was .
And where did that come from ? It came from Italy .
Italian tomato sauce is what ? It &apos;s blended ; it &apos;s thin .
The culture of tomato sauce was thin .
When we talked about authentic tomato sauce in the 1970s , we talked about Italian tomato sauce . We talked about the earliest ragus , which had no visible solids , right ?
Which were thin , and you just put a little bit over it and it sunk down to the bottom of the pasta .
That &apos;s what it was . And why were we attached to that ?
Because we thought that what it took to make people happy was to provide them with the most culturally authentic tomato sauce , A ; and B , we thought that if we gave them the culturally authentic tomato sauce , then they would embrace it .
And that &apos;s what would please the maximum number of people .
And the reason we thought that -- in other words , people in the cooking world were looking for cooking universals .
They were looking for one way to treat all of us .
And it &apos;s good reason for them to be obsessed with the idea of universals , because all of science , through the 19th century and much of the 20th , was obsessed with universals .
Psychologists , medical scientists , economists were all interested in finding out the rules that govern the way all of us behave .
But that changed , right ?
What is the great revolution in science of the last 10 , 15 years ?
It is the movement from the search for universals to the understanding of variability .
Now in medical science , we don &apos;t want to know how necessarily -- just how cancer works , we want to know how your cancer is different from my cancer .
I guess my cancer different from your cancer .
Genetics has opened the door to the study of human variability .
What Howard Moskowitz was doing was saying , this same revolution needs to happen in the world of tomato sauce .
And for that , we owe him a great vote of thanks .
I &apos;ll give you one last illustration of variability , and that is -- oh , I &apos;m sorry .
Howard not only believed that , but he took it a second step , which was to say that when we pursue universal principles in food , we aren &apos;t just making an error ; we are actually doing ourselves a massive disservice .
And the example he used was coffee .
And coffee is something he did a lot of work with , with Nescafe .
If I were to ask all of you to try and come up with a brand of coffee -- a type of coffee , a brew -- that made all of you happy , and then I asked you to rate that coffee , the average score in this room for coffee would be about 60 on a scale of 0 to 100 .
If , however , you allowed me to break you into coffee clusters , maybe three or four coffee clusters , and I could make coffee just for each of those individual clusters , your scores would go from 60 to 75 or 78 .
The difference between coffee at 60 and coffee at 78 is a difference between coffee that makes you wince , and coffee that makes you deliriously happy .
That is the final , and I think most beautiful lesson , of Howard Moskowitz : that in embracing the diversity of human beings , we will find a surer way to true happiness .
Thank you .

Do you worry about what is going to kill you ?
Heart disease , cancer , a car accident ?
Most of us worry about things we can &apos;t control , like war , terrorism , the tragic earthquake that just occurred in Haiti .
But what really threatens humanity ?
A few years ago , Professor Vaclav Smil tried to calculate the probability of sudden disasters large enough to change history .
He called these , &quot; massively fatal discontinuities , &quot; meaning that they could kill up to 100 million people in the next 50 years .
He looked at the odds of another world war , of a massive volcanic eruption , even of an asteroid hitting the Earth .
But he placed the likelihood of one such event above all others at close to 100 percent , and that is a severe flu pandemic .
Now , you might think of flu as just a really bad cold , but it can be a death sentence .
Every year , 36,000 people in the United States die of seasonal flu .
In the developing world , the data is much sketchier but the death toll is almost certainly higher .
You know , the problem is if this virus occasionally mutates so dramatically , it essentially is a new virus and then we get a pandemic .
In 1918 , a new virus appeared that killed some 50 to 100 million people .
It spread like wildfire and some died within hours of developing symptoms .
Are we safer today ?
Well , we seem to have dodged the deadly pandemic this year that most of us feared , but this threat could reappear at any time .
The good news is that we &apos;re at a moment in time when science , technology , globalization is converging to create an unprecedented possibility : the possibility to make history by preventing infectious diseases that still account for one-fifth of all deaths and countless misery on Earth .
We can do this .
We &apos;re already preventing millions of deaths with existing vaccines , and if we get these to more people , we can certainly save more lives .
But with new or better vaccines for malaria , TB , HIV , pneumonia , diarrhea , flu , we could end suffering that has been on the Earth since the beginning of time .
So , I &apos;m here to trumpet vaccines for you .
But first , I have to explain why they &apos;re important because vaccines , the power of them , is really like a whisper .
When they work , they can make history , but after a while you can barely hear them .
Now , some of us are old enough to have a small , circular scar on our arms from an inoculation we received as children .
But when was the last time you worried about smallpox , a disease that killed half a billion people last century and no longer is with us ?
Or polio ? How many of you remember the iron lung ?
We don &apos;t see scenes like this anymore because of vaccines .
Now , it &apos;s interesting because there are 30-odd diseases that can be treated with vaccines now , but we &apos;re still threatened by things like HIV and flu .
Why is that ?
Well , here &apos;s the dirty little secret .
Until recently , we haven &apos;t had to know exactly how a vaccine worked .
We knew they worked through old-fashioned trial and error .
You took a pathogen , you modified it , you injected it into a person or an animal and you saw what happened .
This worked well for most pathogens , somewhat well for crafty bugs like flu , but not at all for HIV , for which humans have no natural immunity .
So let &apos;s explore how vaccines work .
They basically create a cache of weapons for your immune system which you can deploy when needed .
Now , when you get a viral infection , what normally happens is it takes days or weeks for your body to fight back at full strength , and that might be too late .
When you &apos;re pre-immunized , what happens is you have forces in your body pre-trained to recognize and defeat specific foes .
So that &apos;s really how vaccines work .
Now , let &apos;s take a look at a video that we &apos;re debuting at TED , for the first time , on how an effective HIV vaccine might work .
A vaccine trains the body in advance how to recognize and neutralize a specific invader .
After HIV penetrates the body &apos;s mucosal barriers , it infects immune cells to replicate .
The invader draws the attention of the immune system &apos;s front-line troops .
Dendritic cells , or macrophages , capture the virus and display pieces of it .
Memory cells generated by the HIV vaccine are activated when they learn HIV is present from the front-line troops .
These memory cells immediately deploy the exact weapons needed .
Memory B cells turn into plasma cells , which produce wave after wave of the specific antibodies that latch onto HIV to prevent it from infecting cells , while squadrons of killer T cells seek out and destroy cells that are already HIV infected .
The virus is defeated .
Without a vaccine , these responses would have taken more than a week .
By that time , the battle against HIV would already have been lost .
Seth Berkley : Really cool video , isn &apos;t it ?
The antibodies you just saw in this video , in action , are the ones that make most vaccines work .
So the real question then is : How do we ensure that your body makes the exact ones that we need to protect against flu and HIV ?
The principal challenge for both of these viruses is that they &apos;re always changing .
So let &apos;s take a look at the flu virus .
In this rendering of the flu virus , these different colored spikes are what it uses to infect you .
And also , what the antibodies use is a handle to essentially grab and neutralize the virus .
When these mutate , they change their shape , and the antibodies don &apos;t know what they &apos;re looking at anymore .
So that &apos;s why every year you can catch a slightly different strain of flu .
It &apos;s also why in the spring , we have to make a best guess at which three strains are going to prevail the next year , put those into a single vaccine and rush those into production for the fall .
Even worse , the most common influenza -- influenza A -- also infects animals that live in close proximity to humans , and they can recombine in those particular animals .
In addition , wild aquatic birds carry all known strains of influenza .
So , you &apos;ve got this situation : In 2003 , we had an H5N1 virus that jumped from birds into humans in a few isolated cases with an apparent mortality rate of 70 percent .
Now luckily , that particular virus , although very scary at the time , did not transmit from person to person very easily .
This year &apos;s H1N1 threat was actually a human , avian , swine mixture that arose in Mexico .
It was easily transmitted , but , luckily , was pretty mild .
And so , in a sense , our luck is holding out , but you know , another wild bird could fly over at anytime .
Now let &apos;s take a look at HIV .
As variable as flu is , HIV makes flu look like the Rock of Gibraltar .
The virus that causes AIDS is the trickiest pathogen scientists have ever confronted .
It mutates furiously , it has decoys to evade the immune system , it attacks the very cells that are trying to fight it and it quickly hides itself in your genome .
Here &apos;s a slide looking at the genetic variation of flu and comparing that to HIV , a much wilder target .
In the video a moment ago , you saw fleets of new viruses launching from infected cells .
Now realize that in a recently infected person , there are millions of these ships ; each one is just slightly different .
Finding a weapon that recognizes and sinks all of them makes the job that much harder .
Now , in the 27 years since HIV was identified as the cause of AIDS , we &apos;ve developed more drugs to treat HIV than all other viruses put together .
These drugs aren &apos;t cures , but they represent a huge triumph of science because they take away the automatic death sentence from a diagnosis of HIV , at least for those who can access them .
The vaccine effort though is really quite different .
Large companies moved away from it because they thought the science was so difficult and vaccines were seen as poor business .
Many thought that it was just impossible to make an AIDS vaccine , but today , evidence tells us otherwise .
In September , we had surprising but exciting findings from a clinical trial that took place in Thailand .
For the first time , we saw an AIDS vaccine work in humans -- albeit , quite modestly -- and that particular vaccine was made almost a decade ago .
Newer concepts and early testing now show even greater promise in the best of our animal models .
But in the past few months , researchers have also isolated several new broadly neutralizing antibodies from the blood of an HIV infected individual .
Now , what does this mean ?
We saw earlier that HIV is highly variable , that a broad neutralizing antibody latches on and disables multiple variations of the virus .
If you take these and you put them in the best of our monkey models , they provide full protection from infection .
In addition , these researchers found a new site on HIV where the antibodies can grab onto , and what &apos;s so special about this spot is that it changes very little as the virus mutates .
It &apos;s like , as many times as the virus changes its clothes , it &apos;s still wearing the same socks , and now our job is to make sure we get the body to really hate those socks .
So what we &apos;ve got is a situation .
The Thai results tell us we can make an AIDS vaccine , and the antibody findings tell us how we might do that .
This strategy , working backwards from an antibody to create a vaccine candidate , has never been done before in vaccine research .
It &apos;s called retro-vaccinology , and its implications extend way beyond that of just HIV .
We &apos;ve got these new antibodies we &apos;ve identified , and we know that they latch onto many , many variations of the virus .
We know that they have to latch onto a specific part , so if we can figure out the precise structure of that part , present that through a vaccine , what we hope is we can prompt your immune system to make these matching antibodies .
And that would create a universal HIV vaccine .
Now , it sounds easier than it is because the structure actually looks more like this blue antibody diagram attached to its yellow binding site , and as you can imagine , these three-dimensional structures are much harder to work on .
And if you guys have ideas to help us solve this , we &apos;d love to hear about it .
But , you know , the research that has occurred from HIV now has really helped with innovation with other diseases .
So for instance , a biotechnology company has now found broadly neutralizing antibodies to influenza , as well as a new antibody target on the flu virus .
They &apos;re currently making a cocktail -- an antibody cocktail -- that can be used to treat severe , overwhelming cases of flu .
In the longer term , what they can do is use these tools of retro-vaccinology to make a preventive flu vaccine .
Now , retro-vaccinology is just one technique within the ambit of so-called rational vaccine design .
Let me give you another example .
We talked about before the H and N spikes on the surface of the flu virus .
Notice these other , smaller protuberances .
These are largely hidden from the immune system .
Now it turns out that these spots also don &apos;t change much when the virus mutates .
If you can cripple these with specific antibodies , you could cripple all versions of the flu .
So far , animal tests indicate that such a vaccine could prevent severe disease , although you might get a mild case .
So if this works in humans , what we &apos;re talking about is a universal flu vaccine , one that doesn &apos;t need to change every year and would remove the threat of death .
We really could think of flu , then , as just a bad cold .
Of course , the best vaccine imaginable is only valuable to the extent we get it to everyone who needs it .
So to do that , we have to combine smart vaccine design with smart production methods and , of course , smart delivery methods .
So I want you to think back a few months ago .
In June , the World Health Organization declared the first global flu pandemic in 41 years .
The U.S. government promised 150 million doses of vaccine by October 15th for the flu peak .
Vaccines were promised to developing countries .
Hundreds of millions of dollars were spent and flowed to accelerating vaccine manufacturing .
So what happened ?
Well , we first figured out how to make flu vaccines , how to produce them , in the early 1940s .
It was a slow , cumbersome process that depended on chicken eggs , millions of living chicken eggs .
Viruses only grow in living things , and so it turned out that , for flu , chicken eggs worked really well .
For most strains , you could get one to two doses of vaccine per egg .
Luckily for us , we live in an era of breathtaking biomedical advances .
So today , we get our flu vaccines from ...
chicken eggs , hundreds of millions of chicken eggs .
Almost nothing has changed .
The system is reliable but the problem is you never know how well a strain is going to grow .
This year &apos;s swine flu strain grew very poorly in early production : basically .6 doses per egg .
So , here &apos;s an alarming thought .
What if that wild bird flies by again ?
You could see an avian strain that would infect the poultry flocks , and then we would have no eggs for our vaccines .
So , Dan &#91; Barber &#93; , if you want billions of chicken pellets for your fish farm , I know where to get them .
So right now , the world can produce about 350 million doses of flu vaccine for the three strains , and we can up that to about 1.2 billion doses if we want to target a single variant like swine flu .
But this assumes that our factories are humming because , in 2004 , the U.S. supply was cut in half by contamination at one single plant .
And the process still takes more than half a year .
So are we better prepared than we were in 1918 ?
Well , with the new technologies emerging now , I hope we can say definitively , &quot; Yes . &quot;
Imagine we could produce enough flu vaccine for everyone in the entire world for less than half of what we &apos;re currently spending now in the United States .
With a range of new technologies , we could .
Here &apos;s an example : A company I &apos;m engaged with has found a specific piece of the H spike of flu that sparks the immune system .
If you lop this off and attach it to the tail of a different bacterium , which creates a vigorous immune response , they &apos;ve created a very powerful flu fighter .
This vaccine is so small it can be grown in a common bacteria , E. coli .
Now , as you know , bacteria reproduce quickly -- it &apos;s like making yogurt -- and so we could produce enough swine origin flu for the entire world in a few factories , in a few weeks , with no eggs , for a fraction of the cost of current methods .
So here &apos;s a comparison of several of these new vaccine technologies .
And , aside from the radically increased production and huge cost savings -- for example , the E. coli method I just talked about -- look at the time saved : this would be lives saved .
The developing world , mostly left out of the current response , sees the potential of these alternate technologies and they &apos;re leapfrogging the West .
India , Mexico and others are already making experimental flu vaccines , and they may be the first place we see these vaccines in use .
Because these technologies are so efficient and relatively cheap , billions of people can have access to lifesaving vaccines if we can figure out how to deliver them .
Now think of where this leads us .
New infectious diseases appear or reappear every few years .
Some day , perhaps soon , we &apos;ll have a virus that is going to threaten all of us .
Will we be quick enough to react before millions die ?
Luckily , this year &apos;s flu was relatively mild .
I say , &quot; luckily &quot; in part because virtually no one in the developing world was vaccinated .
So if we have the political and financial foresight to sustain our investments , we will master these and new tools of vaccinology , and with these tools we can produce enough vaccine for everyone at low cost and ensure healthy productive lives .
No longer must flu have to kill half a million people a year .
No longer does AIDS need to kill two million a year .
No longer do the poor and vulnerable need to be threatened by infectious diseases , or indeed , anybody .
Instead of having Vaclav Smil &apos;s &quot; massively fatal discontinuity &quot; of life , we can ensure the continuity of life .
What the world needs now are these new vaccines , and we can make it happen .
Thank you very much .
Thank you .
Thank you .
So , the science is changing .
In your mind , Seth -- I mean , you must dream about this -- what is the kind of time scale on , let &apos;s start with HIV , for a game-changing vaccine that &apos;s actually out there and usable ?
SB : The game change can come at any time , because the problem we have now is we &apos;ve shown we can get a vaccine to work in humans ; we just need a better one .
And with these types of antibodies , we know humans can make them .
So , if we can figure out how to do that , then we have the vaccine , and what &apos;s interesting is there already is some evidence that we &apos;re beginning to crack that problem .
So , the challenge is full speed ahead .
In your gut , do you think it &apos;s probably going to be at least another five years ?
SB : You know , everybody says it &apos;s 10 years , but it &apos;s been 10 years every 10 years .
So I hate to put a timeline on scientific innovation , but the investments that have occurred are now paying dividends .
And that &apos;s the same with universal flu vaccine , the same kind of thing ?
we &apos;ve got a bunch -- I just showed some of this -- a bunch of really cool and useful technologies that are ready to go now .
They look good . The problem has been that , what we did is we invested in traditional technologies because that &apos;s what we were comfortable with .
You also can use adjuvants , which are chemicals you mix .
That &apos;s what Europe is doing , so we could have diluted out our supply of flu and made more available , but , going back to what Michael Specter said , the anti-vaccine crowd didn &apos;t really want that to happen .
And malaria &apos;s even further behind ?
SB : No , malaria , there is a candidate that actually showed efficacy in an earlier trial and is currently in phase three trials now .
It probably isn &apos;t the perfect vaccine , but it &apos;s moving along .
Seth , most of us do work where every month , we produce something ; we get that kind of gratification .
You &apos;ve been slaving away at this for more than a decade , and I salute you and your colleagues for what you do .
The world needs people like you . Thank you .
SB : Thank you .

&lt; url &gt; http : / / www.ted.com / talks / helen _ fisher _ tells _ us _ why _ we _ love _ cheat.html &lt; / url &gt;
I &apos;d like to talk today about the two biggest social trends in the coming century , and perhaps in the next 10,000 years .
But I want to start with my work on romantic love , because that &apos;s my most recent work .
What I and my colleagues did was put 32 people , who were madly in love , into a functional MRI brain scanner .
17 who were madly in love and their love was accepted ; and 15 who were madly in love and they had just been dumped .
And so I want to tell you about that first , and then go on into where I think love is going .
&quot; What &apos; tis to love ? &quot; Shakespeare said .
I think our ancestors -- I think human beings have been wondering about this question since they sat around their campfires or lay and watched the stars a million years ago .
I started out by trying to figure out what romantic love was by looking at the last 45 years of research on -- just the psychological research -- and as it turns out , there &apos;s a very specific group of things that happen when you fall in love .
The first thing that happens is what I call -- a person begins to take on what I call , &quot; special meaning . &quot;
As a truck driver once said to me , he said , &quot; The world had a new center , and that center was Mary Anne . &quot;
George Bernard Shaw said it a little differently .
He said , &quot; Love consists of overestimating the differences between one woman and another . &quot;
And indeed , that &apos;s what we do .
And then you just focus on this person .
You can list what you don &apos;t like about them , but then you sweep that aside and focus on what you do .
As Chaucer said , &quot; Love is blind . &quot;
In trying to understand romantic love , I decided I would read poetry from all over the world , and I just want to give you one very short poem from eighth-century China , because it &apos;s an almost perfect example of a man who is focused totally on a particular woman .
It &apos;s a little bit like when you are madly in love with somebody and you walk into a parking lot -- their car is different from every other car in the parking lot .
Their wine glass at dinner is different from every other wine glass at the dinner party .
And in this case , a man got hooked on a bamboo sleeping mat .
And it goes like this . It &apos;s by a guy called Yuan Chen : &quot; I cannot bear to put away the bamboo sleeping mat .
The night I brought you home , I watched you roll it out . &quot;
He became hooked on a sleeping mat , probably because of elevated activity of dopamine in his brain , just like with you and me .
But anyway , not only does this person take on special meaning , you focus your attention on them .
You aggrandize them . But you have intense energy .
As one Polynesian said , he said , &quot; I felt like jumping in the sky . &quot;
You &apos;re up all night . You &apos;re walking till dawn .
You feel intense elation when things are going well ; mood swings into horrible despair when things are going poorly .
Real dependence on this person .
As one businessman in New York said to me , he said , &quot; Anything she liked , I liked . &quot;
Simple . Romantic love is very simple .
You become extremely sexually possessive .
You know , if you &apos;re just sleeping with somebody casually , you don &apos;t really care if they &apos;re sleeping with somebody else .
But the moment you fall in love , you become extremely sexually possessive of them .
I think that that is a Darwinian -- there &apos;s a Darwinian purpose to this .
The whole point of this is to pull two people together strongly enough to begin to rear babies as a team .
But the main characteristics of romantic love are craving : an intense craving to be with a particular person , not just sexually , but emotionally .
You &apos;d much rather -- it would be nice to go to bed with them , but you want them to call you on the telephone , to invite you out , etc . , to tell you that they love you .
The other main characteristic is motivation .
The motor in your brain begins to crank , and you want this person .
And last but not least , it is an obsession .
When I put these people in the machine , before I put them in the MRI machine , I would ask them all kinds of questions .
But my most important question was always the same .
It was : &quot; What percentage of the day and night do you think about this person ? &quot;
And indeed , they would say , &quot; All day . All night . I can never stop thinking about him or her . &quot;
And then , the very last question I would ask them -- I would always have to work myself up to this question , because I am not a psychologist .
I don &apos;t work with people in any kind of traumatic situation .
And my final question was always the same .
I would say , &quot; Would you die for him or her ? &quot;
And , indeed , these people would say &quot; Yes ! &quot;
as if I had asked them to pass the salt .
I was just staggered by it .
So we scanned their brains , looking at a photograph of their sweetheart and looking at a neutral photograph , with a distraction task in between .
So we could look at the same brain when it was in that heightened state and when it was in a resting state .
And we found activity in a lot of brain regions .
In fact , one of the most important was a brain region that becomes active when you feel the rush of cocaine .
And indeed , that &apos;s exactly what happens .
I began to realize that romantic love is not an emotion .
In fact , I had always thought it was a series of emotions , from very high to very low .
But actually , it &apos;s a drive . It comes from the motor of the mind , the wanting part of the mind , the craving part of the mind .
The kind of mind -- part of the mind -- when you &apos;re reaching for that piece of chocolate , when you want to win that promotion at work .
The motor of the brain . It &apos;s a drive .
And in fact , I think it &apos;s more powerful than the sex drive .
You know , if you ask somebody to go to bed with you , and they say , &quot; No , thank you , &quot; you certainly don &apos;t kill yourself or slip into a clinical depression .
But certainly , around the world , people who are rejected in love will kill for it .
People live for love . They kill for love . They die for love .
They have songs , poems , novels , sculptures , paintings , myths , legends .
In over 175 societies , people have left their evidence of this powerful brain system .
I have come to think it &apos;s one of the most powerful brain systems on earth for both great joy and great sorrow .
And I &apos;ve also come to think that it &apos;s one of three basically different brain systems that evolved from mating and reproduction .
One is the sex drive : the craving for sexual gratification .
W.H. Auden called it an &quot; intolerable neural itch , &quot; and indeed , that &apos;s what it is .
It keeps bothering you a little bit , like being hungry .
The second of these three brain systems is romantic love : that elation , obsession of early love .
And the third brain system is attachment : that sense of calm and security you can feel for a long-term partner .
And I think that the sex drive evolved to get you out there , looking for a whole range of partners .
You know , you can feel it when you &apos;re just driving along in your car .
It can be focused on nobody .
I think romantic love evolved to enable you to focus your mating energy on just one individual at a time , thereby conserving mating time and energy .
And I think that attachment , the third brain system , evolved to enable you to tolerate this human being -- -- at least long enough to raise a child together as a team .
So with that preamble , I want to go into discussing the two most profound social trends .
One of the last 10,000 years and the other , certainly of the last 25 years , that are going to have an impact on these three different brain systems : lust , romantic love and deep attachment to a partner .
The first is women working , moving into the workforce .
I &apos;ve looked at 130 societies through the demographic yearbooks of the United Nations .
And everywhere in the world , 129 out of 130 of them , women are not only moving into the job market -- sometimes very , very slowly , but they are moving into the job market -- and they are very slowly closing that gap between men and women in terms of economic power , health and education .
It &apos;s very slow .
For every trend on this planet , there &apos;s a counter-trend .
We all know of them , but nevertheless -- the Arabs say , &quot; The dogs may bark , but the caravan moves on . &quot;
And , indeed , that caravan is moving on .
Women are moving back into the job market .
And I say back into the job market , because this is not new .
For millions of years , on the grasslands of Africa , women commuted to work to gather their vegetables .
They came home with 60 to 80 percent of the evening meal .
The double income family was the standard .
And women were regarded as just as economically , socially and sexually powerful as men .
In short , we &apos;re really moving forward to the past .
Then , women &apos;s worst invention was the plow .
With the beginning of plow agriculture , men &apos;s roles became extremely powerful .
Women lost their ancient jobs as collectors , but then with the industrial revolution and the post-industrial revolution they &apos;re moving back into the job market .
In short , they are acquiring the status that they had a million years ago , 10,000 years ago , 100,000 years ago .
We are seeing now one of the most remarkable traditions in the history of the human animal .
And it &apos;s going to have an impact .
I generally give a whole lecture on the impact of women on the business community .
I &apos;ll only just say a couple of things , and then go on to sex and love .
There &apos;s a lot of gender differences ; anybody who thinks men and women are alike simply never had a boy and a girl child .
I don &apos;t know why it is that they want to think that men and women are alike .
There &apos;s much we have in common , but there &apos;s a whole lot that we do not have in common .
We are -- in the words of Ted Hughes , &quot; I think that we were built to be -- we &apos;re like two feet . We need each other to get ahead . &quot;
But we did not evolve to have the same brain .
And we &apos;re finding more and more and more gender differences in the brain .
I &apos;ll only just use a couple and then move on to sex and love .
One of them is women &apos;s verbal ability . Women can talk .
Women &apos;s ability to find the right word rapidly , basic articulation goes up in the middle of the menstrual cycle , when estrogen levels peak .
But even at menstruation , they &apos;re better than the average man .
Women can talk .
They &apos;ve been doing it for a million years ; words were women &apos;s tools .
They held that baby in front of their face , cajoling it , reprimanding it , educating it with words .
And , indeed , they &apos;re becoming a very powerful force .
Even in places like India and Japan , where women are not moving rapidly into the regular job market , they &apos;re moving into journalism .
And I think that the television is like the global campfire .
We sit around it and it shapes our minds .
Almost always , when I &apos;m on TV , the producers who call me , who negotiate what we &apos;re going to say , is a woman .
In fact , Solzhenitsyn once said , &quot; To have a great writer is to have another government . &quot;
Today 54 percent of people who are writers in America are women .
It &apos;s one of many , many characteristics that women have that they will bring into the job market .
They &apos;ve got incredible people skills , negotiating skills .
They &apos;re highly imaginative .
We now know the brain circuitry of imagination , of long-term planning .
They tend to be web thinkers .
Because the female parts of the brain are better connected , they tend to collect more pieces of data when they think , put them into more complex patterns , see more options and outcomes .
They tend to be contextual , holistic thinkers , what I call web thinkers .
Men tend to -- and these are averages -- tend to get rid of what they regard as extraneous , focus on what they do , and move in a more step-by-step thinking pattern .
They &apos;re both perfectly good ways of thinking .
We need both of them to get ahead .
In fact , there &apos;s many more male geniuses in the world .
When the -- and there &apos;s also many more male idiots in the world .
When the male brain works well , it works extremely well .
And what I really think that we &apos;re doing is , we &apos;re moving towards a collaborative society , a society in which the talents of both men and women are becoming understood and valued and employed .
But in fact , women moving into the job market is having a huge impact on sex and romance and family life .
Foremost , women are starting to express their sexuality .
I &apos;m always astonished when people come to me and say , &quot; Why is it that men are so adulterous ? &quot;
And I say , &quot; Why do you think more men are adulterous than women ? &quot;
&quot; Oh , well -- men are more adulterous ! &quot;
And I say , &quot; Who do you think these men are sleeping with ? &quot;
And -- basic math !
Anyway .
In the Western world , women start sooner at sex , have more partners , express less remorse for the partners that they do , marry later , have fewer children , leave bad marriages in order to get good ones .
We are seeing the rise of female sexual expression .
And , indeed , once again we &apos;re moving forward to the kind of sexual expression that we probably saw on the grasslands of Africa a million years ago , because this is the kind of sexual expression that we see in hunting and gathering societies today .
We &apos;re also returning to an ancient form of marriage equality .
They &apos;re now saying that the 21st century is going to be the century of what they call the &quot; symmetrical marriage , &quot; or the &quot; pure marriage , &quot; or the &quot; companionate marriage . &quot;
This is a marriage between equals , moving forward to a pattern that is highly compatible with the ancient human spirit .
We &apos;re also seeing a rise of romantic love .
91 percent of American women and 86 percent of American men would not marry somebody who had every single quality they were looking for in a partner , if they were not in love with that person .
People around the world , in a study of 37 societies , want to be in love with the person that they marry .
Indeed , arranged marriages are on their way off this braid of human life .
I even think that marriages might even become more stable because of the second great world trend .
The first one being women moving into the job market , the second one being the aging world population .
They &apos;re now saying that in America , that middle age should be regarded as up to age 85 .
Because in that highest age category of 76 to 85 , as much as 40 percent of people have nothing really wrong with them .
So we &apos;re seeing there &apos;s a real extension of middle age .
And I looked -- for one of my books , I looked at divorce data in 58 societies .
And as it turns out , the older you get , the less likely you are to divorce .
So the divorce rate right now is stable in America , and it &apos;s actually beginning to decline .
It may decline some more .
I would even say that with Viagra , estrogen replacement , hip replacements and the incredibly interesting women -- women have never been as interesting as they are now .
Not at any time on this planet have women been so educated , so interesting , so capable .
And so I honestly think that if there really was ever a time in human evolution when we have the opportunity to make good marriages , that time is now .
However , there &apos;s always kinds of complications in this .
In these three brain systems : lust , romantic love and attachment -- don &apos;t always go together .
They can go together , by the way .
That &apos;s why casual sex isn &apos;t so casual .
With orgasm you get a spike of dopamine .
Dopamine &apos;s associated with romantic love , and you can just fall in love with somebody who you &apos;re just having casual sex with .
With orgasm , then you get a real rush of oxytocin and vasopressin -- those are associated with attachment .
This is why you can feel such a sense of cosmic union with somebody after you &apos;ve made love to them .
But these three brain systems : lust , romantic love and attachment , aren &apos;t always connected to each other .
You can feel deep attachment to a long-term partner while you feel intense romantic love for somebody else , while you feel the sex drive for people unrelated to these other partners .
In short , we &apos;re capable of loving more than one person at a time .
In fact , you can lie in bed at night and swing from deep feelings of attachment for one person to deep feelings of romantic love for somebody else .
It &apos;s as if there &apos;s a committee meeting going on in your head as you are trying to decide what to do .
So I don &apos;t think , honestly , we &apos;re an animal that was built to be happy ; we are an animal that was built to reproduce .
I think the happiness we find , we make .
And I think , however , we can make good relationships with each other .
So I want to conclude with two things .
I want to conclude with a worry -- I have a worry -- and with a wonderful story .
The worry is about antidepressants .
Over 100 million prescriptions of antidepressants are written every year in the United States .
And these drugs are going generic .
They are seeping around the world .
I know one girl who &apos;s been on these antidepressants , serotonin-enhancing -- SSRI , serotonin-enhancing antidepressants -- since she was 13 .
She &apos;s 23 . She &apos;s been on them ever since she was 13 .
I &apos;ve got nothing against people who take them short term , when they &apos;re going through something perfectly horrible .
They want to commit suicide or kill somebody else .
I would recommend it .
But more and more people in the United States are taking them long term .
And indeed , what these drugs do is raise levels of serotonin .
And by raising levels of serotonin , you suppress the dopamine circuit .
Everybody knows that .
Dopamine is associated with romantic love .
Not only do they suppress the dopamine circuit , but they kill the sex drive .
And when you kill the sex drive , you kill orgasm .
And when you kill orgasm , you kill that flood of drugs associated with attachment .
The things are connected in the brain .
And when you tamper with one brain system , you &apos;re going to tamper with another .
I &apos;m just simply saying that a world without love is a deadly place .
So now -- -- thank you .
I want to end with a story . And then , just a comment .
I &apos;ve been studying romantic love and sex and attachment for 30 years .
I &apos;m an identical twin ; I am interested in why we &apos;re all alike .
Why you and I are alike , why the Iraqis and the Japanese and the Australian Aborigines and the people of the Amazon River are all alike .
And about a year ago , an Internet dating service , Match.com , came to me and asked me if I would design a new dating site for them .
I said , &quot; I don &apos;t know anything about personality . You know ?
I don &apos;t know . Do you think you &apos;ve got the right person ? &quot;
They said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
It got me thinking about why it is that you fall in love with one person rather than another .
That &apos;s my current project ; it will be my next book .
There &apos;s all kinds of reasons that you fall in love with one person rather than another .
Timing is important . Proximity is important .
Mystery is important . You fall in love with somebody who &apos;s somewhat mysterious , in part because mystery elevates dopamine in the brain , probably pushes you over that threshold to fall in love .
You fall in love with somebody who fits within what I call your &quot; love map , &quot; an unconscious list of traits that you build in childhood as you grow up .
And I also think that you gravitate to certain people , actually , with somewhat complementary brain systems .
And that &apos;s what I &apos;m now contributing to this .
But I want to tell you a story about -- to illustrate .
I &apos;ve been carrying on here about the biology of love .
I wanted to show you a little bit about the culture of it , too -- the magic of it .
It &apos;s a story that was told to me by somebody who had heard it just from one of the -- probably a true story .
It was a graduate student at -- I &apos;m at Rutgers and my two colleagues -- Art Aron is at SUNY Stony Brook .
That &apos;s where we put our people in the MRI machine .
And this graduate student was madly in love with another graduate student , and she was not in love with him .
And they were all at a conference in Beijing .
And he knew from our work that if you go and do something very novel with somebody , you can drive up the dopamine in the brain , and perhaps trigger this brain system for romantic love .
So he decided he &apos;d put science to work , and he invited this girl to go off on a rickshaw ride with him .
And sure enough -- I &apos;ve never been in one , but apparently they go all around the buses and the trucks and it &apos;s crazy and it &apos;s noisy and it &apos;s exciting .
And he figured that this would drive up the dopamine , and she would fall in love with him .
So off they go and she &apos;s squealing and squeezing him and laughing and having a wonderful time .
An hour later they get down off of the rickshaw , and she throws her hands up and she says , &quot; Wasn &apos;t that wonderful ? &quot;
And , &quot; Wasn &apos;t that rickshaw driver handsome ! &quot;
There &apos;s magic to love !
But I will end by saying that millions of years ago , we evolved three basic drives : the sex drive , romantic love and attachment to a long-term partner .
These circuits are deeply embedded in the human brain .
They &apos;re going to survive as long as our species survives on what Shakespeare called &quot; this mortal coil . &quot;
Thank you .

This is really a two-hour presentation I give to high school students , cut down to three minutes .
And it all started one day on a plane , on my way to TED , seven years ago .
And in the seat next to me was a high school student , a teenager , and she came from a really poor family .
And she wanted to make something of her life , and she asked me a simple little question .
She said , &quot; What leads to success ? &quot;
And I felt really badly , because I couldn &apos;t give her a good answer .
So I get off the plane , and I come to TED .
And I think , jeez , I &apos;m in the middle of a room of successful people !
So why don &apos;t I ask them what helped them succeed , and pass it on to kids ?
So here we are , seven years , 500 interviews later , and I &apos;m gonna tell you what really leads to success and makes TED-sters tick .
And the first thing is passion .
Freeman Thomas says , &quot; I &apos;m driven by my passion . &quot;
TED-sters do it for love ; they don &apos;t do it for money .
Carol Coletta says , &quot; I would pay someone to do what I do . &quot;
And the interesting thing is : if you do it for love , the money comes anyway .
Work ! Rupert Murdoch said to me , &quot; It &apos;s all hard work .
Nothing comes easily . But I have a lot of fun . &quot;
Did he say fun ? Rupert ? Yes !
TED-sters do have fun working . And they work hard .
I figured , they &apos;re not workaholics . They &apos;re workafrolics .
Good ! Alex Garden says , &quot; To be successful put your nose down in something and get damn good at it . &quot;
There &apos;s no magic ; it &apos;s practice , practice , practice .
And it &apos;s focus . Norman Jewison said to me , &quot; I think it all has to do with focusing yourself on one thing . &quot;
And push ! David Gallo says , &quot; Push yourself .
Physically , mentally , you &apos;ve gotta push , push , push . &quot;
You gotta push through shyness and self-doubt .
Goldie Hawn says , &quot; I always had self-doubts .
I wasn &apos;t good enough ; I wasn &apos;t smart enough .
I didn &apos;t think I &apos;d make it . &quot;
Now it &apos;s not always easy to push yourself , and that &apos;s why they invented mothers .
Frank Gehry -- Frank Gehry said to me , &quot; My mother pushed me . &quot;
Serve ! Sherwin Nuland says , &quot; It was a privilege to serve as a doctor . &quot;
Now a lot of kids tell me they want to be millionaires .
And the first thing I say to them is : &quot; OK , well you can &apos;t serve yourself ; you gotta serve others something of value .
Because that &apos;s the way people really get rich . &quot;
Ideas ! TED-ster Bill Gates says , &quot; I had an idea : founding the first micro-computer software company . &quot;
I &apos;d say it was a pretty good idea .
And there &apos;s no magic to creativity in coming up with ideas -- it &apos;s just doing some very simple things .
And I give lots of evidence .
Persist ! Joe Kraus says , &quot; Persistence is the number one reason for our success . &quot;
You gotta persist through failure . You gotta persist through crap !
Which of course means &quot; Criticism , Rejection , Assholes and Pressure . &quot;
So , the big -- the answer to this question is simple : Pay 4,000 bucks and come to TED .
Or failing that , do the eight things -- and trust me , these are the big eight things that lead to success .
Thank you TED-sters for all your interviews !

Last year at TED I gave an introduction to the LHC .
And I promised to come back and give you an update on how that machine worked .
So this is it . And for those of you that weren &apos;t there , the LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever attempted -- 27 kilometers in circumference .
Its job is to recreate the conditions that were present less than a billionth of a second after the universe began , up to 600 million times a second .
It &apos;s nothing if not ambitious .
This is the machine below Geneva .
We take the pictures of those mini-Big Bangs inside detectors .
This is the one I work on . It &apos;s called the ATLAS detector -- 44 meters wide , 22 meters in diameter .
Spectacular picture here of ATLAS under construction so you can see the scale .
On the 10th of September last year we turned the machine on for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLAS .
It caused immense celebration in the control room .
It &apos;s a picture of the first beam particle going all the way around the LHC , colliding with a piece of the LHC deliberately , and showering particles into the detector .
In other words , when we saw that picture on September 10th we knew the machine worked , which is a great triumph .
I don &apos;t know whether this got the biggest cheer , or this , when someone went onto Google and saw the front page was like that .
It means we made cultural impact as well as scientific impact .
About a week later we had a problem with the machine , related actually to these bits of wire here -- these gold wires .
Those wires carry 13 thousand amps when the machine is working in full power .
Now the engineers amongst you will look at them and say , &quot; No they don &apos;t . They &apos;re small wires . &quot;
They can do that because when they are very cold they are what &apos;s called superconducting wire .
So at minus 271 degrees , colder than the space between the stars , those wires can take that current .
In one of the joints between over 9,000 magnets in LHC , there was a manufacturing defect .
So the wire heated up slightly , and its 13,000 amps suddenly encountered electrical resistance .
This was the result .
Now that &apos;s more impressive when you consider those magnets weigh over 20 tons , and they moved about a foot .
So we damaged about 50 of the magnets .
We had to take them out , which we did .
We reconditioned them all , fixed them .
They &apos;re all on their way back underground now .
By the end of March the LHC will be intact again .
We will switch it on , and we expect to take data in June or July , and continue with our quest to find out what the building blocks of the universe are .
Now of course , in a way those accidents reignite the debate about the value of science and engineering at the edge . It &apos;s easy to refute .
I think that the fact that it &apos;s so difficult , the fact that we &apos;re overreaching , is the value of things like the LHC .
I will leave the final word to an English scientist , Humphrey Davy , who , I suspect , when defending his protege &apos;s useless experiments -- his protege was Michael Faraday -- said this , &quot; Nothing is so dangerous to the progress of the human mind than to assume that our views of science are ultimate , that there are no mysteries in nature , that our triumphs are complete , and that there are no new worlds to conquer . &quot;
Thank you .

&lt; title &gt; Brian Cox : What went wrong at the LHC &lt; / title &gt;

By the end of this year , there &apos;ll be nearly a billion people on this planet that actively use social networking sites .
The one thing that all of them have in common is that they &apos;re going to die .
While that might be a somewhat morbid thought , I think it has some really profound implications that are worth exploring .
What first got me thinking about this was a blog post authored earlier this year by Derek K. Miller , who was a science and technology journalist who died of cancer .
And what Miller did was have his family and friends write a post that went out shortly after he died .
Here &apos;s what he wrote in starting that out .
He said , &quot; Here it is . I &apos;m dead , and this is my last post to my blog .
In advance , I asked that once my body finally shut down from the punishments of my cancer , then my family and friends publish this prepared message I wrote -- the first part of the process of turning this from an active website to an archive . &quot;
Now , while as a journalist , Miller &apos;s archive may have been better written and more carefully curated than most , the fact of the matter is that all of us today are creating an archive that &apos;s something completely different than anything that &apos;s been created by any previous generation .
Consider a few stats for a moment .
Right now there are 48 hours of video being uploaded to YouTube every single minute .
There are 200 million Tweets being posted every day .
And the average Facebook user is creating 90 pieces of content each month .
So when you think about your parents or your grandparents , at best they may have created some photos or home videos , or a diary that lives in a box somewhere .
But today we &apos;re all creating this incredibly rich digital archive that &apos;s going to live in the cloud indefinitely , years after we &apos;re gone .
And I think that &apos;s going to create some incredibly intriguing opportunities for technologists .
Now to be clear , I &apos;m a journalist and not a technologist , so what I &apos;d like to do briefly is paint a picture of what the present and the future are going to look like .
Now we &apos;re already seeing some services that are designed to let us decide what happens to our online profile and our social media accounts after we die .
One of them actually , fittingly enough , found me when I checked into a deli at a restaurant in New York on foursquare .
Adam Ostrow : Hello .
Death : Adam ?
AO : Yeah .
Death : Death can catch you anywhere , anytime , even at the Organic .
AO : Who is this ?
Death : Go to ifidie.net before it &apos;s too late .
Adam Ostrow : Kind of creepy , right ?
So what that service does , quite simply , is let you create a message or a video that can be posted to Facebook after you die .
Another service right now is called 1,000 Memories .
And what this lets you do is create an online tribute to your loved ones , complete with photos and videos and stories that they can post after you die .
But what I think comes next is far more interesting .
Now a lot of you are probably familiar with Deb Roy who , back in March , demonstrated how he was able to analyze more than 90,000 hours of home video .
I think as machines &apos; ability to understand human language and process vast amounts of data continues to improve , it &apos;s going to become possible to analyze an entire life &apos;s worth of content -- the Tweets , the photos , the videos , the blog posts -- that we &apos;re producing in such massive numbers .
And I think as that happens , it &apos;s going to become possible for our digital personas to continue to interact in the real world long after we &apos;re gone thanks to the vastness of the amount of content we &apos;re creating and technology &apos;s ability to make sense of it all .
Now we &apos;re already starting to see some experiments here .
One service called My Next Tweet analyzes your entire Twitter stream , everything you &apos;ve posted onto Twitter , to make some predictions as to what you might say next .
Well right now , as you can see , the results can be somewhat comical .
You can imagine what something like this might look like five , 10 or 20 years from now as our technical capabilities improve .
Taking it a step further , MIT &apos;s media lab is working on robots that can interact more like humans .
But what if those robots were able to interact based on the unique characteristics of a specific person based on the hundreds of thousands of pieces of content that person produces in their lifetime ?
Finally , think back to this famous scene from election night 2008 back in the United States , where CNN beamed a live hologram of hip hop artist will.i.am into their studio for an interview with Anderson Cooper .
What if we were able to use that same type of technology to beam a representation of our loved ones into our living rooms -- interacting in a very lifelike way based on all the content they created while they were alive ?
I think that &apos;s going to become completely possible as the amount of data we &apos;re producing and technology &apos;s ability to understand it both expand exponentially .
Now in closing , I think what we all need to be thinking about is if we want that to become our reality -- and if so , what it means for a definition of life and everything that comes after it .
Thank you very much .

I was born in Switzerland and raised in Ghana , West Africa .
Ghana felt safe to me as a child .
I was free , I was happy .
The early 70s marked a time of musical and artistic excellence in Ghana .
But then by the end of the decade , the country had fallen back into political instability and mismanagement .
In 1979 , I witnessed my first military coup .
We the children had gathered at a friend &apos;s house .
It was a dimly lit shack .
There was a beaten up black and white television flickering in the background , and a former head of state and general was being blindfolded and tied to the pole .
The firing squad aimed , fired -- the general was dead .
Now this was being broadcast live .
And shortly after , we left the country , and we returned to Switzerland .
Now Europe came as a shock to me , and I think I started feeling the need to shed my skin in order to fit in .
I wanted to blend in like a chameleon .
I think it was a tactic of survival .
And it worked , or so I believed .
So here I was in 2008 wondering where I was in my life .
And I felt I was being typecast as an actor .
I was always playing the exotic African .
I was playing the violent African , the African terrorist .
And I was thinking , how many terrorists could I possibly play before turning into one myself ?
And I had become ashamed of the other , the African in me .
And fortunately I decided in 2008 to return to Ghana , after 28 years of absence .
I wanted to document on film the 2008 presidential elections .
And there , I started by searching for the footprints in my childhood .
And before I even knew it , I was suddenly on a stage surrounded by thousands of cheering people during a political rally .
And I realized that , when I &apos;d left the country , free and fair elections in a democratic environment were a dream .
And now that I &apos;d returned , that dream had become reality , though a fragile reality .
And I was thinking , was Ghana searching for its identity like I was looking for my identity ?
Was what was happening in Ghana a metaphor for what was happening in me ?
And it was as if through the standards of my Western life , I hadn &apos;t lived up to my full potential .
I mean , nor had Ghana , even though we had been trying very hard .
Now in 1957 , Ghana was the first sub-Saharan country to gain its independence .
In the late 50s , Ghana and Singapore had the same GDP .
I mean , today , Singapore is a First World country and Ghana is not .
But maybe it was time to prove to myself , yes , it &apos;s important to understand the past , it is important to look at it in a different light , but maybe we should look at the strengths in our own culture and build on those foundations in the present .
So here I was , December 7th , 2008 .
The polling stations opened to the voters at 7 : 00 AM , but voters , eager to take their own political fate into their hands , were starting to line up at 4 : 00 AM in the morning .
And they had traveled from near , they had traveled from far , because they wanted to make their voices heard .
And I asked one of the voters , I said , &quot; Whom are you going to vote for ? &quot;
And he said , &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I can &apos;t tell you . &quot;
He said that his vote was in his heart .
And I understood , this was their election , and they weren &apos;t going to let anyone take it away from them .
Now the first round of the voting didn &apos;t bring forth a clear winner -- so nobody had achieved the absolute majority -- so voting went into a second round three weeks later .
The candidates were back on the road ; they were campaigning .
The rhetoric of the candidates , of course , changed .
The heat was on .
And then the cliche came to haunt us .
There were claims of intimidation at the polling stations , of ballot boxes being stolen .
Inflated results started coming in and the mob was starting to get out of control .
We witnessed the eruption of violence in the streets .
People were being beaten brutally .
The army started firing their guns . People were scrambling .
It was complete chaos .
And my heart sank , because I thought , here we are again .
Here is another proof that the African is not capable of governing himself .
And not only that , I am documenting it -- documenting my own cultural shortcomings .
So when the echo of the gunshots had lingered , it was soon drowned by the chanting of the mob , and I didn &apos;t believe what I was hearing .
They were chanting , &quot; We want peace .
We want peace . &quot;
And I realized it had to come from the people .
After all , they decide , and they did .
So the sounds that were before distorted and loud , were suddenly a melody .
The sounds of the voices were harmonious .
So it could happen .
A democracy could be upheld peacefully .
It could be , by the will of the masses who were now urgently pressing with all their heart and all their will for peace .
Now here &apos;s an interesting comparison .
We in the West , we preach the values , the golden light of democracy , that we are the shining example of how it &apos;s done .
But when it comes down to it , Ghana found itself in the same place in which the U.S. election stalled in the 2000 presidential elections -- Bush versus Gore .
But instead of the unwillingness of the candidates to allow the system to proceed and the people to decide , Ghana honored democracy and its people .
It didn &apos;t leave it up to the Supreme Court to decide ; the people did .
Now the second round of voting did not bring forth a clear winner either .
I mean , it was so incredibly close .
The electoral commissioner declared , to run an unprecedented second re-run .
So the people went back to the polls to determine their own president , not the legal system .
And guess what , it worked .
The defeated candidate gave up power and made way for Ghana to move into a new democratic cycle .
I mean , at the absolute time for the absolute need of democracy , they did not abuse their power .
The belief in true democracy and in the people runs deep , proving that the African is capable of governing himself .
Now the uphill battle for Ghana and for Africa is not over , but I have proof that the other side of democracy exists , and that we must not take it for granted .
Now I have learned that my place is not just in the West or in Africa , and I &apos;m still searching for my identity , but I saw Ghana create democracy better .
Ghana taught me to look at people differently and to look at myself differently .
And yes , we Africans can .
Thank you .

Thank you so much , Chris . And it &apos;s truly a great honor to have the opportunity to come to this stage twice . I &apos;m extremely grateful .
I have been blown away by this conference , and I want to thank all of you for the many nice comments about what I had to say the other night .
And I say that sincerely , partly because -- -- I need that !
Put yourselves in my position !
I flew on Air Force Two for eight years .
Now I have to take off my shoes or boots to get on an airplane !
I &apos;ll tell you one quick story to illustrate what that &apos;s been like for me .
It &apos;s a true story -- every bit of this is true .
Soon after Tipper and I left the -- -- White House -- -- we were driving from our home in Nashville to a little farm we have 50 miles east of Nashville -- driving ourselves .
I know it sounds like a little thing to you , but -- -- I looked in the rearview mirror and all of a sudden it just hit me .
There was no motorcade back there .
You &apos;ve heard of phantom limb pain ?
This was a rented Ford Taurus . It was dinnertime , and we started looking for a place to eat .
We were on I-40 . We got to Exit 238 , Lebanon , Tennessee .
We got off the exit , started looking for a -- we found a Shoney &apos;s restaurant .
Low-cost family restaurant chain , for those of you who don &apos;t know it .
We went in and sat down at the booth , and the waitress came over , made a big commotion over Tipper .
She took our order , and then went to the couple in the booth next to us , and she lowered her voice so much I had to really strain to hear what she was saying .
She said &quot; Yes , that &apos;s former Vice President Al Gore and his wife Tipper . &quot;
And the man said , &quot; He &apos;s come down a long way , hasn &apos;t he ? &quot;
There &apos;s been kind of a series of epiphanies .
The very next day , continuing a totally true story , I got on a G-5 to fly to Africa to make a speech in Nigeria , in the city of Lagos , on the topic of energy .
I began the speech by telling them the story of what had just happened the day before in Nashville .
I told it pretty much the same way I &apos;ve just shared it with you : Tipper and I were driving ourselves , Shoney &apos;s , low-cost family restaurant chain , what the man said -- they laughed .
I gave my speech , then went back out to the airport to fly back home .
I fell asleep on the plane , until during the middle of the night , we landed on the Azores Islands for refueling .
I woke up , they opened the door , I went out to get some fresh air , and I looked and there was a man running across the runway .
And he was waving a piece of paper , and he was yelling , &quot; Call Washington ! Call Washington ! &quot;
And I thought to myself , in the middle of the night , in the middle of the Atlantic , what in the world could be wrong in Washington ?
Then I remembered it could be a bunch of things .
But what it turned out to be was that my staff was extremely upset because one of the wire services in Nigeria had already written a story about my speech .
And it had already been printed in cities all across the United States of America -- it was printed in Monterey , I checked . And the story began , &quot; Former Vice President Al Gore announced in Nigeria yesterday , &apos; My wife Tipper and I have opened a low-cost family restaurant , named Shoney &apos;s , and we are running it ourselves . &apos; &quot; Before I could get back to U.S. soil , David Letterman and Jay Leno had already started in on -- one of them had me in a big white chef &apos;s hat , Tipper was saying , &quot; One more burger , with fries ! &quot;
Three days later , I got a nice , long , handwritten letter from my friend and partner and colleague Bill Clinton saying , &quot; Congratulations on the new restaurant , Al ! &quot;
We like to celebrate each other &apos;s successes in life .
I was going to talk about information ecology .
But I was thinking that since I plan to make a lifelong habit of coming back to TED , that maybe I could talk about that another time .
It &apos;s a deal !
I want to focus on what many of you have said you would like me to elaborate on .
What can you do about the climate crisis ? I want to start with -- I &apos;m going to show some new images , and I &apos;m going to recapitulate just four or five .
Now , the slide show . I update the slide show every time I give it .
I add new images because I learn more about it every time I give it .
It &apos;s like beachcombing , you know ? Every time the tide comes in and out , you find some more shells .
Just in the last two days , we got the new temperature records in January .
This is just for the United States of America . Historical average for January is 31 degrees . Last month was 39.5 degrees .
Now , I know that you wanted some more bad news about the environment -- I &apos;m kidding -- but these are the recapitulation slides , and then I &apos;m going to go into new material about what you can do .
But I wanted to elaborate on a couple of these .
First of all , this is where we &apos;re projected to go with the U.S. contribution to global warming , under business as usual . Efficiency in end-use electricity and end-use of all energy is the low-hanging fruit . Efficiency and conservation : it &apos;s not a cost ; it &apos;s a profit . The sign is wrong .
It &apos;s not negative ; it &apos;s positive . These are investments that pay for themselves .
But they are also very effective in deflecting our path .
Cars and trucks -- I talked about that in the slideshow , but I want you to put it in perspective .
It &apos;s an easy , visible target of concern , and it should be , but there is more global warming pollution that comes from buildings than from cars and trucks .
Cars and trucks are very significant , and we have the lowest standards in the world , and so we should address that . But it &apos;s part of the puzzle .
Other transportation efficiency is as important as cars and trucks !
Renewables at the current levels of technological efficiency can make this much difference , and with what Vinod , and John Doerr , and others , many of you here -- a lot of people directly involved in this -- this wedge is going to grow much more rapidly than the current projection shows it .
Carbon Capture and Sequestration -- that &apos;s what CCS stands for -- is likely to become the killer app that will enable us to continue to use fossil fuels in a way that is safe .
Not quite there yet .
OK . Now , what can you do ? Reduce emissions in your home .
Most of these expenditures are also profitable .
Insulation , better design , buy green electricity where you can .
I mentioned automobiles -- buy a hybrid . Use light rail .
Figure out some of the other options that are much better . It &apos;s important .
Be a green consumer . You have choices with everything you buy , between things that have a harsh effect or a much less harsh effect on the global climate crisis .
Consider this . Make a decision to live a carbon-neutral life .
Those of you who are good at branding , I &apos;d love to get your advice and help on how to say this in a way that connects with the most people .
It is easier than you think . It really is .
A lot of us in here have made that decision and it is really pretty easy .
It means : reduce your carbon dioxide emissions with the full range of choices that you make , and then purchase or acquire offsets for the remainder that you have not completely reduced . And what it means is elaborated at climatecrisis.net.
There is a carbon calculator . Participant Productions convened , with my active involvement , the leading software writers in the world on this arcane science of carbon calculation to construct a consumer-friendly carbon calculator .
You can very precisely calculate what your CO2 emissions are , and then you will be given options to reduce .
And by the time the movie comes out in May , this will be updated to 2.0 and we will have click-through purchases of offsets .
Next , consider making your business carbon-neutral . Again , some of us have done that , and it &apos;s not as hard as you think . Integrate climate solutions into all of your innovations , whether you are from the technology , or entertainment , or design and architecture community .
Invest sustainably . Majora mentioned this .
Listen , if you have invested money with managers who you compensate on the basis of their annual performance , don &apos;t ever again complain about quarterly report CEO management .
Over time , people do what you pay them to do . And if they judge how much they &apos;re going to get paid on your capital that they &apos;ve invested , based on the short-term returns , you &apos;re going to get short-term decisions .
A lot more to be said about that .
Become a catalyst of change . Teach others ; learn about it ; talk about it .
The movie comes out -- the movie is a movie version of the slideshow I gave two nights ago , except it &apos;s a lot more entertaining . And it comes out in May .
Many of you here have the opportunity to ensure that a lot of people see it .
Consider sending somebody to Nashville . Pick well .
And I am personally going to train people to give this slideshow , re-purposed , with some of the personal stories obviously replaced with a generic approach , and -- it &apos;s not just the slides , it &apos;s what they mean . And it &apos;s how they link together .
And so I &apos;m going to be conducting a course this summer for a group of people that are nominated by different folks to come and then give it , en masse , in communities all across the country , and we &apos;re going to update the slideshow for all of them every single week to keep it right on the cutting edge .
Working with Larry Lessig , it will be , somewhere in that process , posted with tools and limited-use copyrights , so that young people can remix it and do it in their own way .
Where did anybody get the idea that you ought to stay arm &apos;s length from politics ?
It doesn &apos;t mean that if you are a Republican that I &apos;m trying to convince you to be a Democrat . We need Republicans as well . This used to be a bipartisan issue , and I know that in this group it really is . Become politically active .
Make our democracy work the way it &apos;s supposed to work .
Support the idea of capping carbon dioxide emissions , global warming pollution , and trading it . Here &apos;s why : as long as the United States is out of the world system , it &apos;s not a closed system .
Once it becomes a closed system , with U.S. participation , then everybody who &apos;s on a board of directors -- how many people here serve on the board of directors of a corporation ?
Once it &apos;s a closed system , you will have legal liability if you do not urge your CEO to get the maximum income from reducing and trading the carbon emissions that can be avoided . The market will work to solve this problem if we can accomplish this .
Help with the mass persuasion campaign that will start this spring .
We have to change the minds of the American people . Because presently the politicians do not have permission to do what needs to be done .
And in our modern country , the role of logic and reason no longer includes mediating between wealth and power the way it once did .
It &apos;s now repetition of short , hot-button , 30-second , 28-second television ads .
We have to buy a lot of those ads .
Let &apos;s rebrand global warming , as many of you have suggested .
I like &quot; climate crisis &quot; instead of &quot; climate collapse , &quot; but again , those of you who are good at branding , I need your help on this .
Somebody said the test we &apos;re facing now , a scientist told me , is whether the combination of an opposable thumb and a neocortex is a viable combination .
That &apos;s really true . I said the other night , and I &apos;ll repeat now : this is not a political issue .
Again , the Republicans here , this shouldn &apos;t be partisan .
You have more influence than some of us who are Democrats do .
This is an opportunity . Not just this , but connected to the ideas that are here , to bring more coherence to them .
We are one .
Thank you very much , I appreciate it .

&lt; url &gt; http : / / www.ted.com / talks / murray _ gell _ mann _ on _ the _ ancestor _ of _ language.html &lt; / url &gt;
Well , I &apos;m involved in other things , besides physics .
In fact , mostly now in other things .
One thing is distant relationships among human languages .
And the professional , historical linguists in the U.S.
and in Western Europe mostly try to stay away from any long-distance relationships , big groupings , groupings that go back a long time , longer than the familiar families .
They don &apos;t like that . They think it &apos;s crank . I don &apos;t think it &apos;s crank .
And there are some brilliant linguists , mostly Russians , who are working on that , at Santa Fe Institute and in Moscow , and I would love to see where that leads .
Does it really lead to a single ancestor some 20 , 25,000 years ago ?
And what if we go back beyond that single ancestor , when there was presumably a competition among many languages ?
How far back does that go ? How far back does modern language go ?
How many tens of thousands of years does it go back ?
Do you have a hunch or a hope for what the answer to that is ?
Murray Gell- Well , I would guess that modern language must be older than the cave paintings and cave engravings and cave sculptures and dance steps in the soft clay in the caves in Western Europe , in the Aurignacian Period some 35,000 years ago , or earlier .
I can &apos;t believe they did all those things and didn &apos;t also have a modern language .
So , I would guess that the actual origin goes back at least that far and maybe further .
But that doesn &apos;t mean that all , or many , or most of today &apos;s attested languages couldn &apos;t descend perhaps from one that &apos;s much younger than that , like say 20,000 years , or something of that kind . It &apos;s what we call a bottleneck .
Well , Philip Anderson may have been right .
You may just know more about everything than anyone .
So , it &apos;s been an honor . Thank you Murray Gell-Mann .

Pat Mitchell : You have brought us images from the Yemen Times .
And take us through those , and introduce us to another Yemen .
Nadia Al-Sakkaf : Well , I &apos;m glad to be here .
And I would like to share with you all some of the pictures that are happening today in Yemen .
This picture shows a revolution started by women , and it shows women and men leading a mixed protest .
The other picture is the popularity of the real need for change .
So many people are there .
The intensity of the upspring .
This picture shows that the revolution has allowed opportunities for training , for education .
These women are learning about first aid and their rights according to the constitution .
I love this picture .
I just wanted to show that over 60 percent of the Yemeni population are 15 years and below .
And they were excluded from decision-making , and now they are in the forefront of the news , raising the flag .
English -- you will see , this is jeans and tights , and an English expression -- the ability to share with the world what is going on in our own country .
And expression also , it has brought talents .
Yemenis are using cartoons and art , paintings , comics , to tell the world and each other about what &apos;s going on .
Obviously , there &apos;s always the dark side of it .
And this is just one of the less-gruesome pictures of the revolution and the cost that we have to pay .
The solidarity of millions of Yemenis across the country just demanding the one thing .
And finally , lots of people are saying that Yemen &apos;s revolution is going to break the country .
Is it going to be so many different countries ?
Is it going to be another Somalia ?
But we want to tell the world that , no , under the one flag , we &apos;ll still remain as Yemeni people .
PM : Thank you for those images , Nadia .
And they do , in many ways , tell a different story than the story of Yemen , the one that is often in the news .
And yet , you yourself defy all those characterizations .
So let &apos;s talk about the personal story for a moment .
Your father is murdered .
The Yemen Times already has a strong reputation in Yemen as an independent English language newspaper .
How did you then make the decision and assume the responsibilities of running a newspaper , especially in such times of conflict ?
N Well , let me first warn you that I &apos;m not the traditional Yemeni girl .
I &apos;ve guessed you &apos;ve already noticed this by now .
In Yemen , most women are veiled and they are sitting behind doors and not very much part of the public life .
But there &apos;s so much potential .
I wish I could show you my Yemen .
I wish you could see Yemen through my eyes .
Then you would know that there &apos;s so much to it .
And I was privileged because I was born into a family , my father would always encourage the boys and the girls .
He would say we are equal .
And he was such an extraordinary man .
And even my mother -- I owe it to my family .
A story : I studied in India .
And in my third year , I started becoming confused because I was Yemeni , but I was also mixing up with a lot of my friends in college .
And I went back home and I said , &quot; Daddy , I don &apos;t know who I am .
I &apos;m not a Yemeni ; I &apos;m not an Indian . &quot;
And he said , &quot; You are the bridge . &quot;
And that is something I will keep in my heart forever .
So since then I &apos;ve been the bridge , and a lot of people have walked over me .
PM : I don &apos;t think so .
N But it just helps tell that some people are change agents in the society .
And when I became editor-in-chief after my brother actually -- my father passed away in 1999 , and then my brother until 2005 -- and everybody was betting that I will not be able to do it .
&quot; What &apos;s this young girl coming in and showing off because it &apos;s her family business , &quot; or something .
It was very hard at first .
I didn &apos;t want to clash with people .
But with all due respect to all the men , and the older men especially , they did not want me around .
It was very hard , you know , to impose my authority .
But a woman &apos;s got to do what a woman &apos;s got to do .
And in the first year , I had to fire half of the men .
Brought in more women .
Brought in younger men .
And we have a more gender-balanced newsroom today .
The other thing is that it &apos;s about professionalism .
It &apos;s about proving who you are and what you can do .
And I don &apos;t know if I &apos;m going to be boasting now , but in 2006 alone , we won three international awards .
One of them is the IPI Free Media Pioneer Award .
So that was the answer to all the Yemeni people .
And I want to score a point here , because my husband is in the room over there .
If you could please stand up , &#91; unclear &#93; .
He has been very supportive of me .
PM : And we should point out that he works with you as well at the paper .
But in assuming this responsibility and going about it as you have , you have become a bridge between an older and traditional society and the one that you are now creating at the paper .
And so along with changing who worked there , you must have come up against another positioning that we always run into , in particular with women , and it has to do with outside image , dress , the veiled woman .
So how have you dealt with this on a personal level as well as the women who worked for you ?
N As you know , the image of a lot of Yemeni women is a lot of black and covered , veiled women .
And this is true .
And a lot of it is because women are not able , are not free , to show their face to their self .
It &apos;s a lot of traditional imposing coming by authority figures such as the men , the grandparents and so on .
And it &apos;s economic empowerment and the ability for a woman to say , &quot; I am as much contributing to this family , or more , than you are . &quot;
And the more empowered the women become , the more they are able to remove the veil , for example , or to drive their own car or to have a job or to be able to travel .
So the other face of Yemen is actually one that lies behind the veil , and it &apos;s economic empowerment mostly that allows the woman to just uncover it .
And I have done this throughout my work .
I &apos;ve tried to encourage young girls .
We started with , you can take it off in the office .
And then after that , you can take it off on assignments .
Because I didn &apos;t believe a journalist can be a journalist with -- how can you talk to people if you have your face covered ? -- and so on ; it &apos;s just a movement .
And I am a role model in Yemen .
A lot of people look up to me .
A lot of young girls look up to me .
And I need to prove to them that , yes , you can still be married , you can still be a mother , and you can still be respected within the society , but at the same time , that doesn &apos;t mean you &#91; should &#93; just be one of the crowd .
You can be yourself and have your face .
PM : But by putting yourself personally out there -- both projecting a different image of Yemeni women , but also what you have made possible for the women who work at the paper -- has this put you in personal danger ?
N Well the Yemen Times , across 20 years , has been through so much .
We &apos;ve suffered prosecution ; the paper was closed down more than three times .
It &apos;s an independent newspaper , but tell that to the people in charge .
They think that if there &apos;s anything against them , then we are being an opposition newspaper .
And very , very difficult times .
Some of my reporters were arrested .
We had some court cases .
My father was assassinated .
Today , we are in a much better situation .
We &apos;ve created the credibility .
And in times of revolution or change like today , it is very important for independent media to have a voice .
It &apos;s very important for you to go to YemenTimes.com , and it &apos;s very important to listen to our voice .
And this is probably something I &apos;m going to share with you in Western media probably -- and how there &apos;s a lot of stereotypes -- thinking of Yemen in one single frame : this is what Yemen is all about .
And that &apos;s not fair .
It &apos;s not fair for me ; it &apos;s not fair for my country .
A lot of reporters come to Yemen and they want to write a story on Al-Qaeda or terrorism .
And I just wanted to share with you : there &apos;s one reporter that came .
He wanted to do a documentary on what his editors wanted .
And he ended up writing about a story that even surprised me -- hip hop -- that there are young Yemeni men who express themselves through dancing and puchu puchu .
That thing .
Yeah , break dancing .
I &apos;m not so old .
I &apos;m just not in touch .
PM : Yes , you are .
Actually , that &apos;s a documentary that &apos;s available online ; the video &apos;s online .
N ShaketheDust.org.
PM : &quot; Shake the Dust . &quot;
PM : ShaketheDust.org.
And it definitely does give a different image of Yemen .
You spoke about the responsibility of the press .
And certainly , when we look at the ways in which we have separated ourselves from others and we &apos;ve created fear and danger , often from lack of knowledge , lack of real understanding , how do you see the way that the Western press in particular is covering this and all other stories out of the region , but in particular , in your country ?
N Well there is a saying that says , &quot; You fear what you don &apos;t know , and you hate what you fear . &quot;
So it &apos;s about the lack of research , basically .
It &apos;s almost , &quot; Do your homework , &quot; -- some involvement .
And you cannot do parachute reporting -- just jump into a country for two days and think that you &apos;ve done your homework and a story .
So I wish that the world would know my Yemen , my country , my people .
I am an example , and there are others like me .
We may not be that many , but if we are promoted as a good , positive example , there will be others -- men and women -- who can eventually bridge the gap -- again , coming to the bridge -- between Yemen and the world and telling first about recognition and then about communication and compassion .
I think Yemen is going to be in a very bad situation in the next two or three years .
It &apos;s natural .
But after the two years , which is a price we are willing to pay , we are going to stand up again on our feet , but in the new Yemen with a younger and more empowered people -- democratic .
PM : Nadia , I think you &apos;ve just given us a very different view of Yemen .
And certainly you yourself and what you do have given us a view of the future that we will embrace and be grateful for .
And the very best of luck to you .

Great creativity . In times of need , we need great creativity .
Discuss . Great creativity is astonishingly , absurdly , rationally , irrationally powerful .
Great creativity can spread tolerance , champion freedom , make education seem like a bright idea .
Great creativity can turn a spotlight on deprivation , or show that deprivation ain &apos;t necessarily so .
Great creativity can make politicians electable , or parties unelectable .
It can make war seem like tragedy or farce .
Creativity is the meme-maker that puts slogans on our t-shirts and phrases on our lips .
It &apos;s the pathfinder that shows us a simple road through an impenetrable moral maze .
Science is clever , but great creativity is something less knowable , more magical . And now we need that magic .
This is a time of need .
Our climate is changing quickly , too quickly .
And great creativity is needed to do what it does so well : to provoke us to think differently with dramatic creative statements .
To tempt us to act differently with delightful creative scraps .
Here is one such scrap from an initiative I &apos;m involved in using creativity to inspire people to be greener .
You know , rather than drive today , I &apos;m going to walk .
And so he walked , and as he walked he saw things .
Strange and wonderful things he would not otherwise have seen .
A deer with an itchy leg . A flying motorcycle .
A father and daughter separated from a bicycle by a mysterious wall .
And then he stopped . Walking in front of him was her .
The woman who as a child had skipped with him through fields and broken his heart .
Sure , she had aged a little .
In fact , she had aged a lot .
But he felt all his old passion for her return .
&quot; Ford , &quot; he called softly . For that was her name .
&quot; Don &apos;t say another word , Gusty , &quot; she said , for that was his name .
&quot; I know a tent next to a caravan , exactly 300 yards from here .
Let &apos;s go there and make love . In the tent . &quot;
Ford undressed . She spread one leg , and then the other .
Gusty entered her boldly and made love to her rhythmically while she filmed him , because she was a keen amateur pornographer .
The earth moved for both of them .
And they lived together happily ever after .
And all because he decided to walk that day .
Andy Hobsbawm : We &apos;ve got the science , we &apos;ve had the debate .
The moral imperative is on the table .
Great creativity is needed to take it all , make it simple and sharp .
To make it connect . To make it make people want to act .
So this is a call , a plea , to the incredibly talented TED community .
Let &apos;s get creative against climate change .
And let &apos;s do it soon . Thank you .

&lt; url &gt; http : / / www.ted.com / talks / nigel _ marsh _ how _ to _ make _ work _ life _ balance _ work.html &lt; / url &gt;
What I thought I would do is I would start with a simple request .
I &apos;d like all of you to pause for a moment , you wretched weaklings , and take stock of your miserable existence .
Now that was the advice that St. Benedict gave his rather startled followers in the fifth century .
It was the advice that I decided to follow myself when I turned 40 .
Up until that moment , I had been that classic corporate warrior -- I was eating too much , I was drinking too much , I was working too hard and I was neglecting the family .
And I decided that I would try and turn my life around .
In particular , I decided I would try to address the thorny issue of work-life balance .
So I stepped back from the workforce , and I spent a year at home with my wife and four young children .
But all I learned about work-life balance from that year was that I found it quite easy to balance work and life when I didn &apos;t have any work .
Not a very useful skill , especially when the money runs out .
So I went back to work , and I &apos;ve spent these seven years since struggling with , studying and writing about work-life balance .
And I have four observations I &apos;d like to share with you today .
The first is : if society &apos;s to make any progress on this issue , we need an honest debate .
But the trouble is so many people talk so much rubbish about work-life balance .
All the discussions about flexi-time or dress-down Fridays or paternity leave only serve to mask the core issue , which is that certain job and career choices are fundamentally incompatible with being meaningfully engaged on a day-to-day basis with a young family .
Now the first step in solving any problem is acknowledging the reality of the situation you &apos;re in .
And the reality of the society that we &apos;re in is there are thousands and thousands of people out there leading lives of quiet , screaming desperation , where they work long , hard hours at jobs they hate to enable them to buy things they don &apos;t need to impress people they don &apos;t like .
It &apos;s my contention that going to work on Friday in jeans and &#91; a &#93; T-shirt isn &apos;t really getting to the nub of the issue .
The second observation I &apos;d like to make is we need to face the truth that governments and corporations aren &apos;t going to solve this issue for us .
We should stop looking outside .
It &apos;s up to us as individuals to take control and responsibility for the type of lives that we want to lead .
If you don &apos;t design your life , someone else will design it for you , and you may just not like their idea of balance .
It &apos;s particularly important -- this isn &apos;t on the World Wide Web , is it ? I &apos;m about to get fired -- it &apos;s particularly important that you never put the quality of your life in the hands of a commercial corporation .
Now I &apos;m not talking here just about the bad companies -- the &quot; abattoirs of the human soul , &quot; as I call them .
I &apos;m talking about all companies .
Because commercial companies are inherently designed to get as much out of you &#91; as &#93; they can get away with .
It &apos;s in their nature ; it &apos;s in their DNA ; it &apos;s what they do -- even the good , well-intentioned companies .
On the one hand , putting childcare facilities in the workplace is wonderful and enlightened .
On the other hand , it &apos;s a nightmare -- it just means you spend more time at the bloody office .
We have to be responsible for setting and enforcing the boundaries that we want in our life .
The third observation is we have to be careful with the time frame that we choose upon which to judge our balance .
Before I went back to work after my year at home , I sat down and I wrote out a detailed , step-by-step description of the ideal balanced day that I aspired to .
And it went like this : wake up well rested after a good night &apos;s sleep .
Have sex .
Walk the dog .
Have breakfast with my wife and children .
Have sex again .
Drive the kids to school on the way to the office .
Do three hours &apos; work .
Play a sport with a friend at lunchtime .
Do another three hours &apos; work .
Meet some mates in the pub for an early evening drink .
Drive home for dinner with my wife and kids .
Meditate for half an hour .
Have sex .
Walk the dog . Have sex again .
Go to bed .
How often do you think I have that day ?
We need to be realistic .
You can &apos;t do it all in one day .
We need to elongate the time frame upon which we judge the balance in our life , but we need to elongate it without falling into the trap of the &quot; I &apos;ll have a life when I retire , when my kids have left home , when my wife has divorced me , my health is failing , I &apos;ve got no mates or interests left . &quot;
A day is too short ; &quot; after I retire &quot; is too long .
There &apos;s got to be a middle way .
A fourth observation : We need to approach balance in a balanced way .
A friend came to see me last year -- and she doesn &apos;t mind me telling this story -- a friend came to see me last year and said , &quot; Nigel , I &apos;ve read your book .
And I realize that my life is completely out of balance .
It &apos;s totally dominated by work .
I work 10 hours a day ; I commute two hours a day .
All of my relationships have failed .
There &apos;s nothing in my life apart from my work .
So I &apos;ve decided to get a grip and sort it out .
So I joined a gym . &quot;
Now I don &apos;t mean to mock , but being a fit 10-hour-a-day office rat isn &apos;t more balanced ; it &apos;s more fit .
Lovely though physical exercise may be , there are other parts to life -- there &apos;s the intellectual side ; there &apos;s the emotional side ; there &apos;s the spiritual side .
And to be balanced , I believe we have to attend to all of those areas -- not just do 50 stomach crunches .
Now that can be daunting .
Because people say , &quot; Bloody hell mate , I haven &apos;t got time to get fit .
You want me to go to church and call my mother . &quot;
And I understand .
I truly understand how that can be daunting .
But an incident that happened a couple of years ago gave me a new perspective .
My wife , who is somewhere in the audience today , called me up at the office and said , &quot; Nigel , you need to pick our youngest son &quot; -- Harry -- &quot; up from school . &quot;
Because she had to be somewhere else with the other three children for that evening .
So I left work an hour early that afternoon and picked Harry up at the school gates .
We walked down to the local park , messed around on the swings , played some silly games .
I then walked him up the hill to the local cafe , and we shared a pizza for two , then walked down the hill to our home , and I gave him his bath and put him in his Batman pajamas .
I then read him a chapter of Roald Dahl &apos;s &quot; James and the Giant Peach . &quot;
I then put him to bed , tucked him in , gave him a kiss on his forehead and said , &quot; Goodnight , mate , &quot; and walked out of his bedroom .
As I was walking out of his bedroom , he said , &quot; Dad ? &quot; I went , &quot; Yes , mate ? &quot;
He went , &quot; Dad , this has been the best day of my life , ever . &quot;
I hadn &apos;t done anything , hadn &apos;t taken him to Disney World or bought him a Playstation .
Now my point is the small things matter .
Being more balanced doesn &apos;t mean dramatic upheaval in your life .
With the smallest investment in the right places , you can radically transform the quality of your relationships and the quality of your life .
Moreover , I think , it can transform society .
Because if enough people do it , we can change society &apos;s definition of success away from the moronically simplistic notion that the person with the most money when he dies wins , to a more thoughtful and balanced definition of what a life well lived looks like .
And that , I think , is an idea worth spreading .

We are here today because &#91; the &#93; United Nations have defined goals for the progress of countries .
They &apos;re called Millennium Development Goals .
And the reason I really like these goals is that there are eight of them .
And by specifying eight different goals , the United Nations has said that there are so many things needed to change in a country in order to get the good life for people .
Look here -- you have to end poverty , education , gender , child and maternal health , control infections , protect the environment and get the good global links between nations in every aspect from aid to trade .
There &apos;s a second reason I like these development goals , and that is because each and every one is measured .
Take child mortality ; the aim here is to reduce child mortality by two-thirds , from 1990 to 2015 .
That &apos;s a four percent reduction per year -- and this , with measuring .
That &apos;s what makes the difference between political talking like this and really going for the important thing , a better life for people .
And what I &apos;m so happy about with this is that we have already documented that there are many countries in Asia , in the Middle East , in Latin America and East Europe that &#91; are &#93; reducing with this rate .
And even mighty Brazil is going down with five percent per year , and Turkey with seven percent per year .
So there &apos;s good news .
But then I hear people saying , &quot; There is no progress in Africa .
And there &apos;s not even statistics on Africa to know what is happening . &quot;
I &apos;ll prove them wrong on both points .
Come with me to the wonderful world of statistics .
I bring you to the webpage , ChildMortality.org , where you can take deaths in children below five years of age for all countries -- it &apos;s done by U.N. specialists .
And I will take Kenya as an example .
Here you see the data .
Don &apos;t panic -- don &apos;t panic now , I &apos;ll help you through this .
It looks nasty , like in college when you didn &apos;t like statistics .
But first thing , when you see dots like this , you have to ask yourself : from where do the data come ?
What is the origin of the data ?
Is it so that in Kenya , there are doctors and other specialists who write the death certificate at the death of the child and it &apos;s sent to the statistical office ?
No -- low-income countries like Kenya still don &apos;t have that level of organization .
It exists , but it &apos;s not complete because so many deaths occur in the home with the family , and it &apos;s not registered .
What we rely on is not an incomplete system .
We have interviews , we have surveys .
And this is highly professional female interviewers who sit down for one hour with a woman and ask her about &#91; her &#93; birth history .
How many children did you have ?
Are they alive ?
If they died , at what age and what year ?
And then this is done in a representative sample of thousands of women in the country and put together in what used to be called a demographic health survey report .
But these surveys are costly , so they can only be done &#91; in &#93; three- to five-year intervals .
But they have good quality .
So this is a limitation .
And all these colored lines here are results ; each color is one survey .
But that &apos;s too complicated for today , so I &apos;ll simplify it for you , and I give you one average point for each survey .
This was 1977 , 1988 , 1992 , &apos; 97 and 2002 .
And when the experts in the U.N.
have got these surveys in place in their database , then they use advanced mathematical formulas to produce a trend line , and the trend line looks like this .
See here -- it &apos;s the best fit they can get of this point .
But watch out -- they continue the line beyond the last point out into nothing .
And they estimated that in 2008 , Kenya had per child mortality of 128 .
And I was sad , because we could see this reversal in Kenya with an increased child mortality in the 90s .
It was so tragic .
But in June , I got a mail in my inbox from Demographic Health Surveys , and it showed good news from Kenya .
I was so happy .
This was the estimate of the new survey .
Then it just took another three months for &#91; the &#93; U.N. to get it into their server , and on Friday we got the new trend line -- it was down here .
Isn &apos;t it nice -- isn &apos;t it nice , yeah ?
I was actually , on Friday , sitting in front of my computer , and I saw the death rate fall from 128 to 84 just that morning .
So we celebrated .
But now , when you have this trend line , how do we measure progress ?
I &apos;m going into some details here , because &#91; the &#93; U.N. do it like this .
They start &#91; in &#93; 1990 -- they measure to 2009 .
They say , &quot; 0.9 percent , no progress . &quot;
That &apos;s unfair .
As a professor , I think I have the right to propose something differently .
I would say , at least do this -- 10 years is enough to follow the trend .
It &apos;s two surveys , and you can see what &apos;s happening now .
They have 2.4 percent .
Had I been in the Ministry of Health in Kenya , I may have joined these two points .
So what I &apos;m telling you is that we know the child mortality .
We have a decent trend .
It &apos;s coming into some tricky things then when we are measuring MDGs .
And the reason here for Africa is especially important , because &apos; 90s was a bad decade , not only in Kenya , but across Africa .
The HIV epidemic peaked .
There was resistance for the old malaria drugs , until we got the new drugs .
We got , later , the mosquito netting .
And there was socio-economic problems , which are now being solved at a much better scale .
So look at the average here -- this is the average for all of sub-Saharan Africa .
And &#91; the &#93; U.N. says it &apos;s a reduction with 1.8 percent .
Now this sounds a little theoretical , but it &apos;s not so theoretical .
You know , these economists , they love money , they want more and more of it , they want it to grow .
So they calculate the percent annual growth rate of &#91; the &#93; economy .
We in public health , we hate child death , so we want less and less and less of child deaths .
So we calculate the percent reduction per year , but it &apos;s sort of the same percentage .
If your economy grows with four percent , you ought to reduce child mortality four percent ; if it &apos;s used well and people are really involved and can get the use of the resources in the way they want it .
So is this fair now to measure this over 19 years ?
An economist would never do that .
I have just divided it into two periods .
In the 90s , only 1.2 percent , only 1.2 percent .
Whereas now , second gear -- it &apos;s like Africa had first gear , now they go into second gear .
But even this is not a fair representation of Africa , because it &apos;s an average , it &apos;s an average speed of reduction in Africa .
And look here when I take you into my bubble graphs .
Still here , child death per 1,000 on that axis .
Here we have &#91; the &#93; year .
And I &apos;m now giving you a wider picture than the MDG .
I start 50 years ago when Africa celebrated independence in most countries .
I give you Congo , which was high , Ghana -- lower . And Kenya -- even lower .
And what has happened over the years since then ? Here we go .
You can see , with independence , literacy improved and vaccinations started , smallpox was eradicated , hygiene was improved , and things got better .
But then , in the &apos; 80s , watch out here .
Congo got into civil war , and they leveled off here .
Ghana got very ahead , fast .
This was the backlash in Kenya , and Ghana bypassed , but then Kenya and Ghana go down together -- still a standstill in Congo .
That &apos;s where we are today .
You can see it doesn &apos;t make sense to make an average of this zero improvement and this very fast improvement .
Time has come to stop thinking about sub-Saharan Africa as one place .
Their countries are so different , and they merit to be recognized in the same way , as we don &apos;t talk about Europe as one place .
I can tell you that the economy in Greece and Sweden are very different -- everyone knows that .
And they are judged , each country , on how they are doing .
So let me show the wider picture .
My country , Sweden : 1800 , we were up there .
What a strange personality disorder we must have , counting the children so meticulously in spite of a high child death rate .
It &apos;s very strange . It &apos;s sort of embarrassing .
But we had that habit in Sweden , you know , that we counted all the child deaths , even if we didn &apos;t do anything about it .
And then , you see , these were famine years .
These were bad years , and people got fed up with Sweden .
My ancestors moved to the United States .
And eventually , soon they started to get better and better here .
And here we got better education , and we got health service , and child mortality came down .
We never had a war ; Sweden was in peace all this time .
But look , the rate of lowering in Sweden was not fast .
Sweden achieved a low child mortality because we started early .
We had primary school actually started in 1842 .
And then you get that wonderful effect when we got female literacy one generation later .
You have to realize that the investments we do in progress are long-term investments .
It &apos;s not about just five years -- it &apos;s long-term investments .
And Sweden never reached &#91; the &#93; Millennium Development Goal rate , 3.1 percent when I calculated .
So we are off track -- that &apos;s what Sweden is .
But you don &apos;t talk about it so much .
We want others to be better than we were , and indeed , others have been better .
Let me show you Thailand , see what a success story , Thailand from the 1960s -- how they went down here and reached almost the same child mortality levels as Sweden .
And I &apos;ll give you another story -- Egypt , the most hidden , glorious success in public health .
Egypt was up here in 1960 , higher than Congo .
The Nile Delta was a misery for children with diarrheal disease and malaria and a lot of problems .
And then they got the Aswan Dam . They got electricity in their homes , they increased education and they got primary health care .
And down they went , you know .
And they got safer water , they eradicated malaria .
And isn &apos;t it a success story .
Millennium Development Goal rates for child mortality is fully possible .
And the good thing is that Ghana today is going with the same rate as Egypt did at its fastest .
Kenya is now speeding up .
Here we have a problem .
We have a severe problem in countries which are at a standstill .
Now , let me now bring you to a wider picture , a wider picture of child mortality .
I &apos;m going to show you the relationship between child mortality on this axis here -- this axis here is child mortality -- and here I have the family size .
The relationship between child mortality and family size .
One , two , three , four children per woman : six , seven , eight children per woman .
This is , once again , 1960 -- 50 years ago .
Each bubble is a country -- the color , you can see , a continent .
The dark blue here is sub-Saharan Africa .
And the size of the bubble is the population .
And these are the so-called &quot; developing &quot; countries .
They had high , or very high , child mortality and family size , six to eight .
And the ones over there , they were so-called Western countries .
They had low child mortality and small families .
What has happened ?
What I want you &#91; to do &#93; now is to see with your own eyes the relation between fall in child mortality and decrease in family size .
I just want not to have any room for doubt -- you have to see that for yourself .
This is what happened . Now I start the world .
Here we come down with the eradication of smallpox , better education , health service .
It got down there -- China comes into the Western box here .
And here Brazil is in the Western Box .
India is approaching . The first African countries coming into the Western box , and we get a lot a new neighbors .
Welcome to a decent life .
Come on . We want everyone down there .
This is the vision we have , isn &apos;t it .
And look now , the first African countries here are coming in .
There we are today .
There is no such thing as a &quot; Western world &quot; and &quot; developing world . &quot;
This is the report from &#91; the &#93; U.N. , which came out on Friday .
It &apos;s very good -- &quot; Levels and Trends in Child Mortality &quot; -- except this page .
This page is very bad ; it &apos;s a categorization of countries .
It labels &quot; developing countries , &quot; -- I can read from the list here -- developing countries : Republic of Korea -- South Korea .
Huh ?
They get Samsung , how can they be &#91; a &#93; developing country ?
They have here Singapore .
They have the lowest child mortality in the world , Singapore .
They bypassed Sweden five years ago , and they are labeled a developing country .
They have here Qatar .
It &apos;s the richest country in the world with Al Jazeera .
How the heck could they be &#91; a &#93; developing country ?
This is crap .
The rest here is good -- the rest is good .
We have to have a modern concept , which fits to the data .
And we have to realize that we are all going to into this , down to here .
What is the importance now with the relations here .
Look -- even if we look in Africa -- these are the African countries .
You can clearly see the relation with falling child mortality and decreasing family size , even within Africa .
It &apos;s very clear that this is what happens .
And a very important piece of research came out on Friday from the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation in Seattle showing that almost 50 percent of the fall in child mortality can be attributed to female education .
That is , when we get girls in school , we &apos;ll get an impact 15 to 20 years later , which is a secular trend which is very strong .
That &apos;s why we must have that long-term perspective , but we must measure the impact over 10-year periods .
It &apos;s fully possible to get child mortality down in all of these countries and to get them down in the corner where we all would like to live together .
And of course , lowering child mortality is a matter of utmost importance from humanitarian aspects .
It &apos;s a decent life for children , we are talking about .
But it is also a strategic investment in the future of all mankind , because it &apos;s about the environment .
We will not be able to manage the environment and avoid the terrible climate crisis if we don &apos;t stabilize the world population .
Let &apos;s be clear about that .
And the way to do that , that is to get child mortality down , get access to family planning and behind that drive female education .
And that is fully possible . Let &apos;s do it .
Thank you very much .

Sadly , in the next 18 minutes when I do our chat , four Americans that are alive will be dead from the food that they eat .
My name &apos;s Jamie Oliver . I &apos;m 34 years old .
I &apos;m from Essex in England and for the last seven years I &apos;ve worked fairly tirelessly to save lives in my own way .
I &apos;m not a doctor ; I &apos;m a chef , I don &apos;t have expensive equipment or medicine .
I use information , education .
I profoundly believe that the power of food has a primal place in our homes that binds us to the best bits of life .
We have an awful , awful reality right now .
America , you &apos;re at the top of your game .
This is one of the most unhealthy countries in the world .
Can I please just see a raise of hands for how many of you have children in this room today ?
Please put your hands up .
Aunties , uncles , you can continue to put your hands up , aunties and uncles as well .
Most of you . OK .
We , the adults of the last four generations , have blessed our children with the destiny of a shorter lifespan than their own parents .
Your child will live a life ten years younger than you because of the landscape of food that we &apos;ve built around them .
Two-thirds of this room , today , in America , are statistically overweight or obese .
You lot , you &apos;re all right , but we &apos;ll get you eventually , don &apos;t worry .
Right ?
The statistics of bad health are clear , very clear .
We spend our lives being paranoid about death , murder , homicide , you name it ; it &apos;s on the front page of every paper , CNN .
Look at homicide at the bottom , for God &apos;s sake .
Right ?
Every single one of those in the red is a diet-related disease .
Any doctor , any specialist will tell you that .
Fact : Diet-related disease is the biggest killer in the United States , right now , here today .
This is a global problem .
It &apos;s a catastrophe .
It &apos;s sweeping the world .
England is right behind you , as usual .
I know they were close , but not that close .
We need a revolution .
Mexico , Australia , Germany , India , China , all have massive problems of obesity and bad health .
Think about smoking .
It costs way less than obesity now .
Obesity costs you Americans 10 percent of your healthcare bills , 150 billion dollars a year .
In 10 years , it &apos;s set to double : 300 billion dollars a year .
And let &apos;s be honest , guys , you ain &apos;t got that cash .
I came here to start a food revolution that I so profoundly believe in .
We need it . The time is now .
We &apos;re in a tipping-point moment .
I &apos;ve been doing this for seven years .
I &apos;ve been trying in America for seven years .
Now is the time when it &apos;s ripe -- ripe for the picking .
I went to the eye of the storm .
I went to West Virginia , the most unhealthy state in America .
Or it was last year .
We &apos;ve got a new one this year , but we &apos;ll work on that next season .
Huntington , West Virginia .
Beautiful town .
I wanted to put heart and soul and people , your public , around the statistics that we &apos;ve become so used to .
I want to introduce you to some of the people that I care about : your public , your children .
I want to show a picture of my friend Brittany .
She &apos;s 16 years old .
She &apos;s got six years to live because of the food that she &apos;s eaten .
She &apos;s the third generation of Americans that hasn &apos;t grown up within a food environment where they &apos;ve been taught to cook at home or in school , or her mom , or her mom &apos;s mom .
She has six years to live .
She &apos;s eating her liver to death .
Stacy , the Edwards family .
This is a normal family , guys .
Stacy does her best , but she &apos;s third-generation as well ; she was never taught to cook at home or in school .
The family &apos;s obese .
Justin here , 12 years old , he &apos;s 350 pounds .
He gets bullied , for God &apos;s sake .
The daughter there , Katie , she &apos;s four years old .
She &apos;s obese before she even gets to primary school .
Marissa , she &apos;s all right , she &apos;s one of your lot .
But you know what ? Her father , who was obese , died in her arms , And then the second most important man in her life , her uncle , died of obesity , and now her step-dad is obese .
You see , the thing is obesity and diet-related disease doesn &apos;t just hurt the people that have it ; it &apos;s all of their friends , families , brothers , sisters .
Pastor Steve : an inspirational man , one of my early allies in Huntington , West Virginia .
He &apos;s at the sharp knife-edge of this problem .
He has to bury the people , OK ?
And he &apos;s fed up with it . He &apos;s fed up with burying his friends , his family , his community .
Come winter , three times as many people die .
He &apos;s sick of it .
This is preventable disease . Waste of life .
By the way , this is what they get buried in .
We &apos;re not geared up to do this .
Can &apos;t even get them out the door -- and I &apos;m being serious -- can &apos;t even get them there . Forklift .
OK , I see it as a triangle , OK ?
This is our landscape of food .
I need you to understand it .
You &apos;ve probably heard all this before , but let &apos;s just go back over it .
Over the last 30 years , what &apos;s happened that &apos;s ripped the heart out of this country ?
Let &apos;s be frank and honest : Well , modern-day life .
Let &apos;s start with the Main Street .
Fast food has taken over the whole country ; we know that .
The big brands are some of the most important powers , powerful powers , in this country .
Supermarkets as well .
Big companies . Big companies .
Thirty years ago , most of the food was largely local and largely fresh .
Now it &apos;s largely processed and full of all sorts of additives , extra ingredients , and you know the rest of the story .
Portion size is obviously a massive , massive problem .
Labeling is a massive problem .
The labeling in this country is a disgrace .
They want to be self -- they want to self-police themselves .
The industry wants to self-police themselves .
What , in this kind of climate ? They don &apos;t deserve it .
How can you say something is low-fat when it &apos;s full of so much sugar ?
Home .
The biggest problem with the home is that used to be the heart of passing on food , food culture , what made our society .
That ain &apos;t happening anymore .
And you know , as we go to work and as life changes , and as life always evolves , we kind of have to look at it holistically -- step back for a moment , and re-address the balance .
It ain &apos;t happening , hasn &apos;t happened for 30 years , OK ?
I want to show you a situation that is very normal right now ; the Edwards family .
Jamie Oliver : Let &apos;s have a talk .
This stuff goes through you and your family &apos;s body every week .
And I need you to know that this is going to kill your children early .
How are you feeling ?
Stacy : Just feeling really sad and depressed right now .
But , you know , I want my kids to succeed in life and this isn &apos;t going to get them there .
But I &apos;m killing them .
JO : Yes you are . You are .
But we can stop that .
Normal . Let &apos;s get on schools , something that I &apos;m fairly much a specialist in .
OK , school .
What is school ? Who invented it ? What &apos;s the purpose of school ?
School was always invented to arm us with the tools to make us creative , do wonderful things , make us earn a living , etc . , etc . , etc .
You know , it &apos;s been kind of in this sort of tight box for a long , long time .
OK ?
But we haven &apos;t really evolved it to deal with the health catastrophes of America , OK ?
School food is something that most kids -- 31 million a day , actually -- have twice a day , more than often , breakfast and lunch , 180 days of the year .
So you could say that school food is quite important , really , judging the circumstances .
Before I crack into my rant , which I &apos;m sure you &apos;re waiting for ...
I need to say one thing , and it &apos;s so important in hopefully the magic that happens and unfolds in the next three months .
The lunch ladies , the lunch cooks of America -- I offer myself as their ambassador .
I &apos;m not slagging them off .
They &apos;re doing the best they can do .
They &apos;re doing their best .
But they &apos;re doing what they &apos;re told , and what they &apos;re being told to do is wrong .
The system is highly run by accountants ; there &apos;s not enough , or any , food-knowledgeable people in the business .
There &apos;s a problem : If you &apos;re not a food expert , and you &apos;ve got tight budgets and it &apos;s getting tighter , then you can &apos;t be creative , you can &apos;t duck and dive and write different things around things .
If you &apos;re an accountant , and a box-ticker , the only thing you can do in these circumstances is buy cheaper shit .
Now , the reality is , the food that your kids get every day is fast food , it &apos;s highly processed , there &apos;s not enough fresh food in there at all .
You know , the amount of additives , E numbers , ingredients you wouldn &apos;t believe -- there &apos;s not enough veggies at all . French fries are considered a vegetable .
Pizza for breakfast . They don &apos;t even get given crockery .
Knives and forks ? No , they &apos;re too dangerous .
They have scissors in the classroom , but knives and forks ? No .
And the way I look at it is : If you don &apos;t have knives and forks in your school , you &apos;re purely endorsing , from a state level , fast food , because it &apos;s handheld .
And yes , by the way , it is fast food : It &apos;s sloppy joes , it &apos;s burgers , it &apos;s wieners , it &apos;s pizzas , it &apos;s all of that stuff .
Ten percent of what we spend on healthcare , as I said earlier , is on obesity , and it &apos;s going to double .
We &apos;re not teaching our kids .
There &apos;s no statutory right to teach kids about food , elementary or secondary school . OK ?
We don &apos;t teach kids about food . Right ?
And this is a little clip from an elementary school , which is very common in England .
Who knows what this is ?
Potatoes . Jamie Oliver : Potato ? So , you think these are potatoes ?
Do you know what that is ?
Do you know what that is ? Broccoli ?
JO : What about this ? Our good old friend .
Do you know what this is , honey ? Celery .
JO : No . What do you think this is ? Onion . JO : Onion ? No .
Jamie Oliver : Immediately you get a really clear sense of : Do the kids know anything about where food comes from ?
JO : Who knows what that is ? Uh , pear ?
JO : What do you think this is ? I don &apos;t know .
JO : If the kids don &apos;t know what stuff is , then they will never eat it .
JO : Normal . England and America , England and America .
Guess what fixed that . Guess what fixed that : Two one-hour sessions .
We &apos;ve got to start teaching our kids about food in schools , period .
I want to tell you about something , I want to tell you about something that kind of epitomizes the trouble that we &apos;re in , guys . OK ?
I want to talk about something so basic as milk .
Every kid has the right to milk at school .
Your kids will be having milk at school , breakfast and lunch . Right ?
They &apos;ll be having two bottles . OK ?
And most kids do .
But milk ain &apos;t good enough anymore .
Because someone at the milk board , right -- and don &apos;t get me wrong , I support milk -- but someone at the milk board probably paid a lot of money for some geezer to work out that if you put loads of flavorings and colorings and sugar in milk , right , more kids will drink it . Yeah .
And obviously now that &apos;s going to catch on .
The apple board is going to work out that if they make toffee apples they &apos;ll eat more apples as well .
Do you know what I mean ?
For me , there ain &apos;t no need to flavor the milk .
Okay ? There &apos;s sugar in everything .
I know the ins and outs of those ingredients .
It &apos;s in everything . Even the milk hasn &apos;t escaped the kind of modern-day problems .
There &apos;s our milk . There &apos;s our carton .
In that is nearly as much sugar as one of your favorite cans of fizzy pop , and they are having two a day .
So , let me just show you .
We &apos;ve got one kid , here , having , you know , eight tablespoons of sugar a day .
You know , there &apos;s your week .
There &apos;s your month .
And I &apos;ve taken the liberty of putting in just the five years of elementary school sugar , just from milk .
Now , I don &apos;t know about you guys , but judging the circumstances , right , any judge in the whole world , would look at the statistics and the evidence , and they would find any government of old guilty of child abuse . That &apos;s my belief .
Now , if I came up here , and I wish I could come up here today and hang a cure for AIDS or cancer , you &apos;d be fighting and scrambling to get to me .
This , all this bad news , is preventable .
That &apos;s the good news .
It &apos;s very , very preventable .
So , let &apos;s just think about , we got a problem here , we need to reboot .
Okay so , in my world , what do we need to do ?
Here is the thing , right , it cannot just come from one source .
To reboot and make real tangible change , real change , so that I could look you in the white of the eyes and say , &quot; In 10 years time , the history of your children &apos;s lives , happiness -- and let &apos;s not forget , you &apos;re clever if you eat well , you know you &apos;re going to live longer -- all of that stuff , it will look different . OK ? &quot;
So , supermarkets .
Where else do you shop so religiously ?
Week in , week out .
How much money do you spend , in your life , in a supermarket ?
Love them . They just sell us what we want . All right .
They owe us , to put a food ambassador in every major supermarket .
They need to help us shop . They need to show us how to cook quick , tasty , seasonal meals for people that are busy .
This is not expensive .
It is done in some , and it needs to be done across the board in America soon , and quick .
The big brands , you know , the food brands , need to put food education at the heart of their businesses .
I know , easier said than done .
It &apos;s the future . It &apos;s the only way .
Fast food . With the fast-food industry you know , it &apos;s very competitive .
I &apos;ve had loads of secret papers and dealings with fast food restaurants .
I know how they do it .
I mean basically they &apos;ve weaned us on to these hits of sugar , salt and fat , and x , y , and z , and everyone loves them . Right ?
So , these guys are going to be part of the solution .
But we need to get the government to work with all of the fast food purveyors and the restaurant industry , and over a five , six , seven year period wean of us off the extreme amounts of fat , sugar , fat and all the other non-food ingredients .
Now , also , back to the sort of big brands : Labeling , I said earlier , is an absolute farce and has got to be sorted .
OK , school .
Obviously in schools we owe it to them to make sure those 180 days of the year , from that little precious age of four , til 18 , 20 , 24 , whatever , they need to be cooked proper , fresh food from local growers on site . OK ?
There needs to be a new standard of fresh , proper food for your children . Yeah ?
Under the circumstances , it &apos;s profoundly important that every single American child leaves school knowing how to cook 10 recipes that will save their life .
Life skills .
That means that they can be students , young parents , and be able to sort of duck and dive around the basics of cooking , no matter what recession hits them next time . If you can cook , recession money doesn &apos;t matter .
If you can cook , time doesn &apos;t matter .
The workplace , we haven &apos;t really talked about it .
You know , it &apos;s now time for corporate responsibility to really look at what they feed or make available to their staff .
The staff are the moms and dads of America &apos;s children .
Marissa , her father died in her hand , I think she &apos;d be quite happy if corporate America could start feeding their staff properly .
Definitely they shouldn &apos;t be left out .
Let &apos;s go back to the home .
Now , look , if we do all this stuff , and we can , it &apos;s so achievable . You can care and be commercial .
Absolutely .
But the home needs to start passing on cooking again , for sure .
For sure , pass it on as a philosophy .
And for me it &apos;s quite romantic , but it &apos;s about if one person teaches three people how to cook something , and they teach three of their mates , that only has to repeat itself 25 times , and that &apos;s the whole population of America .
Romantic , yes , but most importantly , it &apos;s about trying to get people to realize that every one of your individual efforts makes a difference .
We &apos;ve got to put back what &apos;s been lost .
Huntington &apos;s Kitchen . Huntington , where I made this program , you know , we &apos;ve got this prime-time program that hopefully will inspire people to really get on this change .
I truly believe that change will happen .
Huntington &apos;s Kitchen . I work with a community .
I worked in the schools . I found local sustainable funding to get every single school in the area , from the junk , onto the fresh food : six-and-a-half grand per school .
That &apos;s all it takes , six-and-a-half grand per school .
The Kitchen is 25 grand a month . Okay ?
This can do 5,000 people a year , which is 10 percent of their population , and it &apos;s people on people .
You know , it &apos;s local cooks teaching local people .
It &apos;s free cooking lessons , guys , free cooking lessons in the Main Street .
This is real , tangible change , real , tangible change .
Around America , if we just look back now , there is plenty of wonderful things going on .
There is plenty of beautiful things going on . There are angels around America doing great things in schools -- farm-to-school set-ups , garden set-ups , education -- there are amazing people doing this already .
The problem is they all want to roll out what they &apos;re doing to the next school , and the next , but there &apos;s no cash .
We need to recognize the experts and the angels quickly , identify them , and allow them to easily find the resource to keep rolling out what they &apos;re already doing , and doing well .
Businesses of America need to support Mrs. Obama to do the things that she wants to do .
And look , I know it &apos;s weird having an English person standing here before you talking about all this .
All I can say is : I care . I &apos;m a father , and I love this country , and I believe truly , actually , that if change can be made in this country , beautiful things will happen around the world . If America does it , I believe other people will follow .
It &apos;s incredibly important .
When I was in Huntington , trying to get a few things to work when they weren &apos;t , I thought &quot; If I had a magic wand , what would I do ? &quot; And I thought , &quot; You know what ?
I &apos;d just love to be put in front of some of the most amazing movers and shakers in America . &quot;
And a month later , TED phoned me up and gave me this award .
I &apos;m here .
So , my wish .
Dyslexic , so I &apos;m a bit slow .
My wish is for you to help a strong , sustainable movement to educate every child about food , to inspire families to cook again , and to empower people everywhere to fight obesity .
Thank you .

The universe is really big .
We live in a galaxy , the Milky Way Galaxy .
There are about a hundred billion stars in the Milky Way Galaxy .
And if you take a camera and you point it at a random part of the sky , and you just keep the shutter open , as long as your camera is attached to the Hubble Space Telescope , it will see something like this .
Every one of these little blobs is a galaxy roughly the size of our Milky Way -- a hundred billion stars in each of those blobs .
There are approximately a hundred billion galaxies in the observable universe .
100 billion is the only number you need to know .
The age of the universe , between now and the Big Bang , is a hundred billion in dog years .
Which tells you something about our place in the universe .
One thing you can do with a picture like this is simply admire it .
It &apos;s extremely beautiful .
I &apos;ve often wondered , what is the evolutionary pressure that made our ancestors in the Veldt adapt and evolve to really enjoy pictures of galaxies when they didn &apos;t have any .
But we would also like to understand it .
As a cosmologist , I want to ask , why is the universe like this ?
One big clue we have is that the universe is changing with time .
If you looked at one of these galaxies and measured its velocity , it would be moving away from you .
And if you look at a galaxy even farther away , it would be moving away faster .
So we say the universe is expanding .
What that means , of course , is that , in the past , things were closer together .
In the past , the universe was more dense , and it was also hotter .
If you squeeze things together , the temperature goes up .
That kind of makes sense to us .
The thing that doesn &apos;t make sense to us as much is that the universe , at early times , near the Big Bang , was also very , very smooth .
You might think that that &apos;s not a surprise .
The air in this room is very smooth .
You might say , &quot; Well , maybe things just smoothed themselves out . &quot;
But the conditions near the Big Bang are very , very different than the conditions of the air in this room .
In particular , things were a lot denser .
The gravitational pull of things was a lot stronger near the Big Bang .
What you have to think about is we have a universe with a hundred billion galaxies , a hundred billion stars each .
At early times , those hundred billion galaxies were squeezed into a region about this big -- literally -- at early times .
And you have to imagine doing that squeezing without any imperfections , without any little spots where there were a few more atoms than somewhere else .
Because if there had been , they would have collapsed under the gravitational pull into a huge black hole .
Keeping the universe very , very smooth at early times is not easy ; it &apos;s a delicate arrangement .
It &apos;s a clue that the early universe is not chosen randomly .
There is something that made it that way .
We would like to know what .
So part of our understanding of this was given to us by Ludwig Boltzmann , an Austrian physicist in the 19th century .
And Boltzmann &apos;s contribution was that he helped us understand entropy .
You &apos;ve heard of entropy .
It &apos;s the randomness , the disorder , the chaoticness of some systems .
Boltzmann gave us a formula -- engraved on his tombstone now -- that really quantifies what entropy is .
And it &apos;s basically just saying that entropy is the number of ways we can rearrange the constituents of a system so that you don &apos;t notice , so that macroscopically it looks the same .
If you have the air in this room , you don &apos;t notice each individual atom .
A low entropy configuration is one in which there &apos;s only a few arrangements that look that way .
A high entropy arrangement is one that there are many arrangements that look that way .
This is a crucially important insight because it helps us explain the second law of thermodynamics -- the law that says that entropy increases in the universe , or in some isolated bit of the universe .
The reason why entropy increases is simply because there are many more ways to be high entropy than to be low entropy .
That &apos;s a wonderful insight , but it leaves something out .
This insight that entropy increases , by the way , is what &apos;s behind what we call the arrow of time , the difference between the past and the future .
Every difference that there is between the past and the future is because entropy is increasing -- the fact that you can remember the past , but not the future .
The fact that you are born , and then you live , and then you die , always in that order , that &apos;s because entropy is increasing .
Boltzmann explained that if you start with low entropy , it &apos;s very natural for it to increase because there &apos;s more ways to be high entropy .
What he didn &apos;t explain was why the entropy was ever low in the first place .
The fact that the entropy of the universe was low was a reflection of the fact that the early universe was very , very smooth .
We &apos;d like to understand that .
That &apos;s our job as cosmologists .
Unfortunately , it &apos;s actually not a problem that we &apos;ve been giving enough attention to .
It &apos;s not one of the first things people would say , if you asked a modern cosmologist , &quot; What are the problems we &apos;re trying to address ? &quot;
One of the people who did understand that this was a problem was Richard Feynman .
50 years ago , he gave a series of a bunch of different lectures .
He gave the popular lectures that became &quot; The Character of Physical Law . &quot;
He gave lectures to Caltech undergrads that became &quot; The Feynman Lectures on Physics . &quot;
He gave lectures to Caltech graduate students that became &quot; The Feynman Lectures on Gravitation . &quot;
In every one of these books , every one of these sets of lectures , he emphasized this puzzle : Why did the early universe have such a small entropy ?
So he says -- I &apos;m not going to do the accent -- he says , &quot; For some reason , the universe , at one time , had a very low entropy for its energy content , and since then the entropy has increased .
The arrow of time cannot be completely understood until the mystery of the beginnings of the history of the universe are reduced still further from speculation to understanding . &quot;
So that &apos;s our job .
We want to know -- this is 50 years ago , &quot; Surely , &quot; you &apos;re thinking , &quot; we &apos;ve figured it out by now . &quot;
It &apos;s not true that we &apos;ve figured it out by now .
The reason the problem has gotten worse , rather than better , is because in 1998 we learned something crucial about the universe that we didn &apos;t know before .
We learned that it &apos;s accelerating .
The universe is not only expanding .
If you look at the galaxy , it &apos;s moving away .
If you come back a billion years later and look at it again , it will be moving away faster .
Individual galaxies are speeding away from us faster and faster so we say the universe is accelerating .
Unlike the low entropy of the early universe , even though we don &apos;t know the answer for this , we at least have a good theory that can explain it , if that theory is right , and that &apos;s the theory of dark energy .
It &apos;s just the idea that empty space itself has energy .
In every little cubic centimeter of space , whether or not there &apos;s stuff , whether or not there &apos;s particles , matter , radiation or whatever , there &apos;s still energy , even in the space itself .
And this energy , according to Einstein , exerts a push on the universe .
It is a perpetual impulse that pushes galaxies apart from each other .
Because dark energy , unlike matter or radiation , does not dilute away as the universe expands .
The amount of energy in each cubic centimeter remains the same , even as the universe gets bigger and bigger .
This has crucial implications for what the universe is going to do in the future .
For one thing , the universe will expand forever .
Back when I was your age , we didn &apos;t know what the universe was going to do .
Some people thought that the universe would recollapse in the future .
Einstein was fond of this idea .
But if there &apos;s dark energy , and the dark energy does not go away , the universe is just going to keep expanding forever and ever and ever .
14 billion years in the past , 100 billion dog years , but an infinite number of years into the future .
Meanwhile , for all intents and purposes , space looks finite to us .
Space may be finite or infinite , but because the universe is accelerating , there are parts of it we cannot see and never will see .
There &apos;s a finite region of space that we have access to , surrounded by a horizon .
So even though time goes on forever , space is limited to us .
Finally , empty space has a temperature .
In the 1970s , Stephen Hawking told us that a black hole , even though you think it &apos;s black , it actually emits radiation when you take into account quantum mechanics .
The curvature of space-time around the black hole brings to life the quantum mechanical fluctuation , and the black hole radiates .
A precisely similar calculation by Hawking and Gary Gibbons showed that if you have dark energy in empty space , then the whole universe radiates .
The energy of empty space brings to life quantum fluctuations .
And so even though the universe will last forever , and ordinary matter and radiation will dilute away , there will always be some radiation , some thermal fluctuations , even in empty space .
So what this means is that the universe is like a box of gas that lasts forever .
Well what is the implication of that ?
That implication was studied by Boltzmann back in the 19th century .
He said , well , entropy increases because there are many , many more ways for the universe to be high entropy , rather than low entropy .
But that &apos;s a probabilistic statement .
It will probably increase , and the probability is enormously huge .
It &apos;s not something you have to worry about -- the air in this room all gathering over one part of the room and suffocating us .
It &apos;s very , very unlikely .
Except if they locked the doors and kept us here literally forever , that would happen .
Everything that is allowed , every configuration that is allowed to be obtained by the molecules in this room , would eventually be obtained .
So Boltzmann says , look , you could start with a universe that was in thermal equilibrium .
He didn &apos;t know about the Big Bang . He didn &apos;t know about the expansion of the universe .
He thought that space and time were explained by Isaac Newton -- they were absolute ; they just stuck there forever .
So his idea of a natural universe was one in which the air molecules were just spread out evenly everywhere -- the everything molecules .
But if you &apos;re Boltzmann , you know that if you wait long enough , the random fluctuations of those molecules will occasionally bring them into lower entropy configurations .
And then , of course , in the natural course of things , they will expand back .
So it &apos;s not that entropy must always increase -- you can get fluctuations into lower entropy , more organized situations .
Well if that &apos;s true , Boltzmann then goes onto invent two very modern-sounding ideas -- the multiverse and the anthropic principle .
He says , the problem with thermal equilibrium is that we can &apos;t live there .
Remember , life itself depends on the arrow of time .
We would not be able to process information , metabolize , walk and talk , if we lived in thermal equilibrium .
So if you imagine a very , very big universe , an infinitely big universe , with randomly bumping into each other particles , there will occasionally be small fluctuations in the lower entropy states , and then they relax back .
But there will also be large fluctuations .
Occasionally , you will make a planet or a star or a galaxy or a hundred billion galaxies .
So Boltzmann says , we will only live in the part of the multiverse , in the part of this infinitely big set of fluctuating particles , where life is possible .
That &apos;s the region where entropy is low .
Maybe our universe is just one of those things that happens from time to time .
Now your homework assignment is to really think about this , to contemplate what it means .
Carl Sagan once famously said that &quot; in order to make an apple pie , you must first invent the universe . &quot;
But he was not right .
In Boltzmann &apos;s scenario , if you want to make an apple pie , you just wait for the random motion of atoms to make you an apple pie .
That will happen much more frequently than the random motions of atoms making you an apple orchard and some sugar and an oven , and then making you an apple pie .
So this scenario makes predictions .
And the predictions are that the fluctuations that make us are minimal .
Even if you imagine that this room we are in now exists and is real and here we are , and we have , not only our memories , but our impression that outside there &apos;s something called Caltech and the United States and the Milky Way Galaxy , it &apos;s much easier for all those impressions to randomly fluctuate into your brain than for them actually to randomly fluctuate into Caltech , the United States and the galaxy .
The good news is that , therefore , this scenario does not work ; it is not right .
This scenario predicts that we should be a minimal fluctuation .
Even if you left our galaxy out , you would not get a hundred billion other galaxies .
And Feynman also understood this .
Feynman says , &quot; From the hypothesis that the world is a fluctuation , all the predictions are that if we look at a part of the world we &apos;ve never seen before , we will find it mixed up , and not like the piece we &apos;ve just looked at -- high entropy .
If our order were due to a fluctuation , we would not expect order anywhere but where we have just noticed it .
We therefore conclude the universe is not a fluctuation . &quot;
So that &apos;s good . The question is then what is the right answer ?
If the universe is not a fluctuation , why did the early universe have a low entropy ?
And I would love to tell you the answer , but I &apos;m running out of time .
Here is the universe that we tell you about , versus the universe that really exists .
I just showed you this picture .
The universe is expanding for the last 10 billion years or so .
It &apos;s cooling off .
But we now know enough about the future of the universe to say a lot more .
If the dark energy remains around , the stars around us will use up their nuclear fuel , they will stop burning .
They will fall into black holes .
We will live in a universe with nothing in it but black holes .
That universe will last 10 to the 100 years -- a lot longer than our little universe has lived .
The future is much longer than the past .
But even black holes don &apos;t last forever .
They will evaporate , and we will be left with nothing but empty space .
That empty space lasts essentially forever .
However , you notice , since empty space gives off radiation , there &apos;s actually thermal fluctuations , and it cycles around all the different possible combinations of the degrees of freedom that exist in empty space .
So even though the universe lasts forever , there &apos;s only a finite number of things that can possibly happen in the universe .
They all happen over a period of time equal to 10 to the 10 to the 120 years .
So here &apos;s two questions for you .
Number one : If the universe lasts for 10 to the 10 to the 120 years , why are we born in the first 14 billion years of it , in the warm , comfortable afterglow of the Big Bang ?
Why aren &apos;t we in empty space ?
You might say , &quot; Well there &apos;s nothing there to be living , &quot; but that &apos;s not right .
You could be a random fluctuation out of the nothingness .
Why aren &apos;t you ?
More homework assignment for you .
So like I said , I don &apos;t actually know the answer .
I &apos;m going to give you my favorite scenario .
Either it &apos;s just like that . There is no explanation .
This is a brute fact about the universe that you should learn to accept and stop asking questions .
Or maybe the Big Bang is not the beginning of the universe .
An egg , an unbroken egg , is a low entropy configuration , and yet , when we open our refrigerator , we do not go , &quot; Hah , how surprising to find this low entropy configuration in our refrigerator . &quot;
That &apos;s because an egg is not a closed system ; it comes out of a chicken .
Maybe the universe comes out of a universal chicken .
Maybe there is something that naturally , through the growth of the laws of physics , gives rise to universe like ours in low entropy configurations .
If that &apos;s true , it would happen more than once ; we would be part of a much bigger multiverse .
That &apos;s my favorite scenario .
So the organizers asked me to end with a bold speculation .
My bold speculation is that I will be absolutely vindicated by history .
And 50 years from now , all of my current wild ideas will be accepted as truths by the scientific and external communities .
We will all believe that our little universe is just a small part of a much larger multiverse .
And even better , we will understand what happened at the Big Bang in terms of a theory that we will be able to compare to observations .
This is a prediction . I might be wrong .
But we &apos;ve been thinking as a human race about what the universe was like , why it came to be in the way it did for many , many years .
It &apos;s exciting to think we may finally know the answer someday .
Thank you .

Hawa Abdi : Many people -- 20 years for Somalia -- &#91; were &#93; fighting .
So there was no job , no food .
Children , most of them , became very malnourished , like this .
Deqo Mohamed : So as you know , always in a civil war , the ones affected most &#91; are &#93; the women and children .
So our patients are women and children .
And they are in our backyard .
It &apos;s our home . We welcome them .
That &apos;s the camp that we have in now 90,000 people , where 75 percent of them are women and children .
Pat Mitchell : And this is your hospital . This is the inside .
H We are doing C-sections and different operations because people need some help .
There is no government to protect them .
Every morning we have about 400 patients , maybe more or less .
But sometimes we are only five doctors and 16 nurses , and we are physically getting exhausted to see all of them .
But we take the severe ones , and we reschedule the other ones the next day .
It is very tough .
And as you can see , it &apos;s the women who are carrying the children ; it &apos;s the women who come into the hospitals ; it &apos;s the women &#91; are &#93; building the houses .
That &apos;s their house .
And we have a school . This is our bright -- we opened &#91; in the &#93; last two years &#91; an &#93; elementary school where we have 850 children , and the majority are women and girls .
PM : And the doctors have some very big rules about who can get treated at the clinic .
Would you explain the rules for admission ?
H The people who are coming to us , we are welcoming .
We are sharing with them whatever we have .
But there are only two rules .
First rule : there is no clan distinguished and political division in Somali society .
&#91; Whomever &#93; makes those things we throw out .
The second : no man can beat his wife .
If he beat , we will put &#91; him &#93; in jail , and we will call the eldest people .
Until they identify this case , we &apos;ll never release him .
That &apos;s our two rules .
The other thing that I have realized , that the woman is the most strong person all over the world .
Because the last 20 years , the Somali woman has stood up .
They were the leaders , and we are the leaders of our community and the hope of our future generations .
We are not just the helpless and the victims of the civil war .
We can reconcile .
We can do everything .
As my mother said , we are the future hope , and the men are only killing in Somalia .
So we came up with these two rules .
In a camp with 90,000 people , you have to come up with some rules or there is going to be some fights .
So there is no clan division , and no man can beat his wife .
And we have a little storage room where we converted a jail .
So if you beat your wife , you &apos;re going to be there .
So empowering the women and giving the opportunity -- we are there for them . They are not alone for this .
PM : You &apos;re running a medical clinic .
It brought much , much needed medical care to people who wouldn &apos;t get it .
You &apos;re also running a civil society .
You &apos;ve created your own rules , in which women and children are getting a different sense of security .
Talk to me about your decision , Dr. Abdi , and your decision , Dr. Mohamed , to work together -- for you to become a doctor and to work with your mother in these circumstances .
H My age -- because I was born in 1947 -- we were having , at that time , government , law and order .
But one day , I went to the hospital -- my mother was sick -- and I saw the hospital , how they &#91; were &#93; treating the doctors , how they &#91; are &#93; committed to help the sick people .
I admired them , and I decided to become a doctor .
My mother died , unfortunately , when I was 12 years &#91; old &#93; .
Then my father allowed me to proceed &#91; with &#93; my hope .
My mother died in &#91; a &#93; gynecology complication , so I decided to become a gynecology specialist .
That &apos;s why I became a doctor .
So Dr. Deqo has to explain .
For me , my mother was preparing &#91; me &#93; when I was a child to become a doctor , but I really didn &apos;t want to .
Maybe I should become an historian , or maybe a reporter .
I loved it , but it didn &apos;t work .
When the war broke out -- civil war -- I saw how my mother was helping and how she really needed the help , and how the care is essential to the woman to be a woman doctor in Somalia and help the women and children .
And I thought , maybe I can be a reporter and doctor gynecologist .
So I went to Russia , and my mother also , &#91; during the &#93; time of &#91; the &#93; Soviet Union .
So some of our character , maybe we will come with a strong Soviet background of training .
So that &apos;s how I decided &#91; to do &#93; the same .
My sister was different .
She &apos;s here . She &apos;s also a doctor .
She graduated in Russia also .
And to go back and to work with our mother is just what we saw in the civil war -- when I was 16 , and my sister was 11 , when the civil war broke out .
So it was the need and the people we saw in the early &apos; 90s -- that &apos;s what made us go back and work for them .
PM : So what is the biggest challenge working , mother and daughter , in such dangerous and sometimes scary situations ?
H Yes , I was working in a tough situation , very dangerous .
And when I saw the people who needed me , I was staying with them to help , because I &#91; could &#93; do something for them .
Most people fled abroad .
But I remained with those people , and I was trying to do something -- &#91; any &#93; little thing I &#91; could &#93; do .
I succeeded in my place .
Now my place is 90,000 people who are respecting each other , who are not fighting .
But we try to stand on our feet , to do something , little things , we can for our people .
And I &apos;m thankful for my daughters .
When they come to me , they help me to treat the people , to help .
They do everything for them .
They have done what I desire to do for them .
PM : What &apos;s the best part of working with your mother , and the most challenging part for you ?
She &apos;s very tough ; it &apos;s most challenging .
She always expects us to do more .
And really when you think &#91; you &#93; cannot do it , she will push you , and I can do it .
That &apos;s the best part .
She shows us , trains us how to do and how to be better &#91; people &#93; and how to do long hours in surgery -- 300 patients per day , 10 , 20 surgeries , and still you have to manage the camp -- that &apos;s how she trains us .
It is not like beautiful offices here , 20 patients , you &apos;re tired .
You see 300 patients , 20 surgeries and 90,000 people to manage .
PM : But you do it for good reasons .
Wait . Wait .
H Thank you .
Thank you .

&lt; url &gt; http : / / www.ted.com / talks / brene _ brown _ on _ vulnerability.html &lt; / url &gt;
So , I &apos;ll start with this : a couple years ago , an event planner called me because I was going to do a speaking event .
And she called , and she said , &quot; I &apos;m really struggling with how to write about you on the little flier . &quot;
And I thought , &quot; Well , what &apos;s the struggle ? &quot;
And she said , &quot; Well , I saw you speak , and I &apos;m going to call you a researcher , I think , but I &apos;m afraid if I call you a researcher , no one will come , because they &apos;ll think you &apos;re boring and irrelevant . &quot;
And I was like , &quot; Okay . &quot;
And she said , &quot; But the thing I liked about your talk is you &apos;re a storyteller .
So I think what I &apos;ll do is just call you a storyteller . &quot;
And of course , the academic , insecure part of me was like , &quot; You &apos;re going to call me a what ? &quot;
And she said , &quot; I &apos;m going to call you a storyteller . &quot;
And I was like , &quot; Why not magic pixie ? &quot;
I was like , &quot; Let me think about this for a second . &quot;
I tried to call deep on my courage .
And I thought , you know , I am a storyteller .
I &apos;m a qualitative researcher .
I collect stories ; that &apos;s what I do .
And maybe stories are just data with a soul .
And maybe I &apos;m just a storyteller .
And so I said , &quot; You know what ?
Why don &apos;t you just say I &apos;m a researcher-storyteller . &quot;
And she went , &quot; Haha . There &apos;s no such thing . &quot;
So I &apos;m a researcher-storyteller , and I &apos;m going to talk to you today -- we &apos;re talking about expanding perception -- and so I want to talk to you and tell some stories about a piece of my research that fundamentally expanded my perception and really actually changed the way that I live and love and work and parent .
And this is where my story starts .
When I was a young researcher , doctoral student , my first year I had a research professor who said to us , &quot; Here &apos;s the thing , if you cannot measure it , it does not exist . &quot;
And I thought he was just sweet-talking me .
I was like , &quot; Really ? &quot; and he was like , &quot; Absolutely . &quot;
And so you have to understand that I have a bachelor &apos;s in social work , a master &apos;s in social work , and I was getting my Ph.D. in social work , so my entire academic career was surrounded by people who kind of believed in the &quot; life &apos;s messy , love it . &quot;
And I &apos;m more of the , &quot; life &apos;s messy , clean it up , organize it and put it into a bento box . &quot;
And so to think that I had found my way , to found a career that takes me -- really , one of the big sayings in social work is , &quot; Lean into the discomfort of the work . &quot;
And I &apos;m like , knock discomfort upside the head and move it over and get all A &apos;s .
That was my mantra .
So I was very excited about this .
And so I thought , you know what , this is the career for me , because I am interested in some messy topics .
But I want to be able to make them not messy .
I want to understand them .
I want to hack into these things I know are important and lay the code out for everyone to see .
So where I started was with connection .
Because , by the time you &apos;re a social worker for 10 years , what you realize is that connection is why we &apos;re here .
It &apos;s what gives purpose and meaning to our lives .
This is what it &apos;s all about .
It doesn &apos;t matter whether you talk to people who work in social justice and mental health and abuse and neglect , what we know is that connection , the ability to feel connected , is -- neurobiologically that &apos;s how we &apos;re wired -- it &apos;s why we &apos;re here .
So I thought , you know what , I &apos;m going to start with connection .
Well , you know that situation where you get an evaluation from your boss , and she tells you 37 things you do really awesome , and one thing -- an &quot; opportunity for growth ? &quot;
And all you can think about is that opportunity for growth , right ?
Well , apparently this is the way my work went as well , because , when you ask people about love , they tell you about heartbreak .
When you ask people about belonging , they &apos;ll tell you their most excruciating experiences of being excluded .
And when you ask people about connection , the stories they told me were about disconnection .
So very quickly -- really about six weeks into this research -- I ran into this unnamed thing that absolutely unraveled connection in a way that I didn &apos;t understand or had never seen .
And so I pulled back out of the research and thought , I need to figure out what this is .
And it turned out to be shame .
And shame is really easily understood as the fear of disconnection : Is there something about me that , if other people know it or see it , that I won &apos;t be worthy of connection ?
The things I can tell you about it : it &apos;s universal ; we all have it .
The only people who don &apos;t experience shame have no capacity for human empathy or connection .
No one wants to talk about it , and the less you talk about it the more you have it .
What underpinned this shame , this &quot; I &apos;m not good enough , &quot; -- which we all know that feeling : &quot; I &apos;m not blank enough . I &apos;m not thin enough , rich enough , beautiful enough , smart enough , promoted enough . &quot;
The thing that underpinned this was excruciating vulnerability , this idea of , in order for connection to happen , we have to allow ourselves to be seen , really seen .
And you know how I feel about vulnerability . I hate vulnerability .
And so I thought , this is my chance to beat it back with my measuring stick .
I &apos;m going in , I &apos;m going to figure this stuff out , I &apos;m going to spend a year , I &apos;m going to totally deconstruct shame , I &apos;m going to understand how vulnerability works , and I &apos;m going to outsmart it .
So I was ready , and I was really excited .
As you know , it &apos;s not going to turn out well .
You know this .
So , I could tell you a lot about shame , but I &apos;d have to borrow everyone else &apos;s time .
But here &apos;s what I can tell you that it boils down to -- and this may be one of the most important things that I &apos;ve ever learned in the decade of doing this research .
My one year turned into six years : thousands of stories , hundreds of long interviews , focus groups .
At one point , people were sending me journal pages and sending me their stories -- thousands of pieces of data in six years .
And I kind of got a handle on it .
I kind of understood , this is what shame is , this is how it works .
I wrote a book , I published a theory , but something was not okay -- and what it was is that , if I roughly took the people I interviewed and divided them into people who really have a sense of worthiness -- that &apos;s what this comes down to , a sense of worthiness -- they have a strong sense of love and belonging -- and folks who struggle for it , and folks who are always wondering if they &apos;re good enough .
There was only one variable that separated the people who have a strong sense of love and belonging and the people who really struggle for it .
And that was , the people who have a strong sense of love and belonging believe they &apos;re worthy of love and belonging .
That &apos;s it .
They believe they &apos;re worthy .
And to me , the hard part of the one thing that keeps us out of connection is our fear that we &apos;re not worthy of connection , was something that , personally and professionally , I felt like I needed to understand better .
So what I did is I took all of the interviews where I saw worthiness , where I saw people living that way , and just looked at those .
What do these people have in common ?
I have a slight office supply addiction , but that &apos;s another talk .
So I had a manila folder , and I had a Sharpie , and I was like , what am I going to call this research ?
And the first words that came to my mind were whole-hearted .
These are whole-hearted people , living from this deep sense of worthiness .
So I wrote at the top of the manila folder , and I started looking at the data .
In fact , I did it first in a four-day very intensive data analysis , where I went back , pulled these interviews , pulled the stories , pulled the incidents .
What &apos;s the theme ? What &apos;s the pattern ?
My husband left town with the kids because I always go into this Jackson Pollock crazy thing , where I &apos;m just like writing and in my researcher mode .
And so here &apos;s what I found .
What they had in common was a sense of courage .
And I want to separate courage and bravery for you for a minute .
Courage , the original definition of courage , when it first came into the English language -- it &apos;s from the Latin word cor , meaning heart -- and the original definition was to tell the story of who you are with your whole heart .
And so these folks had , very simply , the courage to be imperfect .
They had the compassion to be kind to themselves first and then to others , because , as it turns out , we can &apos;t practice compassion with other people if we can &apos;t treat ourselves kindly .
And the last was they had connection , and -- this was the hard part -- as a result of authenticity , they were willing to let go of who they thought they should be in order to be who they were , which you have to absolutely do that for connection .
The other thing that they had in common was this : They fully embraced vulnerability .
They believed that what made them vulnerable made them beautiful .
They didn &apos;t talk about vulnerability being comfortable , nor did they really talk about it being excruciating -- as I had heard it earlier in the shame interviewing .
They just talked about it being necessary .
They talked about the willingness to say , &quot; I love you &quot; first , the willingness to do something where there are no guarantees , the willingness to breathe through waiting for the doctor to call after your mammogram .
They &apos;re willing to invest in a relationship that may or may not work out .
They thought this was fundamental .
I personally thought it was betrayal .
I could not believe I had pledged allegiance to research , where our job -- you know , the definition of research is to control and predict , to study phenomena , for the explicit reason to control and predict .
And now my mission to control and predict had turned up the answer that the way to live is with vulnerability and to stop controlling and predicting .
This led to a little breakdown -- -- which actually looked more like this .
And it did .
I call it a breakdown ; my therapist calls it a spiritual awakening .
A spiritual awakening sounds better than breakdown , but I assure you it was a breakdown .
And I had to put my data away and go find a therapist .
Let me tell you something : you know who you are when you call your friends and say , &quot; I think I need to see somebody .
Do you have any recommendations ? &quot;
Because about five of my friends were like , &quot; Wooo . I wouldn &apos;t want to be your therapist . &quot;
I was like , &quot; What does that mean ? &quot;
And they &apos;re like , &quot; I &apos;m just saying , you know .
Don &apos;t bring your measuring stick . &quot;
I was like , &quot; Okay . &quot;
So I found a therapist .
My first meeting with her , Diana -- I brought in my list of the way the whole-hearted live , and I sat down .
And she said , &quot; How are you ? &quot;
And I said , &quot; I &apos;m great . I &apos;m okay . &quot;
She said , &quot; What &apos;s going on ? &quot;
And this is a therapist who sees therapists , because we have to go to those , because their B.S. meters are good .
And so I said , &quot; Here &apos;s the thing , I &apos;m struggling . &quot;
And she said , &quot; What &apos;s the struggle ? &quot;
And I said , &quot; Well , I have a vulnerability issue .
And I know that vulnerability is the core of shame and fear and our struggle for worthiness , but it appears that it &apos;s also the birthplace of joy , of creativity , of belonging , of love .
And I think I have a problem , and I need some help . &quot;
And I said , &quot; But here &apos;s the thing : no family stuff , no childhood shit . &quot;
&quot; I just need some strategies . &quot;
Thank you .
So she goes like this .
And then I said , &quot; It &apos;s bad , right ? &quot;
And she said , &quot; It &apos;s neither good nor bad . &quot;
&quot; It just is what it is . &quot;
And I said , &quot; Oh my God , this is going to suck . &quot;
And it did , and it didn &apos;t .
And it took about a year .
And you know how there are people that , when they realize that vulnerability and tenderness are important , that they surrender and walk into it .
that &apos;s not me , and B : I don &apos;t even hang out with people like that .
For me , it was a yearlong street fight .
It was a slugfest .
Vulnerability pushed , I pushed back .
I lost the fight , but probably won my life back .
And so then I went back into the research and spent the next couple of years really trying to understand what they , the whole-hearted , what choices they were making , and what are we doing with vulnerability .
Why do we struggle with it so much ?
Am I alone in struggling with vulnerability ?
No .
So this is what I learned .
We numb vulnerability -- when we &apos;re waiting for the call .
It was funny , I sent something out on Twitter and on Facebook that says , &quot; How would you define vulnerability ?
What makes you feel vulnerable ? &quot;
And within an hour and a half , I had 150 responses .
Because I wanted to know what &apos;s out there .
Having to ask my husband for help because I &apos;m sick , and we &apos;re newly married ; initiating sex with my husband ; initiating sex with my wife ; being turned down ; asking someone out ; waiting for the doctor to call back ; getting laid off ; laying off people -- this is the world we live in .
We live in a vulnerable world .
And one of the ways we deal with it is we numb vulnerability .
And I think there &apos;s evidence -- and it &apos;s not the only reason this evidence exists , but I think it &apos;s a huge cause -- we are the most in-debt , obese , addicted and medicated adult cohort in U.S. history .
The problem is -- and I learned this from the research -- that you cannot selectively numb emotion .
You can &apos;t say , here &apos;s the bad stuff .
Here &apos;s vulnerability , here &apos;s grief , here &apos;s shame , here &apos;s fear , here &apos;s disappointment .
I don &apos;t want to feel these .
I &apos;m going to have a couple of beers and a banana nut muffin .
I don &apos;t want to feel these .
And I know that &apos;s knowing laughter .
I hack into your lives for a living .
God .
You can &apos;t numb those hard feelings without numbing the other affects , our emotions .
You cannot selectively numb .
So when we numb those , we numb joy , we numb gratitude , we numb happiness .
And then we are miserable , and we are looking for purpose and meaning , and then we feel vulnerable , so then we have a couple of beers and a banana nut muffin .
And it becomes this dangerous cycle .
One of the things that I think we need to think about is why and how we numb .
And it doesn &apos;t just have to be addiction .
The other thing we do is we make everything that &apos;s uncertain certain .
Religion has gone from a belief in faith and mystery to certainty .
I &apos;m right , you &apos;re wrong . Shut up .
That &apos;s it .
Just certain .
The more afraid we are , the more vulnerable we are , the more afraid we are .
This is what politics looks like today .
There &apos;s no discourse anymore .
There &apos;s no conversation .
There &apos;s just blame .
You know how blame is described in the research ?
A way to discharge pain and discomfort .
We perfect .
If there &apos;s anyone who wants their life to look like this , it would be me , but it doesn &apos;t work .
Because what we do is we take fat from our butts and put it in our cheeks .
Which just , I hope in 100 years , people will look back and go , &quot; Wow . &quot;
And we perfect , most dangerously , our children .
Let me tell you what we think about children .
They &apos;re hardwired for struggle when they get here .
And when you hold those perfect little babies in your hand , our job is not to say , &quot; Look at her , she &apos;s perfect .
My job is just to keep her perfect -- make sure she makes the tennis team by fifth grade and Yale by seventh grade . &quot;
That &apos;s not our job .
Our job is to look and say , &quot; You know what ? You &apos;re imperfect , and you &apos;re wired for struggle , but you are worthy of love and belonging . &quot;
That &apos;s our job .
Show me a generation of kids raised like that , and we &apos;ll end the problems I think that we see today .
We pretend that what we do doesn &apos;t have an effect on people .
We do that in our personal lives .
We do that corporate -- whether it &apos;s a bailout , an oil spill , a recall -- we pretend like what we &apos;re doing doesn &apos;t have a huge impact on other people .
I would say to companies , this is not our first rodeo , people .
We just need you to be authentic and real and say , &quot; We &apos;re sorry .
We &apos;ll fix it . &quot;
But there &apos;s another way , and I &apos;ll leave you with this .
This is what I have found : to let ourselves be seen , deeply seen , vulnerably seen ; to love with our whole hearts , even though there &apos;s no guarantee -- and that &apos;s really hard , and I can tell you as a parent , that &apos;s excruciatingly difficult -- to practice gratitude and joy in those moments of terror , when we &apos;re wondering , &quot; Can I love you this much ?
Can I believe in this this passionately ?
Can I be this fierce about this ? &quot;
just to be able to stop and , instead of catastrophizing what might happen , to say , &quot; I &apos;m just so grateful , because to feel this vulnerable means I &apos;m alive . &quot;
And the last , which I think is probably the most important , is to believe that we &apos;re enough .
Because when we work from a place , I believe , that says , &quot; I &apos;m enough , &quot; then we stop screaming and start listening , we &apos;re kinder and gentler to the people around us , and we &apos;re kinder and gentler to ourselves .
That &apos;s all I have . Thank you .

Hi , my name is Marcin -- farmer , technologist .
I was born in Poland , now in the U.S.
I started a group called Open Source Ecology .
We &apos;ve identified the 50 most important machines that we think it takes for modern life to exist -- things from tractors , bread ovens , circuit makers .
Then we set out to create an open source , DIY , do it yourself version that anyone can build and maintain at a fraction of the cost .
We call this the Global Village Construction Set .
So let me tell you a story .
So I finished my 20s with a Ph.D. in fusion energy , and I discovered I was useless .
I had no practical skills .
The world presented me with options , and I took them .
I guess you can call it the consumer lifestyle .
So I started a farm in Missouri and learned about the economics of farming .
I bought a tractor -- then it broke .
I paid to get it repaired -- then it broke again .
Then pretty soon , I was broke too .
I realized that the truly appropriate , low-cost tools that I needed to start a sustainable farm and settlement just didn &apos;t exist yet .
I needed tools that were robust , modular , highly efficient and optimized , low-cost , made from local and recycled materials that would last a lifetime , not designed for obsolescence .
I found that I would have to build them myself .
So I did just that .
And I tested them .
And I found that industrial productivity can be achieved on a small scale .
So then I published the 3D designs , schematics , instructional videos and budgets on a wiki .
Then contributors from all over the world began showing up , prototyping new machines during dedicated project visits .
So far , we have prototyped eight of the 50 machines .
And now the project is beginning to grow on its own .
We know that open source has succeeded with tools for managing knowledge and creativity .
And the same is starting to happen with hardware too .
We &apos;re focusing on hardware because it is hardware that can change people &apos;s lives in such tangible material ways .
If we can lower the barriers to farming , building , manufacturing , then we can unleash just massive amounts of human potential .
That &apos;s not only in the developing world .
Our tools are being made for the American farmer , builder , entrepreneur , maker .
We &apos;ve seen lots of excitement from these people , who can now start a construction business , parts manufacturing , organic CSA or just selling power back to the grid .
Our goal is a repository of published designs so clear , so complete , that a single burned DVD is effectively a civilization starter kit .
I &apos;ve planted a hundred trees in a day .
I &apos;ve pressed 5,000 bricks in one day from the dirt beneath my feet and built a tractor in six days .
From what I &apos;ve seen , this is only the beginning .
If this idea is truly sound , then the implications are significant .
A greater distribution of the means of production , environmentally sound supply chains , and a newly relevant DIY maker culture can hope to transcend artificial scarcity .
We &apos;re exploring the limits of what we all can do to make a better world with open hardware technology .
Thank you .

I want you to take a look at this baby .
What you &apos;re drawn to are her eyes and the skin you love to touch .
But today I &apos;m going to talk to you about something you can &apos;t see -- what &apos;s going on up in that little brain of hers .
The modern tools of neuroscience are demonstrating to us that what &apos;s going on up there is nothing short of rocket science .
And what we &apos;re learning is going to shed some light on what the romantic writers and poets described as the &quot; celestial openness &quot; of the child &apos;s mind .
What we see here is a mother in India , and she &apos;s speaking Koro , which is a newly discovered language .
And she &apos;s talking to her baby .
What this mother -- and the 800 people who speak Koro in the world -- understands &#91; is &#93; that , to preserve this language , they need to speak it to the babies .
And therein lies a critical puzzle .
Why is it that you can &apos;t preserve a language by speaking to you and I , to the adults ?
Well , it &apos;s got to do with your brain .
What we see here is that language has a critical period for learning .
The way to read this slide is to look at your age on the horizontal axis .
And you &apos;ll see on the vertical your skill at acquiring a second language .
Babies and children are geniuses until they turn seven , and then there &apos;s a systematic decline .
After puberty , we fall off the map .
No scientists dispute this curve , but laboratories all over the world are trying to figure out why it works this way .
Work in my lab is focused on the first critical period in development -- and that is the period in which babies try to master which sounds are used in their language .
We think , by studying how the sounds are learned , we &apos;ll have a model for the rest of language , and perhaps for critical periods that may exist in childhood for social , emotional and cognitive development .
So we &apos;ve been studying the babies using a technique that we &apos;re using all over the world and the sounds of all languages .
The baby sits on a parent &apos;s lap , and we train them to turn their heads when a sound changes -- like from &quot; ah &quot; to &quot; ee . &quot;
If they do so at the appropriate time , the black box lights up and a panda bear pounds a drum .
A six-monther adores the task .
What have we learned ?
Well , babies all over the world are what I like to describe as &quot; citizens of the world . &quot;
They can discriminate all the sounds of all languages , no matter what country we &apos;re testing and what language we &apos;re using , and that &apos;s remarkable because you and I can &apos;t do that .
We &apos;re culture-bound listeners .
We can discriminate the sounds of our own language , but not those of foreign languages .
So the question arises : when do those citizens of the world turn into the language-bound listeners that we are ?
And the answer : before their first birthdays .
What you see here is performance on that head-turn task for babies tested in Tokyo and the United States , here in Seattle , as they listened to &quot; ra &quot; and &quot; la &quot; -- sounds important to English , but not to Japanese .
So at six to eight months the babies are totally equivalent .
Two months later something incredible occurs .
The babies in the United States are getting a lot better , babies in Japan are getting a lot worse , but both of those groups of babies are preparing for exactly the language that they are going to learn .
So the question is : what &apos;s happening during this critical two-month period ?
This is the critical period for sound development , but what &apos;s going on up there ?
So there are two things going on .
The first is that the babies are listening intently to us , and they &apos;re taking statistics as they listen to us talk -- they &apos;re taking statistics .
So listen to two mothers speaking motherese -- the universal language we use when we talk to kids -- first in English and then in Japanese .
English Mother : Ah , I love your big blue eyes -- so pretty and nice .
Japanese Mother : &#91; Japanese &#93; Patricia Kuhl : During the production of speech , when babies listen , what they &apos;re doing is taking statistics on the language that they hear .
And those distributions grow .
And what we &apos;ve learned is that babies are sensitive to the statistics , and the statistics of Japanese and English are very , very different .
English has a lot of Rs and Ls .
The distribution shows .
And the distribution of Japanese is totally different , where we see a group of intermediate sounds , which is known as the Japanese &quot; R. &quot;
So babies absorb the statistics of the language and it changes their brains ; it changes them from the citizens of the world to the culture-bound listeners that we are .
But we as adults are no longer absorbing those statistics .
We &apos;re governed by the representations in memory that were formed early in development .
So what we &apos;re seeing here is changing our models of what the critical period is about .
We &apos;re arguing from a mathematical standpoint that the learning of language material may slow down when our distributions stabilize .
It &apos;s raising lots of questions about bilingual people .
Bilinguals must keep two sets of statistics in mind at once and flip between them , one after the other , depending on who they &apos;re speaking to .
So we asked ourselves , can the babies take statistics on a brand new language ?
And we tested this by exposing American babies who &apos;d never heard a second language to Mandarin for the first time during the critical period .
We knew that , when monolinguals were tested in Taipei and Seattle on the Mandarin sounds , they showed the same pattern .
Six to eight months , they &apos;re totally equivalent .
Two months later , something incredible happens .
But the Taiwanese babies are getting better , not the American babies .
What we did was expose American babies during this period to Mandarin .
It was like having Mandarin relatives come and visit for a month and move into your house and talk to the babies for 12 sessions .
Here &apos;s what it looked like in the laboratory .
Mandarin Speaker : &#91; Mandarin &#93; PK : So what have we done to their little brains ?
We had to run a control group to make sure that just coming into the laboratory didn &apos;t improve your Mandarin skills .
So a group of babies came in and listened to English .
And we can see from the graph that exposure to English didn &apos;t improve their Mandarin .
But look at what happened to the babies exposed to Mandarin for 12 sessions .
They were as good as the babies in Taiwan who &apos;d been listening for 10-and-a-half months .
What it demonstrated is that babies take statistics on a new language .
Whatever you put in front of them , they &apos;ll take statistics on .
But we wondered what role the human being played in this learning exercise .
So we ran another group of babies in which the kids got the same dosage , the same 12 sessions , but over a television set and another group of babies who had just audio exposure and looked at a teddy bear on the screen .
What did we do to their brains ?
What you see here is the audio result -- no learning whatsoever -- and the video result -- no learning whatsoever .
It takes a human being for babies to take their statistics .
The social brain is controlling when the babies are taking their statistics .
We want to get inside the brain and see this thing happening as babies are in front of televisions , as opposed to in front of human beings .
Thankfully , we have a new machine , magnetoencephalography , that allows us to do this .
It looks like a hair dryer from Mars .
But it &apos;s completely safe , completely non-invasive and silent .
We &apos;re looking at millimeter accuracy with regard to spatial and millisecond accuracy using 306 SQUIDs -- these are Superconducting QUantum Interference Devices -- to pick up the magnetic fields that change as we do our thinking .
We &apos;re the first in the world to record babies in an MEG machine while they are learning .
So this is little Emma .
She &apos;s a six-monther .
And she &apos;s listening to various languages in the earphones that are in her ears .
You can see , she can move around .
We &apos;re tracking her head with little pellets in a cap , so she &apos;s free to move completely unconstrained .
It &apos;s a technical tour de force .
What are we seeing ?
We &apos;re seeing the baby brain .
As the baby hears a word in her language the auditory areas light up , and then subsequently areas surrounding it that we think are related to coherence , getting the brain coordinated with its different areas , and causality , one brain area causing another to activate .
We are embarking on a grand and golden age of knowledge about child &apos;s brain development .
We &apos;re going to be able to see a child &apos;s brain as they experience an emotion , as they learn to speak and read , as they solve a math problem , as they have an idea .
And we &apos;re going to be able to invent brain-based interventions for children who have difficulty learning .
Just as the poets and writers described , we &apos;re going to be able to see , I think , that wondrous openness , utter and complete openness , of the mind of a child .
In investigating the child &apos;s brain , we &apos;re going to uncover deep truths about what it means to be human , and in the process , we may be able to help keep our own minds open to learning for our entire lives .
Thank you .

Hi there . I &apos;m Hasan . I &apos;m an artist .
And usually when I tell people I &apos;m an artist , they just look at me and say , &quot; Do you paint ? &quot;
or &quot; What kind of medium do you work in ? &quot;
Well most of my work that I work with is really a little bit about methodologies of working rather than actually a specific discipline or a specific technique .
So what I &apos;m really interested in is creative problem solving .
And I had a little bit of a problem a few years ago .
So let me show you a little of that .
So it started over here .
And this is the Detroit airport in June 19th of 2002 .
I was flying back to the U.S. from an exhibition overseas .
And as I was coming back , well I was taken by the FBI , met by an FBI agent , and went into a little room and he asked me all sorts of questions -- &quot; Where were you ? What were you doing ? Who were you talking with ?
Why were you there ? Who pays for your trips ? &quot; -- all these little details .
And then literally just out of nowhere , the guy asks me , &quot; Where were you September 12th ? &quot;
And when most of us get asked , &quot; Where were you September 12th ? &quot;
or any date for that fact , it &apos;s like , &quot; I don &apos;t exactly remember , but I can look it up for you . &quot;
So I pulled out my little PDA , and I said , &quot; Okay , let &apos;s look up my appointments for September 12th . &quot;
I had September 12th -- from 10 : 00 a.m. to 10 : 30 a.m. , I paid my storage bill .
From 10 : 30 a.m. to 12 : 00 p.m. , I met with Judith who was one of my graduate students at the time .
From 12 : 00 p.m. to 3 : 00 p.m. , I taught my intro class , 3 : 00 p.m. to 6 : 00 p.m. , I taught my advanced class .
&quot; Where were you the 11th ? &quot; &quot; Where were you the 10th ? &quot;
&quot; Where were you the 29th ? the 30th ? &quot;
&quot; Where were you October 5th ? &quot;
We read about six months of my calendar .
And I don &apos;t think he was expecting me to have such detailed records of what I did .
But good thing I did , because I don &apos;t look good in orange .
So he asked me -- &quot; So this storage unit that you paid the rent on , what did you have in it ? &quot;
This was in Tampa , Florida , so I was like , &quot; Winter clothes that I have no use for in Florida .
Furniture that I can &apos;t fit in my ratty apartment .
Just assorted garage sale junk , because I &apos;m a pack rat . &quot;
And he looks at me really confused and says , &quot; No explosives ? &quot;
I was like , &quot; No , no . I &apos;m pretty certain there were no explosives .
And if there were , I would have remembered that one . &quot;
And he &apos;s still a little confused , but I think that anyone who talks to me for more than a couple of minutes realizes I &apos;m not exactly a terrorist threat .
And so we &apos;re sitting there , and eventually after about an hour , hour and a half of just going back and forth , he says , &quot; Okay , I have enough information here .
I &apos;m going to pass this onto the Tampa office . They &apos;re the ones who initiated this .
They &apos;ll follow up with you , and we &apos;ll take care of it . &quot;
I was like , &quot; Great . &quot;
So I got home and the phone rings , and a man introduced himself .
Basically this is the FBI offices in Tampa where I spent six months of my life -- back and forth , not six months continuously .
By the way , you folks know that in the United States , you can &apos;t take photographs of federal buildings , but Google can do it for you .
So to the folks from Google , thank you .
So I spent a lot of time in this building .
Questions like : &quot; Have you ever witnessed or participated in any act that may be detrimental to the United States or a foreign nation ? &quot;
And you also have to consider the state of mind you &apos;re in when you &apos;re doing this .
You &apos;re basically face-to-face with someone that essentially decides life or death .
Or questions such as -- actually , during the polygraph , which was how it finally ended after nine consecutive of them -- one of the polygraph questions was ...
well the first one was , &quot; Is your name Hasan ? &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot;
&quot; Are we in Florida ? &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; Is today Tuesday ? &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot;
Because you have to base it on a yes or no .
Then , of course , the next question is : &quot; Do you belong to any groups that wish to harm the United States ? &quot;
I work at a university .
So I was like , &quot; Maybe you want to ask some of my colleagues that directly . &quot;
But they said , &quot; Okay , aside from what we had discussed , do you belong to any groups that wish to harm the United States ? &quot;
I was like , &quot; No . &quot;
So at the end of six months of this and nine consecutive polygraphs , they said , &quot; Hey , everything &apos;s fine . &quot;
I was like , &quot; I know . That &apos;s what I &apos;ve been trying to tell you guys all along .
I know everything &apos;s fine . &quot;
So they &apos;re looking at me really odd .
And it &apos;s like , &quot; Guys , I travel a lot . &quot;
This is with the FBI .
And I was like , &quot; All we need is Alaska not to get the last memo , and here we go all over again . &quot;
And there was a sincere concern there .
And he was like , &quot; You know , if you get into trouble , give us a call -- we &apos;ll take care of it . &quot;
So ever since then , before I would go anywhere , I would call the FBI .
I would tell them , &quot; Hey guys , this is where I &apos;m going . This is my flight .
Northwest flight seven coming into Seattle on March 12th &quot; or whatever .
A couple weeks later , I &apos;d call again , let them know .
It wasn &apos;t that I had to , but I chose to .
Just wanted to say , &quot; Hey guys .
Don &apos;t want to make it look like I &apos;m making any sudden moves . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t want you guys to think that I &apos;m about to flee .
Just letting you know . Heads up . &quot;
And so I just kept doing this over and over and over .
And then the phone calls turned into emails , and the emails got longer and longer and longer ...
with pictures , with travel tips .
Then I &apos;d make websites .
And then I built this over here . Let me go back to it over here .
So I actually designed this back in 2003 .
So this kind of tracks me at any given moment .
I wrote some code for my mobile phone .
Basically , what I decided is okay guys , you want to watch me , that &apos;s cool .
But I &apos;ll watch myself . It &apos;s okay .
You don &apos;t have to waste your energy or your resources .
And I &apos;ll help you out .
So in the process , I start thinking , well what else might they know about me ?
Well they probably have all my flight records , so I decided to put all my flight records from birth online .
So you can see , Delta 1252 going from Kansas City to Atlanta .
And then you see , these are some of the meals that I &apos;ve been fed on the planes .
This was on Delta 719 going from JFK to San Francisco .
See that ? They won &apos;t let me on a plane with that , but they &apos;ll give it to me on the plane .
These are the airports that I hang out in , because I like airports .
That &apos;s Kennedy airport , May 19th , Tuesday .
This is in Warsaw .
Singapore . You can see , they &apos;re kind of empty .
These images are shot really anonymously to the point where it could be anyone .
But if you can cross-reference this with the other data , then you &apos;re basically replaying the roll of the FBI agent and putting it all together .
And when you &apos;re in a situation where you have to justify every moment of your existence , you &apos;re put in the situation where you react in a very different manner .
At the time that this was going on , the last thing on my mind was &quot; art project . &quot;
I was certainly not thinking , hey , I got new work here .
But after going through this , after realizing , well what just happened ?
And after piecing together this , this and this , this way of actually trying to figure out what happened for myself eventually evolved into this , and it actually became this project .
So these are the stores that I shop in -- some of them -- because they need to know .
This is me buying some duck flavored paste at the Ranch 99 in Daly City on Sunday , November 15th .
At Coreana Supermarket buying my kimchi because I like kimchi .
And I bought some crabs too right around there , and some chitlins at the Safeway in Emoryville .
And laundry too . Laundry detergent at West Oakland -- East Oakland , sorry .
And then my pickled jellyfish at the Hong Kong Supermarket on Route 18 in East Brunswick .
Now if you go to my bank records , it &apos;ll actually show something from there , so you know that , on May 9th , that I bought $ 14.79 in fuel from Safeway Vallejo .
So not only that I &apos;m giving this information here and there , but now there &apos;s a third party , an independent third party , my bank , that &apos;s verifying that , yes indeed , I was there at this time .
So there &apos;s points , and these points are actually being cross-referenced .
And there &apos;s a verification taking place .
Sometimes they &apos;re really small purchases .
So 34 cents foreign transaction fee .
All of these are extracted directly from my bank accounts , and everything pops up right away .
Sometimes there &apos;s a lot of information .
This is exactly where my old apartment in San Francisco was .
And then sometimes you get this .
Sometimes you just get this , just an empty hallway in Salt Lake City , January 22nd .
And I can tell you exactly who I was with , where I was , because this is what I had to do with the FBI .
I had to tell them every little detail of everything .
I spend a lot of time on the road .
This is a parking lot in Elko , Nevada off of Route 80 at 8 : 01 p.m. on August 19th .
I spend a lot of time in gas stations too -- empty train stations .
So there &apos;s multiple databases .
And there &apos;s thousands and thousands and thousands of images .
There &apos;s actually 46,000 images right now on my site , and the FBI has seen all of them -- at least I trust they &apos;ve seen all of them .
And then sometimes you don &apos;t get much information at all , you just get this empty bed .
And sometimes you get a lot of text information and no visual information .
So you get something like this .
This , by the way , is the location of my favorite sandwich shop in California -- Vietnamese sandwich .
So there &apos;s different categorizations of meals eaten outside empty train stations , empty gas stations .
These are some of the meals that I &apos;ve been cooking at home .
So how do you know these are meals eaten at home ?
Well the same plate shows up a whole bunch of times .
So again , you have to do some detective work here .
So sometimes the databases get so specific .
These are all tacos eaten in Mexico City near a train station on July fifth to July sixth .
At 11 : 39 a.m. was this one .
At 1 : 56 p.m. was this one . At 4 : 59 p.m. was this one .
So I time-stamp my life every few moments .
Every few moments I shoot the image .
Now it &apos;s all done on my iPhone , and it all goes straight up to my server , and my server does all the backend work and categorizes things and puts everything together .
They need to know where I &apos;m doing my business , because they want to know about my business .
So on December 4th , I went here .
And on Sunday , June 14th at 2009 -- this was actually about two o &apos;clock in the afternoon in Skowhegan , Maine -- this was my apartment there .
So what you &apos;re basically seeing here is all bits and pieces and all this information .
If you go to my site , there &apos;s tons of things .
And really , it &apos;s not the most user-friendly interface .
It &apos;s actually quite user-unfriendly .
And one of the reasons , also being part of the user-unfriendliness , is that everything is there , but you have to really work through it .
So by me putting all this information out there , what I &apos;m basically telling you is I &apos;m telling you everything .
But in this barrage of noise that I &apos;m putting out , I actually live an incredibly anonymous and private life .
And you know very little about me actually .
And really so I &apos;ve come to the conclusion that the way you protect your privacy , particularly in an era where everything is cataloged and everything is archived and everything is recorded , there &apos;s no need to delete information anymore .
So what do you do when everything is out there ?
Well you have to take control over it .
And if I give you this information directly , it &apos;s a very different type of identity than if you were to try to go through and try to get bits and pieces .
The other thing that &apos;s also interesting that &apos;s going on here is the fact that intelligence agencies -- and it doesn &apos;t matter who they are -- they all operate in an industry where their commodity is information , or restricted access to information .
And the reason their information has any value is , well , because no one else has access to it .
And by me cutting out the middle man and giving it straight to you , the information that the FBI has has no value , so thus devaluing their currency .
And I understand that , on an individual level , it &apos;s purely symbolic .
But if 300 million people in the U.S.
started doing this , we would have to redesign the entire intelligence system from the ground up .
Because it just wouldn &apos;t work if everybody was sharing everything .
And we &apos;re getting to that .
When I first started this project , people were looking at me and saying , &quot; Why would you want to tell everybody what you &apos;re doing , where you &apos;re at ?
Why are you posting these photos ? &quot;
This was an age before people were Tweeting everywhere and 750 million people were posting status messages or poking people .
So in a way , I &apos;m glad that I &apos;m completely obsolete .
I &apos;m still doing this project , but it is obsolete , because you &apos;re all doing it .
This is something that we all are doing on a daily basis , whether we &apos;re aware of it or not .
So we &apos;re creating our own archives and so on .
And you know , some of my friends have always said , &quot; Hey , you &apos;re just paranoid . Why are you doing this ?
Because no one &apos;s really watching .
No one &apos;s really going to bother you . &quot;
So one of the things that I do is I actually look through my server logs very carefully .
Because it &apos;s about surveillance .
I &apos;m watching who &apos;s watching me .
And I came up with these .
So these are some of my sample logs .
And just little bits and pieces , and you can see some of the things there .
And I cleaned up the list a little bit so you can see .
So you can see that the Homeland Security likes to come by -- Department of Homeland Security .
You can see the National Security Agency likes to come by .
I actually moved very close to them . I live right down the street from them now .
Central Intelligence Agency .
Executive Office of the President .
Not really sure why they show up , but they do .
I think they kind of like to look at art .
And I &apos;m glad that we have patrons of the arts in these fields .
So thank you very much . I appreciate it .
Hasan , just curious .
You said , &quot; Now everything automatically goes from my iPhone , &quot; but actually you do take the pictures and put on information .
So how many hours of the day does that take ?
HE : Almost none .
It &apos;s no different than sending a text .
It &apos;s no different than checking an email .
It &apos;s one of those things , we got by just fine before we had to do any of those .
So it &apos;s just become another day .
I mean , when we update a status message , we don &apos;t really think about how long that &apos;s going to take .
So it &apos;s really just a matter of my phone clicking a couple of clicks , send , and then it &apos;s done .
And everything &apos;s automated at the other end .
On the day you are in a place where there is no coverage , the FBI gets crazy ?
HE : Well it goes to the last point that I was at .
So it holds onto the very last point .
So if I &apos;m on a 12-hour flight , you &apos;ll see the last airport that I departed from .
Hasan , thank you very much .

In the past several days , I heard people talking about China .
And also , I talked to friends about China and Chinese Internet .
Something is very challenging to me .
I want to make my friends understand : China is complicated .
So I always want to tell the story , like , one hand it is that , the other hand is that .
You can &apos;t just tell a one sided story .
I &apos;ll give an example . China is a BRIC country .
BRIC country means Brazil , Russia , India and China .
This emerging economy really is helping the revival of the world economy .
But at the same time , on the other hand , China is a SICK country , the terminology coined by Facebook IPO papers -- file .
He said the SICK country means Syria , Iran , China and North Korea .
The four countries have no access to Facebook .
So basically , China is a SICK BRIC country .
Another project was built up to watch China and Chinese Internet .
And now , today I want to tell you my personal observation in the past several years , from that wall .
So , if you are a fan of the Game of Thrones , you definitely know how important a big wall is for an old kingdom .
It prevents weird things from the north .
Same was true for China .
In the north , there was a great wall , Chang Cheng .
It protected China from invaders for 2,000 years .
But China also has a great firewall .
That &apos;s the biggest digital boundary in the whole world .
It &apos;s not only to defend the Chinese regime from overseas , from the universal values , but also to prevent China &apos;s own citizens to access the global free Internet , and even separate themselves into blocks , not united .
So , basically the &quot; Internet &quot; has two Internets .
One is the Internet , the other is the Chinanet .
But if you think the Chinanet is something like a deadland , wasteland , I think it &apos;s wrong .
But we also use a very simple metaphor , the cat and the mouse game , to describe in the past 15 years the continuing fight between Chinese censorship , government censorship , the cat , and the Chinese Internet users . That means us , the mouse .
But sometimes this kind of a metaphor is too simple .
So today I want to upgrade it to 2.0 version .
In China , we have 500 million Internet users .
That &apos;s the biggest population of Netizens , Internet users , in the whole world .
So even though China &apos;s is a totally censored Internet , but still , Chinese Internet society is really booming .
How to make it ? It &apos;s simple .
You have Google , we have Baidu .
You have Twitter , we have Weibo .
You have Facebook , we have Renren .
You have YouTube , we have Youku and Tudou .
The Chinese government blocked every single international Web 2.0 service , and we Chinese copycat every one .
So , that &apos;s the kind of the thing I call smart censorship .
That &apos;s not only to censor you .
Sometimes this Chinese national Internet policy is very simple : Block and clone .
On the one hand , he wants to satisfy people &apos;s need of a social network , which is very important ; people really love social networking .
But on the other hand , they want to keep the server in Beijing so they can access the data any time they want .
That &apos;s also the reason Google was pulled out from China , because they can &apos;t accept the fact that Chinese government wants to keep the server .
Sometimes the Arab dictators didn &apos;t understand these two hands .
For example , Mubarak , he shut down the Internet .
He wanted to prevent the Netizens &#91; from criticizing &#93; him .
But once Netizens can &apos;t go online , they go in the street .
And now the result is very simple .
We all know Mubarak is technically dead .
But also , Ben Ali , Tunisian president , didn &apos;t follow the second rule .
That means keep the server in your hands .
He allowed Facebook , a U.S.-based service , to continue to stay on inside of Tunisia .
So he can &apos;t prevent it , his own citizens to post critical videos against his corruption .
The same thing happend . He was the first to topple during the Arab Spring .
But those two very smart international censorship policies didn &apos;t prevent Chinese social media &#91; from &#93; becoming a really public sphere , a pathway of public opinion and the nightmare of Chinese officials .
Because we have 300 million microbloggers in China .
It &apos;s the entire population of the United States .
So when these 300 million people , microbloggers , even they block the tweet in our censored platform .
But itself -- the Chinanet -- but itself can create very powerful energy , which has never happened in the Chinese history .
2011 , in July , two &#91; unclear &#93; trains crashed , in Wenzhou , a southern city .
Right after the train crash , authorities literally wanted to cover up the train , bury the train .
So it angered the Chinese Netizens .
The first five days after the train crash , there were 10 million criticisms of the posting on social media , which never happened in Chinese history .
And later this year , the rail minister was sacked and sentenced to jail for 10 years .
And also , recently , very funny debate between the Beijing Environment Ministry and the American Embassy in Beijing because the Ministry blamed the American Embassy for intervening in Chinese internal politics by disclosing the air quality data of Beijing .
So , the up is the Embassy data , the PM 2.5 .
He showed 148 , they showed it &apos;s dangerous for the sensitive group .
So a suggestion , it &apos;s not good to go outside .
But that is the Ministry &apos;s data . He shows 50 .
He says it &apos;s good . It &apos;s good to go outside .
But 99 percent of Chinese microbloggers stand firmly on the Embassy &apos;s side .
I live in Beijing . Every day , I just watch the American Embassy &apos;s data to decide whether I should open my window .
Why is Chinese social networking , even within the censorship , so booming ? Part of the reason is Chinese languages .
You know , Twitter and Twitter clones have a kind of a limitation of 140 characters .
But in English it &apos;s 20 words or a sentence with a short link .
Maybe in Germany , in German language , it may be just &quot; Aha ! &quot;
But in Chinese language , it &apos;s really about 140 characters , means a paragraph , a story .
You can almost have all the journalistic elements there .
For example , this is Hamlet , of Shakespeare .
It &apos;s the same content . One , you can see exactly one Chinese tweet is equal to 3.5 English tweets .
Chinese is always cheating , right ?
So because of this , the Chinese really regard this microblogging as a media , not only a headline to media .
And also , the clone , Sina company is the guy who cloned Twitter .
It even has its own name , with Weibo .
&quot; Weibo &quot; is the Chinese translation for &quot; microblog &quot; .
It has its own innovation .
At the commenting area , &#91; it makes &#93; the Chinese Weibo more like Facebook , rather than the original Twitter .
So these innovations and clones , as the Weibo and microblogging , when it came to China in 2009 , it immediately became a media platform itself .
It became the media platform of 300 million readers .
It became the media .
Anything not mentioned in Weibo , it does not appear to exist for the Chinese public .
But also , Chinese social media is really changing Chinese mindsets and Chinese life .
For example , they give the voiceless people a channel to make your voice heard .
We had a petition system . It &apos;s a remedy outside the judicial system , because the Chinese central government wants to keep a myth : The emperor is good . The old local officials are thugs .
So that &apos;s why the petitioner , the victims , the peasants , want to take the train to Beijing to petition to the central government , they want the emperor to settle the problem .
But when more and more people go to Beijing , they also cause the risk of a revolution .
So they send them back in recent years .
And even some of them were put into black jails .
But now we have Weibo , so I call it the Weibo petition .
People just use their cell phones to tweet .
So your sad stories , by some chance your story will be picked up by reporters , professors or celebrities .
One of them is Yao Chen , she is the most popular microblogger in China , who has about 21 million followers .
They &apos;re almost like a national TV station .
If you -- so a sad story will be picked up by her .
So this Weibo social media , even in the censorship , still gave the Chinese a real chance for 300 million people every day chatting together , talking together .
It &apos;s like a big TED , right ?
But also , it is like the first time a public sphere happened in China .
Chinese people start to learn how to negotiate and talk to people .
But also , the cat , the censorship , is not sleeping .
It &apos;s so hard to post some sensitive words on the Chinese Weibo .
For example , you can &apos;t post the name of the president , Hu Jintao , and also you can &apos;t post the city of Chongqing , the name , and until recently , you can &apos;t search the surname of top leaders .
So , the Chinese are very good at these puns and alternative wording and even memes .
They even name themselves -- you know , use the name of this world-changing battle between the grass-mud horse and the river crab .
The grass-mud horse is caoníma , is the phonogram for motherfucker , the Netizens call themselves .
River crab is héxiè , is the phonogram for harmonization , for censorship .
So that &apos;s kind of a caoníma versus the héxiè , that &apos;s very good .
So , when some very political , exciting moments happened , you can see on Weibo , you see a lot of very weird stories happened .
Weird phrases and words , even if you have a PhD of Chinese language , you can &apos;t understand them .
But you can &apos;t even expand more , no , because Chinese Sina Weibo , when it was founded was exactly one month after the official blocking of Twitter.com.
That means from the very beginning , Weibo has already convinced the Chinese government , we will not become the stage for any kind of a threat to the regime .
For example , anything you want to post , like &quot; get together &quot; or &quot; meet up &quot; or &quot; walk , &quot; it is automatically recorded and data mined and reported to a poll for further political analyzing .
Even if you want to have some gathering , before you go there , the police are already waiting for you .
Why ? Because they have the data .
They have everything in their hands .
So they can use the 1984 scenario data mining of the dissident .
So the crackdown is very serious .
But I want you to notice a very funny thing during the process of the cat-and-mouse .
The cat is the censorship , but Chinese is not only one cat , but also has local cats . Central cat and local cats .
You know , the server is in the &#91; central &#93; cats &apos; hands , so even that -- when the Netizens criticize the local government , the local government has not any access to the data in Beijing .
Without bribing the central cats , he can do nothing , only apologize .
So these three years , in the past three years , social movements about microblogging really changed local government , became more and more transparent , because they can &apos;t access the data .
The server is in Beijing .
The story about the train crash , maybe the question is not about why 10 million criticisms in five days , but why the Chinese central government allowed the five days of freedom of speech online .
It &apos;s never happened before .
And so it &apos;s very simple , because even the top leaders were fed up with this guy , this independent kingdom .
So they want an excuse -- public opinion is a very good excuse to punish him .
But also , the Bo Xilai case recently , very big news , he &apos;s a princeling .
But from February to April this year , Weibo really became a marketplace of rumors .
You can almost joke everything about these princelings , everything ! It &apos;s almost like you &apos;re living in the United States .
But if you dare to retweet or mention any fake coup about Beijing , you definitely will be arrested .
So this kind of freedom is a targeted and precise window .
So Chinese in China , censorship is normal .
Something you find is , freedom is weird .
Something will happen behind it .
Because he was a very popular Leftist leader , so the central government wanted to purge him , and he was very cute , he convinced all the Chinese people , why he is so bad .
So Weibo , the 300 million public sphere , became a very good , convenient tool for a political fight .
But this technology is very new , but technically is very old .
It was made famous by Chairman Mao , Mao Zedong , because he mobilized millions of Chinese people in the Cultural Revolution to destroy every local government .
It &apos;s very simple , because Chinese central government doesn &apos;t need to even lead the public opinion .
They just give them a target window to not censor people .
Not censoring in China has become a political tool .
So that &apos;s the update about this game , cat-and-mouse .
Social media changed Chinese mindset .
More and more Chinese intend to embrace freedom of speech and human rights as their birthright , not some imported American privilege .
But also , it gave the Chinese a national public sphere for people to , it &apos;s like a training of their citizenship , preparing for future democracy .
But it didn &apos;t change the Chinese political system , and also the Chinese central government utilized this centralized server structure to strengthen its power to counter the local government and the different factions .
So , what &apos;s the future ?
After all , we are the mouse .
Whatever the future is , we should fight against the &#91; cat &#93; .
There is not only in China , but also in the United States there are some very small , cute but bad cats .
SOPA , PIPA , ACTA , TPP and ITU .
And also , like Facebook and Google , they claim they are friends of the mouse , but sometimes we see them dating the cats .
So my conclusion is very simple .
We Chinese fight for our freedom , you just watch your bad cats .
Don &apos;t let them hook &#91; up &#93; with the Chinese cats .
Only in this way , in the future , we will achieve the dreams of the mouse : that we can tweet anytime , anywhere , without fear .
Thank you .

&lt; description &gt; Michael Anti has been blogging from China for 12 years . Despite the control the central government has over the Internet -- &quot; All the servers are in Beijing &quot; -- he says that hundreds of millions of microbloggers are in fact creating the first national public sphere in the country &apos;s history , and shifting the balance of power in unexpected ways . &lt; / description &gt;

&lt; url &gt; http : / / www.ted.com / talks / ramesh _ raskar _ a _ camera _ that _ takes _ one _ trillion _ frames _ per _ second.html &lt; / url &gt;
Doc Edgerton inspired us with awe and curiosity with this photo of a bullet piercing through an apple , and exposure just a millionth of a second .
But now , 50 years later , we can go a million times faster and see the world not at a million , or a billion , but one trillion frames per second .
I present you a new type of photography , femto-photography , a new imaging technique so fast that it can create slow motion videos of light in motion .
And with that , we can create cameras that can look around corners , beyond line of sight or see inside our body without an X-ray , and really challenge what we mean by a camera .
Now if I take a laser pointer and turn it on and off in one trillionth of a second -- which is several femtoseconds -- I &apos;ll create a packet of photons barely a millimeter wide , and that packet of photons , that bullet , will travel at the speed of light , and , again , a million times faster than an ordinary bullet .
Now , if you take that bullet and take this packet of photons and fire into this bottle , how will those photons shatter into this bottle ?
How does light look in slow motion ?
Now , the whole event -- Now , remember , the whole event is effectively taking place in less than a nanosecond — that &apos;s how much time it takes for light to travel — but I &apos;m slowing down in this video by a factor of 10 billion so you can see the light in motion .
But , Coca-Cola did not sponsor this research .
Now , there &apos;s a lot going on in this movie , so let me break this down and show you what &apos;s going on .
So , the pulse enters the bottle , our bullet , with a packet of photons that start traveling through and that start scattering inside .
Some of the light leaks , goes on the table , and you start seeing these ripples of waves .
Many of the photons eventually reach the cap and then they explode in various directions .
As you can see , there &apos;s a bubble of air , and it &apos;s bouncing around inside .
Meanwhile , the ripples are traveling on the table , and because of the reflections at the top , you see at the back of the bottle , after several frames , the reflections are focused .
Now , if you take an ordinary bullet and let it go the same distance and slow down the video again by a factor of 10 billion , do you know how long you &apos;ll have to sit here to watch that movie ?
A day , a week ? Actually , a whole year .
It &apos;ll be a very boring movie — — of a slow , ordinary bullet in motion .
And what about some still-life photography ?
You can watch the ripples again washing over the table , the tomato and the wall in the back .
It &apos;s like throwing a stone in a pond of water .
I thought , this is how nature paints a photo , one femto frame at a time , but of course our eye sees an integral composite .
But if you look at this tomato one more time , you will notice , as the light washes over the tomato , it continues to glow . It doesn &apos;t become dark .
Why is that ? Because the tomato is actually ripe , and the light is bouncing around inside the tomato , and it comes out after several trillionths of a second .
So , in the future , when this femto-camera is in your camera phone , you might be able to go to a supermarket and check if the fruit is ripe without actually touching it .
So how did my team at MIT create this camera ?
Now , as photographers , you know , if you take a short exposure photo , you get very little light , but we &apos;re going to go a billion times faster than your shortest exposure , so you &apos;re going to get hardly any light .
So , what we do is we send that bullet , those packet of photons , millions of times , and record again and again with very clever synchronization , and from the gigabytes of data , we computationally weave together to create those femto-videos I showed you .
And we can take all that raw data and treat it in very interesting ways .
So , Superman can fly .
Some other heroes can become invisible , but what about a new power for a future superhero : to see around corners ?
The idea is that we could shine some light on the door .
It &apos;s going to bounce , go inside the room , some of that is going to reflect back on the door , and then back to the camera , and we could exploit these multiple bounces of light .
And it &apos;s not science fiction . We have actually built it .
On the left , you see our femto-camera .
There &apos;s a mannequin hidden behind a wall , and we &apos;re going to bounce light off the door .
So after our paper was published in Nature Communications , it was highlighted by Nature.com , and they created this animation .
We &apos;re going to fire those bullets of light , and they &apos;re going to hit this wall , and because the packet of the photons , they will scatter in all the directions , and some of them will reach our hidden mannequin , which in turn will again scatter that light , and again in turn the door will reflect some of that scattered light , and a tiny fraction of the photons will actually come back to the camera , but most interestingly , they will all arrive at a slightly different time slot .
And because we have a camera that can run so fast , our femto-camera , it has some unique abilities .
It has very good time resolution , and it can look at the world at the speed of light .
And this way , we know the distances , of course to the door , but also to the hidden objects , but we don &apos;t know which point corresponds to which distance .
By shining one laser , we can record one raw photo , which , you look on the screen , doesn &apos;t really make any sense , but then we will take a lot of such pictures , dozens of such pictures , put them together , and try to analyze the multiple bounces of light , and from that , can we see the hidden object ?
Can we see it in full 3D ?
So this is our reconstruction .
Now we have some ways to go before we take this outside the lab on the road , but in the future , we could create cars that avoid collisions with what &apos;s around the bend , or we can look for survivors in hazardous conditions by looking at light reflected through open windows , or we can build endoscopes that can see deep inside the body around occluders , and also for cardioscopes .
But of course , because of tissue and blood , this is quite challenging , so this is really a call for scientists to start thinking about femto-photography as really a new imaging modality to solve the next generation of health imaging problems .
Now , like Doc Edgerton , a scientist himself , science became art , an art of ultra-fast photography , and I realized that all the gigabytes of data that we &apos;re collecting every time is not just for scientific imaging , but we can also do a new form of computational photography with time-lapse and color-coding , and we look at those ripples . Remember , the time between each of those ripples is only a few trillionths of a second .
But there &apos;s also something funny going on here .
When you look at the ripples under the cap , the ripples are moving away from us .
The ripples should be moving towards us .
What &apos;s going on here ?
It turns out , because we &apos;re recording nearly at the speed of light , we have strange effects , and Einstein would have loved to see this picture .
The order at which events take place in the world appear in the camera with sometimes reversed order , so by applying the corresponding space and time warp , we can correct for this distortion .
So whether it &apos;s for photography around corners , or creating the next generation of health imaging , or creating new visualizations , since our invention , we have open-sourced all the data and details on our website , and our hope is that the DIY , the creative and the research community will show us that we should stop obsessing about the megapixels in cameras — — and start focusing on the next dimension in imaging .
It &apos;s about time . Thank you .

&lt; url &gt; http : / / www.ted.com / talks / lewis _ pugh _ s _ mind _ shifting _ mt _ everest _ swim.html &lt; / url &gt;
Last year when I was here , I was speaking to you about a swim which I did across the North Pole .
And while that swim took place three years ago , I can remember it as if it was yesterday .
I remember standing on the edge of the ice , about to dive into the water , and thinking to myself , I have never ever seen any place on this earth which is just so frightening .
The water is completely black .
The water is minus 1.7 degrees centigrade , or 29 degrees Fahrenheit .
It &apos;s flipping freezing in that water .
And then a thought came across my mind : if things go pear-shaped on this swim , how long will it take for my frozen body to sink the four and a half kilometers to the bottom of the ocean ?
And then I said to myself , I &apos;ve just got to get this thought out of my mind as quickly as possible .
And the only way I can dive into that freezing cold water and swim a kilometer is by listening to my iPod and really revving myself up , listening to everything from beautiful opera all the way across to Puff Daddy , and then committing myself a hundred percent -- there is nothing more powerful than the made-up mind -- and then walking up to the edge of the ice and just diving into the water .
And that swim took me 18 minutes and 50 seconds , and it felt like 18 days .
And I remember getting out of the water and my hands feeling so painful and looking down at my fingers , and my fingers were literally the size of sausages because -- you know , we &apos;re made partially of water -- when water freezes it expands , and so the cells in my fingers had frozen and expanded and burst .
And the most immediate thought when I came out of that water was the following : I &apos;m never , ever going to do another cold water swim in my life again .
Anyway , last year , I heard about the Himalayas and the melting of the -- and the melting of the glaciers because of climate change .
I heard about this lake , Lake Imja .
This lake has been formed in the last couple of years because of the melting of the glacier .
The glacier &apos;s gone all the way up the mountain and left in its place this big lake .
And I firmly believe that what we &apos;re seeing in the Himalayas is the next great , big battleground on this earth .
Nearly two billion people -- so one in three people on this earth -- rely on the water from the Himalayas .
And with a population increasing as quickly as it is , and with the water supply from these glaciers -- because of climate change -- decreasing so much , I think we have a real risk of instability .
North , you &apos;ve got China ; south , you &apos;ve India , Pakistan , Bangladesh , all these countries .
And so I decided to walk up to Mt . Everest , the highest mountain on this earth , and go and do a symbolic swim underneath the summit of Mt . Everest .
Now , I don &apos;t know if any of you have had the opportunity to go to Mt . Everest , but it &apos;s quite an ordeal getting up there .
28 great , big , powerful yaks carrying all the equipment up onto this mountain -- I don &apos;t just have my Speedo , but there &apos;s a big film crew who then send all the images around the world .
The other thing which was so challenging about this swim is not just the altitude .
I wanted to do the swim at 5,300 meters above sea level .
So it &apos;s right up in the heavens .
It &apos;s very , very difficult to breath . You get altitude sickness .
I feels like you &apos;ve got a man standing behind you with a hammer just hitting your head all the time .
That &apos;s not the worst part of it .
The worst part was this year was the year where they decided to do a big cleanup operation on Mt . Everest .
Many , many people have died on Mt . Everest , and this was the year they decided to go and recover all the bodies of the mountaineers and then bring them down the mountain .
And when you &apos;re walking up the mountain to attempt to do something which no human has ever done before , and , in fact , no fish -- there are no fish up there swimming at 5,300 meters -- When you &apos;re trying to do that , and then the bodies are coming past you , it humbles you , and you also realize very , very clearly that nature is so much more powerful than we are .
And we walked up this pathway , all the way up .
And to the right hand side of us was this great Khumbu Glacier .
And all the way along the glacier we saw these big pools of melting ice .
And then we got up to this small lake underneath the summit of Mt . Everest , and I prepared myself the same way as I &apos;ve always prepared myself , for this swim which was going to be so very difficult .
I put on my iPod , I listened to some music , I got myself as aggressive as possible -- but controlled aggression -- and then I hurled myself into that water .
I swam as quickly as I could for the first hundred meters , and then I realized very , very quickly , I had a huge problem on my hands .
I could barely breathe .
I was gasping for air .
I then began to choke , and then it quickly led to me vomiting in the water .
And it all happened so quickly : I then -- I don &apos;t know how it happened -- but I went underwater .
And luckily , the water was quite shallow , and I was able to push myself off the bottom of the lake and get up and then take another gasp of air .
And then I said , carry on . Carry on . Carry on .
I carried on for another five or six strokes , and then I had nothing in my body , and I went down to the bottom of the lake .
And I don &apos;t where I got it from , but I was able to somehow pull myself up and as quickly as possible get to the side of the lake .
I &apos;ve heard it said that drowning is the most peaceful death that you can have .
I have never , ever heard such utter bollocks .
It is the most frightening and panicky feeling that you can have .
I got myself to the side of the lake .
My crew grabbed me , and then we walked as quickly as we could down -- over the rubble -- down to our camp .
And there , we sat down , and we did a debrief about what had gone wrong there on Mt . Everest .
And my team just gave it to me straight .
They said , Lewis , you need to have a radical tactical shift if you want to do this swim .
Every single thing which you have learned in the past 23 years of swimming , you must forget .
Every single thing which you learned when you were serving in the British army , about speed and aggression , you put that to one side .
We want you to walk up the hill in another two days &apos; time .
Take some time to rest and think about things .
We want you to walk up the mountain in two days &apos; time , and instead of swimming fast , swim as slowly as possible .
Instead of swimming crawl , swim breaststroke .
And remember , never ever swim with aggression .
This is the time to swim with real humility .
And so we walked back up to the mountain two days later .
And I stood there on the edge of the lake , and I looked up at Mt . Everest -- and she is one of the most beautiful mountains on the earth -- and I said to myself , just do this slowly .
And I swam across the lake .
And I can &apos;t begin to tell you how good I felt when I came to the other side .
But I learned two very , very important lessons there on Mt . Everest , and I thank my team of Sherpas who taught me this .
The first one is that just because something has worked in the past so well , doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s going to work in the future .
And similarly , now , before I do anything , I ask myself what type of mindset do I require to successfully complete a task .
And taking that into the world of climate change -- which is , frankly , the Mt . Everest of all problems -- just because we &apos;ve lived the way we have lived for so long , just because we have consumed the way we have for so long and populated the earth the way we have for so long , doesn &apos;t mean that we can carry on the way we are carrying on .
The warning signs are all there .
When I was born , the world &apos;s population was 3.5 billion people .
We &apos;re now 6.8 billion people , and we &apos;re expected to be 9 billion people by 2050 .
And then the second lesson , the radical , tactical shift .
And I &apos;ve come here to ask you today : what radical tactical shift can you take in your relationship to the environment , which will ensure that our children and our grandchildren live in a safe world and a secure world , and most importantly , in a sustainable world ?
And I ask you , please , to go away from here and think about that one radical tactical shift which you could make , which will make that big difference , and then commit a hundred percent to doing it .
Blog about it , tweet about it , talk about it , and commit a hundred percent , because very , very few things are impossible to achieve if we really put our whole minds to it .
So thank you very , very much .

So the type of magic I like , and I &apos;m a magician , is a magic that uses technology to create illusions .
So I would like to show you something I &apos;ve been working on .
It &apos;s an application that I think will be useful for artists -- multimedia artists in particular .
It synchronizes videos across multiple screens of mobile devices .
And I borrowed these three iPods from people here in the audience to show you what I mean .
And I &apos;m going to use them to tell you a little bit about my favorite subject : deception .
One of my favorite magicians is Karl Germain .
He had this wonderful trick where a rosebush would bloom right in front of your eyes .
But it was his production of a butterfly that was the most beautiful .
Ladies and gentlemen , the creation of life .
Marco Tempest : When asked about deception , he said this : Magic is the only honest profession .
A magician promises to deceive you -- and he does .
MT : I like to think of myself as an honest magician .
I use a lot of tricks , which means that sometimes I have to lie to you .
Now I feel bad about that .
But people lie every day .
Hold on .
Girl in Phone : Hey , where are you ?
MT : Stuck in traffic . I &apos;ll be there soon .
You &apos;ve all done it .
Lady : I &apos;ll be ready in just a minute , darling .
It &apos;s just what I &apos;ve always wanted .
You were great .
MT : Deception , it &apos;s a fundamental part of life .
Now polls show that men tell twice as many lies as women -- assuming the women they ask told the truth .
We deceive to gain advantage and to hide our weaknesses .
The Chinese general Sun Tzu said that all war was based on deception .
Oscar Wilde said the same thing of romance .
Some people deceive for money .
Let &apos;s play a game .
Three cards , three chances .
One five will get you 10 , 10 will get you 20 .
Now where &apos;s the lady ?
Where is the queen ?
MT : This one ?
Sorry . You lose .
Well , I didn &apos;t deceive you .
You deceived yourself .
Self-deception .
That &apos;s when we convince ourselves that a lie is the truth .
Sometimes it &apos;s hard to tell the two apart .
Compulsive gamblers are experts at self-deception .
They believe they can win .
They forget the times they lose .
The brain is very good at forgetting .
Bad experiences are quickly forgotten .
Bad experiences quickly disappear .
Which is why in this vast and lonely cosmos , we are so wonderfully optimistic .
Our self-deception becomes a positive illusion -- why movies are able to take us onto extraordinary adventures ; why we believe Romeo when he says he loves Juliet ; and why single notes of music , when played together , become a sonata and conjure up meaning .
That &apos;s &quot; Clair de Lune . &quot;
Its composer called Debussy said that art was the greatest deception of all .
Art is a deception that creates real emotions -- a lie that creates a truth .
And when you give yourself over to that deception , it becomes magic .
Thank you . Thank you very much .

&lt; url &gt; http : / / www.ted.com / talks / tyler _ dewitt _ hey _ science _ teachers _ make _ it _ fun.html &lt; / url &gt;
Let me tell you a story .
It &apos;s my first year as a new high school science teacher , and I &apos;m so eager .
I &apos;m so excited , I &apos;m pouring myself into my lesson plans .
But I &apos;m slowly coming to this horrifying realization that my students just might not be learning anything .
This happens one day : I &apos;d just assigned my class to read this textbook chapter about my favorite subject in all of biology : viruses and how they attack .
And so I &apos;m so excited to discuss this with them , and I come in and I say , &quot; Can somebody please explain the main ideas and why this is so cool ? &quot;
There &apos;s silence .
Finally , my favorite student , she looks me straight in the eye , and she says , &quot; The reading sucked . &quot;
And then she clarified . She said , &quot; You know what , I don &apos;t mean that it sucks . It means that I didn &apos;t understand a word of it .
It &apos;s boring . Um , who cares , and it sucks . &quot;
These sympathetic smiles spread all throughout the room now , and I realize that all of my other students are in the same boat , that maybe they took notes or they memorized definitions from the textbook , but not one of them really understood the main ideas .
Not one of them can tell me why this stuff is so cool , why it &apos;s so important .
I &apos;m totally clueless .
I have no idea what to do next .
So the only thing I can think of is say , &quot; Listen . Let me tell you a story .
The main characters in the story are bacteria and viruses .
These guys are blown up a couple million times .
The real bacteria and viruses are so small we can &apos;t see them without a microscope , and you guys might know bacteria and viruses because they both make us sick .
But what a lot of people don &apos;t know is that viruses can also make bacteria sick . &quot;
Now , the story that I start telling my kids , it starts out like a horror story .
Once upon a time there &apos;s this happy little bacterium .
Don &apos;t get too attached to him .
Maybe he &apos;s floating around in your stomach or in some spoiled food somewhere , and all of a sudden he starts to not feel so good .
Maybe he ate something bad for lunch , and then things get really horrible , as his skin rips apart , and he sees a virus coming out from his insides .
And then it gets horrible when he bursts open and an army of viruses floods out from his insides .
If -- Ouch is right ! -- If you see this , and you &apos;re a bacterium , this is like your worst nightmare .
But if you &apos;re a virus and you see this , you cross those little legs of yours and you think , &quot; We rock . &quot;
Because it took a lot of crafty work to infect this bacterium .
Here &apos;s what had to happen .
A virus grabbed onto a bacterium and it slipped its DNA into it .
The next thing is , that virus DNA made stuff that chopped up the bacteria DNA .
And now that we &apos;ve gotten rid of the bacteria DNA , the virus DNA takes control of the cell and it tells it to start making more viruses .
Because , you see , DNA is like a blueprint that tells living things what to make .
So this is kind of like going into a car factory and replacing the blueprints with blueprints for killer robots .
The workers still come the next day , they do their job , but they &apos;re following different instructions .
So replacing the bacteria DNA with virus DNA turns the bacteria into a factory for making viruses -- that is , until it &apos;s so filled with viruses that it bursts .
But that &apos;s not the only way that viruses infect bacteria .
Some are much more crafty .
When a secret agent virus infects a bacterium , they do a little espionage .
Here , this cloaked , secret agent virus is slipping his DNA into the bacterial cell , but here &apos;s the kicker : It doesn &apos;t do anything harmful -- not at first .
Instead , it silently slips into the bacteria &apos;s own DNA , and it just stays there like a terrorist sleeper cell , waiting for instructions .
And what &apos;s interesting about this is now whenever this bacteria has babies , the babies also have the virus DNA in them .
So now we have a whole extended bacteria family , filled with virus sleeper cells .
They &apos;re just happily living together until a signal happens and -- BAM ! -- all of the DNA pops out .
It takes control of these cells , turns them into virus-making factories , and they all burst , a huge , extended bacteria family , all dying with viruses spilling out of their guts , the viruses taking over the bacterium .
So now you understand how viruses can attack cells .
There are two ways : On the left is what we call the lytic way , where the viruses go right in and take over the cells .
On the &#91; right &#93; is the lysogenic way that uses secret agent viruses .
So this stuff is not that hard , right ?
And now all of you understand it .
But if you &apos;ve graduated from high school , I can almost guarantee you &apos;ve seen this information before .
But I bet it was presented in a way that it didn &apos;t exactly stick in your mind .
So when my students were first learning this , why did they hate it so much ?
Well , there were a couple of reasons .
First of all , I can guarantee you that their textbooks didn &apos;t have secret agent viruses , and they didn &apos;t have horror stories .
You know , in the communication of science there is this obsession with seriousness .
It kills me . I &apos;m not kidding .
I used to work for an educational publisher , and as a writer , I was always told never to use stories or fun , engaging language , because then my work might not be viewed as &quot; serious &quot; and &quot; scientific . &quot;
Right ? I mean , because God forbid somebody have fun when they &apos;re learning science .
So we have this field of science that &apos;s all about slime , and color changes . Check this out .
And then we have , of course , as any good scientist has to have , explosions !
But if a textbook seems too much fun , it &apos;s somehow unscientific .
Now another problem was that the language in their textbook was truly incomprehensible .
If we want to summarize that story that I told you earlier , we could start by saying something like , &quot; These viruses make copies of themselves by slipping their DNA into a bacterium . &quot;
The way this showed up in the textbook , it looked like this : &quot; Bacteriophage replication is initiated through the introduction of viral nucleic acid into a bacterium . &quot;
That &apos;s great , perfect for 13-year-olds .
But here &apos;s the thing . There are plenty of people in science education who would look at this and say there &apos;s no way that we could ever give that to students , because it contains some language that isn &apos;t completely accurate .
For example , I told you that viruses have DNA .
Well , a very tiny fraction of them don &apos;t .
They have something called RNA instead .
So a professional science writer would circle that and say , &quot; That has to go .
We have to change it to something much more technical . &quot;
And after a team of professional science editors went over this really simple explanation , they &apos;d find fault with almost every word I &apos;ve used , and they &apos;d have to change anything that wasn &apos;t serious enough , and they &apos;d have to change everything that wasn &apos;t 100 percent perfect .
Then it would be accurate , but it would be completely impossible to understand .
This is horrifying .
You know , I keep talking about this idea of telling a story , and it &apos;s like science communication has taken on this idea of what I call the tyranny of precision , where you can &apos;t just tell a story .
It &apos;s like science has become that horrible storyteller that we all know , who gives us all the details nobody cares about , where you &apos;re like , &quot; Oh , I met my friend for lunch the other day , and she was wearing these ugly jeans .
I mean , they weren &apos;t really jeans , they were more kind of , like , leggings , but , like , I guess they &apos;re actually kind of more like jeggings , like , but I think — &quot; and you &apos;re just like , &quot; Oh my God .
What is the point ? &quot;
Or even worse , science education is becoming like that guy who always says , &quot; Actually . &quot;
Right ? You want to be like , &quot; Oh , dude , we had to get up in the middle of the night and drive a hundred miles in total darkness . &quot;
And that guy &apos;s like , &quot; Actually , it was 87.3 miles . &quot;
And you &apos;re like , &quot; Actually , shut up !
I &apos;m just trying to tell a story . &quot;
Because good storytelling is all about emotional connection .
We have to convince our audience that what we &apos;re talking about matters .
But just as important is knowing which details we should leave out so that the main point still comes across .
I &apos;m reminded of what the architect Mies van der Rohe said , and I paraphrase , when he said that sometimes you have to lie in order to tell the truth .
I think this sentiment is particularly relevant to science education .
Now , finally , I am often so disappointed when people think that I &apos;m advocating a dumbing down of science .
That &apos;s not true at all .
I &apos;m currently a Ph.D. student at MIT , and I absolutely understand the importance of detailed , specific scientific communication between experts , but not when we &apos;re trying to teach 13-year-olds .
If a young learner thinks that all viruses have DNA , that &apos;s not going to ruin their chances of success in science .
But if a young learner can &apos;t understand anything in science and learns to hate it because it all sounds like this , that will ruin their chances of success .
This needs to stop , and I wish that the change could come from the institutions at the top that are perpetuating these problems , and I beg them , I beseech them to just stop it .
But I think that &apos;s unlikely .
So we are so lucky that we have resources like the Internet , where we can circumvent these institutions from the bottom up .
There &apos;s a growing number of online resources that are dedicated to just explaining science in simple , understandable ways .
I dream of a Wikipedia-like website that would explain any scientific concept you can think of in simple language any middle schooler can understand .
And I myself spend most of my free time making these science videos that I put on YouTube .
I explain chemical equilibrium using analogies to awkward middle school dances , and I talk about fuel cells with stories about boys and girls at a summer camp .
The feedback that I get is sometimes misspelled and it &apos;s often written in LOLcats , but nonetheless it &apos;s so appreciative , so thankful that I know this is the right way we should be communicating science .
There &apos;s still so much work left to be done , though , and if you &apos;re involved with science in any way I urge you to join me .
Pick up a camera , start to write a blog , whatever , but leave out the seriousness , leave out the jargon .
Make me laugh . Make me care .
Leave out those annoying details that nobody cares about and just get to the point .
How should you start ?
Why don &apos;t you say , &quot; Listen , let me tell you a story &quot; ?
Thank you .

&lt; description &gt; High school science teacher Tyler DeWitt was ecstatic about a lesson plan on bacteria -- and devastated when his students hated it .

He delivers a rousing call for science teachers to ditch the jargon and extreme precision , and instead make science sing through stories and demonstrations . &lt; / description &gt;

&lt; url &gt; http : / / www.ted.com / talks / matthew _ childs _ 9 _ rules _ of _ rock _ climbing.html &lt; / url &gt;
It &apos;s pretty simple . There are nine , sort of , rules that I discovered after 35 years of rock climbing .
Most of them are pretty basic .
Number one : don &apos;t let go -- very sure success method .
But really , truly -- often you think about letting go way before your body does .
So hang in there , and you come up with some pretty peculiar solutions .
Number two : hesitation is bad .
This is a friction climb , up in Tuolumne Meadows , in the Yosemite high country .
Friction climbing doesn &apos;t have any sort of hard positive edges .
You &apos;re climbing on little dimples and nubbins in the rock .
The most friction you have is when you first put your hand or your foot on the rock .
And then from that point on , you &apos;re basically falling .
So momentum is good . Don &apos;t stop .
Rule number three : have a plan .
This is a climb called the Naked Edge , in El Dorado Canyon , outside of Boulder .
This climber is on the last pitch of it .
He &apos;s actually right about where I fell .
There is about 1,000 feet of air below him .
And all the hard pitches are actually below him .
Often what happens is you &apos;re planning so hard for like , &quot; How do I get through the hardest part ? How do I get through the hardest part ? &quot;
And then what happens ?
You get to the last pitch . It &apos;s easy .
And you &apos;re completely flamed out . Don &apos;t do it .
But you also can &apos;t forget that each individual move you have to be able to complete .
This is a climb called the Dike Route , on Pywjack Dome , up in the Yosemite high country .
The interesting thing about this climb is it &apos;s not that hard .
But if you &apos;re the leader on it , at the hardest move , you &apos;re looking at about 100 foot fall , onto some low angle slabs .
So you &apos;ve got to focus .
You don &apos;t want to stop in the middle like Coleridge &apos;s Kubla Kahn .
You &apos;ve got to keep going .
Rule number five : know how to rest .
It &apos;s amazing . The best climbers are the ones that in the most extreme situations can get their bodies into some position where they can rest , regroup , calm themselves , focus , and keep going .
This is a climb in the Needles , again in California .
Fear really sucks because what it means is you &apos;re not focusing on what you &apos;re doing .
You &apos;re focusing on the consequences of failing at what you &apos;re doing because any given move should require all your concentration and thought processes to execute it effectively .
One of the things in climbing is , most people sort of take it straight on . And they follow the most obvious solution .
This is the Devils Tower in Wyoming , which is a columnar basalt formation that most of you probably know from &quot; Close Encounters . &quot;
With this , typically crack climbers would put their hands in and their toes in and just start climbing .
The cracks are too small to get your toes into so the only way to climb is using your fingertips in the cracks , and using opposing pressure and forcing yourself up .
Rule number eight : strength doesn &apos;t always equal success .
In the 35 years I &apos;ve been a climbing guide and taught on indoor walls , and stuff like that , the most important thing I &apos;ve learned was , guys will always try to do pull-ups .
Beginning guys , it &apos;s like , they thrash , they thrash , they get 15 feet up -- and they can do about 15 pull-ups right -- And then they just flame out .
Women are much more in balance because they don &apos;t have that idea that they &apos;re going to be able to do 100 pull-ups .
They think about how to get the weight over their feet because it &apos;s sort of natural -- they carry you all day long .
So balance is really critical , and keeping your weight on your feet , which is your strongest muscle .
And of course there is rule number nine .
I came up with rule number nine after I actually didn &apos;t plan for a fall , and went about 40 feet and cracked a rib .
Once you get to that point where you know it &apos;s going to happen , you need to start thinking about how you &apos;re going to let go because that is the critical piece of not getting hurt -- how you &apos;re going to fall onto the rope , or if you &apos;re climbing without a rope , fall to a place where you can actually control the fall .
So don &apos;t hang on till the bitter end .
Thank you very much .

So does that .
This means &quot; mouse . &quot;

Here we have a story .
The start of the story , where this means guy , and that is a ponytail on a passer-by .
Here &apos;s where it happens .
These are when .
This is a cassette tape the girl puts into her cassette-tape player .
She wears it every day .
It &apos;s not considered vintage -- she just likes certain music to sound a certain way .
Look at her posture ; it &apos;s remarkable .
That &apos;s because she dances .
Now he , the guy , takes all of this in , figuring , &quot; Honestly , geez , what are my chances ? &quot;
And he could say , &quot; Oh my God ! &quot;
or &quot; I heart you ! &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m laughing out loud . &quot;
&quot; I want to give you a hug . &quot;
But he comes up with that , you know .
He tells her , &quot; I &apos;d like to hand-paint your portrait on a coffee mug . &quot;
Put a crab inside it .
Add some water .
Seven different salts .
He means he &apos;s got this sudden notion to stand on dry land , but just panhandle at the ocean .
He says , &quot; You look like a mermaid , but you walk like a waltz . &quot;
And the girl goes , &quot; Wha &apos; ? &quot;
So , the guy replies , &quot; Yeah , I know , I know .
I think my heartbeat might be the Morse code for inappropriate .
At least , that &apos;s how it seems .
I &apos;m like a junior varsity cheerleader sometimes -- for swearing , awkward silences , and very simple rhyme schemes .
Right now , talking to you , I &apos;m not even really a guy .
I &apos;m a monkey -- -- blowing kisses at a butterfly .
But I &apos;m still suggesting you and I should meet .
First , soon , and then a lot .
I &apos;m thinking the southwest corner of 5th and 42nd at noon tomorrow , but I &apos;ll stay until you show up , ponytail or not .
Hell , ponytail alone .
I don &apos;t know what else to tell you .
I got a pencil you can borrow .
You can put it in your phone . &quot;
But the girl does not budge , does not smile , does not frown .
She just says , &quot; No thank you . &quot;

&lt; url &gt; http : / / www.ted.com / talks / amy _ lockwood _ selling _ condoms _ in _ the _ congo.html &lt; / url &gt;
I am a reformed marketer , and I now work in international development .
In October , I spent some time in the Democratic Republic of Congo , which is the &#91; second &#93; largest country in Africa .
In fact , it &apos;s as large as Western Europe , but it only has 300 miles of paved roads .
The DRC is a dangerous place .
In the past 10 years , five million people have died due to a war in the east .
But war isn &apos;t the only reason that life is difficult in the DRC .
There are many health issues as well .
In fact , the HIV prevalence rate is 1.3 percent among adults .
This might not sound like a large number , but in a country with 76 million people , it means there are 930,000 that are infected .
And due to the poor infrastructure , only 25 percent of those are receiving the life-saving drugs that they need .
Which is why , in part , donor agencies provide condoms at low or no cost .
And so while I was in the DRC , I spent a lot of time talking to people about condoms , including Damien .
Damien runs a hotel outside of Kinshasa .
It &apos;s a hotel that &apos;s only open until midnight , so it &apos;s not a place that you stay .
But it is a place where sex workers and their clients come .
Now Damien knows all about condoms , but he doesn &apos;t sell them .
He said there &apos;s just not in demand .
It &apos;s not surprising , because only three percent of people in the DRC use condoms .
Joseph and Christine , who run a pharmacy where they sell a number of these condoms , said despite the fact that donor agencies provide them at low or no cost , and they have marketing campaigns that go along with them , their customers don &apos;t buy the branded versions .
They like the generics .
And as a marketer , I found that curious .
And so I started to look at what the marketing looked like .
And it turns out that there are three main messages used by the donor agencies for these condoms : fear , financing and fidelity .
They name the condoms things like Vive , &quot; to live &quot; or Trust .
They package it with the red ribbon that reminds us of HIV , put it in boxes that remind you who paid for them , show pictures of your wife or husband and tell you to protect them or to act prudently .
Now these are not the kinds of things that someone is thinking about just before they go get a condom .
What is it that you think about just before you get a condom ?
Sex !
And the private companies that sell condoms in these places , they understand this .
Their marketing is slightly different .
The name might not be much different , but the imagery sure is .
Some brands are aspirational , and certainly the packaging is incredibly provocative .
And this made me think that perhaps the donor agencies had just missed out on a key aspect of marketing : understanding who &apos;s the audience .
And for donor agencies , unfortunately , the audience tends to be people that aren &apos;t even in the country they &apos;re working &#91; in &#93; .
It &apos;s people back home , people that support their work , people like these .
But if what we &apos;re really trying to do is stop the spread of HIV , we need to think about the customer , the people whose behavior needs to change -- the couples , the young women , the young men -- whose lives depend on it .
And so the lesson is this : it doesn &apos;t really matter what you &apos;re selling ; you just have to think about who is your customer , and what are the messages that are going to get them to change their behavior .
It might just save their lives .
Thank you .

When I was president of the American Psychological Association , they tried to media-train me , and an encounter I had with CNN summarizes what I &apos;m going to be talking about today , which is the eleventh reason to be optimistic .
The editor of Discover told us 10 of them , I &apos;m going to give you the eleventh .
So they came to me -- CNN -- and they said , &quot; Professor Seligman , would you tell us about the state of psychology today ?
We &apos;d like to interview you about that . &quot; And I said , &quot; Great . &quot;
And she said , &quot; But this is CNN , so you only get a sound bite . &quot;
So I said , &quot; Well , how many words do I get ? &quot;
And she said , &quot; Well , one . &quot;
And cameras rolled , and she said , &quot; Professor Seligman , what is the state of psychology today ? &quot;
&quot; Good . &quot;
&quot; Cut . Cut . That won &apos;t do .
We &apos;d really better give you a longer sound bite . &quot;
&quot; Well , how many words do I get this time ? &quot; &quot; I think , well , you get two .
Doctor Seligman , what is the state of psychology today ? &quot;
&quot; Not good . &quot;
&quot; Look , Doctor Seligman , we can see you &apos;re really not comfortable in this medium .
We &apos;d better give you a real sound bite .
This time you can have three words .
Professor Seligman , what is the state of psychology today ? &quot;
&quot; Not good enough . &quot; And that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to be talking about .
I want to say why psychology was good , why it was not good and how it may become , in the next 10 years , good enough .
And by parallel summary , I want to say the same thing about technology , about entertainment and design , because I think the issues are very similar .
So , why was psychology good ?
Well , for more than 60 years , psychology worked within the disease model .
Ten years ago , when I was on an airplane and I introduced myself to my seatmate , and told them what I did , they &apos;d move away from me .
And because , quite rightly , they were saying psychology is about finding what &apos;s wrong with you . Spot the loony .
And now , when I tell people what I do , they move toward me .
And what was good about psychology , about the 30 billion dollar investment NIMH made , about working in the disease model , about what you mean by psychology , is that , 60 years ago , none of the disorders were treatable -- it was entirely smoke and mirrors .
And now , 14 of the disorders are treatable , two of them actually curable .
And the other thing that happened is that a science developed , a science of mental illness .
That we found out that we could take fuzzy concepts -- like depression , alcoholism -- and measure them with rigor .
That we could create a classification of the mental illnesses .
That we could understand the causality of the mental illnesses .
We could look across time at the same people -- people , for example , who were genetically vulnerable to schizophrenia -- and ask what the contribution of mothering , of genetics are , and we could isolate third variables by doing experiments on the mental illnesses .
And best of all , we were able , in the last 50 years , to invent drug treatments and psychological treatments .
And then we were able to test them rigorously , in random assignment , placebo controlled designs , throw out the things that didn &apos;t work , keep the things that actively did .
And the conclusion of that is that psychology and psychiatry , over the last 60 years , can actually claim that we can make miserable people less miserable .
And I think that &apos;s terrific . I &apos;m proud of it .
But what was not good , the consequences of that were three things .
The first was moral , that psychologists and psychiatrists became victimologists , pathologizers , that our view of human nature was that if you were in trouble , bricks fell on you .
And we forgot that people made choices and decisions .
We forgot responsibility . That was the first cost .
The second cost was that we forgot about you people .
We forgot about improving normal lives .
We forgot about a mission to make relatively untroubled people happier , more fulfilled , more productive . And &quot; genius , &quot; &quot; high-talent , &quot; became a dirty word .
No one works on that .
And the third problem about the disease model is , in our rush to do something about people in trouble , in our rush to do something about repairing damage , it never occurred to us to develop interventions to make people happier , positive interventions .
So that was not good .
And so , that &apos;s what led people like Nancy Etcoff , Dan Gilbert , Mike Csikszentmihalyi and myself to work in something I call positive psychology , which has three aims .
The first is that psychology should be just as concerned with human strength as it is with weakness .
It should be just as concerned with building strength as with repairing damage .
It should be interested in the best things in life .
And it should be just as concerned with making the lives of normal people fulfilling , and with genius , with nurturing high talent .
So in the last 10 years and the hope for the future , we &apos;ve seen the beginnings of a science of positive psychology , a science of what makes life worth living .
It turns out that we can measure different forms of happiness .
And any of you , for free , can go to that website and take the entire panoply of tests of happiness .
You can ask , how do you stack up for positive emotion , for meaning , for flow , against literally tens of thousands of other people ?
We created the opposite of the diagnostic manual of the insanities : a classification of the strengths and virtues that looks at the sex ratio , how they &apos;re defined , how to diagnose them , what builds them and what gets in their way .
We found that we could discover the causation of the positive states , the relationship between left hemispheric activity and right hemispheric activity as a cause of happiness .
I &apos;ve spent my life working on extremely miserable people , and I &apos;ve asked the question , how do extremely miserable people differ from the rest of you ?
And starting about six years ago , we asked about extremely happy people .
And how do they differ from the rest of us ?
And it turns out there &apos;s one way .
They &apos;re not more religious , they &apos;re not in better shape , they don &apos;t have more money , they &apos;re not better looking , they don &apos;t have more good events and fewer bad events .
The one way in which they differ : they &apos;re extremely social .
They don &apos;t sit in seminars on Saturday morning .
They don &apos;t spend time alone .
Each of them is in a romantic relationship and each has a rich repertoire of friends .
But watch out here . This is merely correlational data , not causal , and it &apos;s about happiness in the first Hollywood sense I &apos;m going to talk about : happiness of ebullience and giggling and good cheer .
And I &apos;m going to suggest to you that &apos;s not nearly enough , in just a moment .
We found we could begin to look at interventions over the centuries , from the Buddha to Tony Robbins .
About 120 interventions have been proposed that allegedly make people happy .
And we find that we &apos;ve been able to manualize many of them , and we actually carry out random assignment efficacy and effectiveness studies .
That is , which ones actually make people lastingly happier ?
In a couple of minutes , I &apos;ll tell you about some of those results .
But the upshot of this is that the mission I want psychology to have , in addition to its mission of curing the mentally ill , and in addition to its mission of making miserable people less miserable , is can psychology actually make people happier ?
And to ask that question -- happy is not a word I use very much -- we &apos;ve had to break it down into what I think is askable about happy .
And I believe there are three different -- and I call them different because different interventions build them , it &apos;s possible to have one rather than the other -- three different happy lives .
The first happy life is the pleasant life .
This is a life in which you have as much positive emotion as you possibly can , and the skills to amplify it .
The second is a life of engagement -- a life in your work , your parenting , your love , your leisure , time stops for you .
That &apos;s what Aristotle was talking about .
And third , the meaningful life .
So I want to say a little bit about each of those lives and what we know about them .
The first life is the pleasant life and it &apos;s simply , as best we can find it , it &apos;s having as many of the pleasures as you can , as much positive emotion as you can , and learning the skills -- savoring , mindfulness -- that amplify them , that stretch them over time and space .
But the pleasant life has three drawbacks , and it &apos;s why positive psychology is not happy-ology and why it doesn &apos;t end here .
The first drawback is that it turns out the pleasant life , your experience of positive emotion , is heritable , about 50 percent heritable , and , in fact , not very modifiable .
So the different tricks that Matthieu &#91; Ricard &#93; and I and others know about increasing the amount of positive emotion in your life are 15 to 20 percent tricks , getting more of it .
Second is that positive emotion habituates . It habituates rapidly , indeed .
It &apos;s all like French vanilla ice cream , the first taste is a 100 percent ; by the time you &apos;re down to the sixth taste , it &apos;s gone .
And , as I said , it &apos;s not particularly malleable .
And this leads to the second life .
And I have to tell you about my friend , Len , to talk about why positive psychology is more than positive emotion , more than building pleasure .
In two of the three great arenas of life , by the time Len was 30 , Len was enormously successful . The first arena was work .
By the time he was 20 , he was an options trader .
By the time he was 25 , he was a multimillionaire and the head of an options trading company .
Second , in play -- he &apos;s a national champion bridge player .
But in the third great arena of life , love , Len is an abysmal failure .
And the reason he was , was that Len is a cold fish .
Len is an introvert .
American women said to Len , when he dated them , &quot; You &apos;re no fun . You don &apos;t have positive emotion . Get lost . &quot;
And Len was wealthy enough to be able to afford a Park Avenue psychoanalyst , who for five years tried to find the sexual trauma that had somehow locked positive emotion inside of him .
But it turned out there wasn &apos;t any sexual trauma .
It turned out that -- Len grew up in Long Island and he played football and watched football , and played bridge -- Len is in the bottom five percent of what we call positive affectivities .
The question is , is Len unhappy ? And I want to say not .
Contrary to what psychology told us about the bottom 50 percent of the human race in positive affectivity , I think Len is one of the happiest people I know .
He &apos;s not consigned to the hell of unhappiness and that &apos;s because Len , like most of you , is enormously capable of flow .
When he walks onto the floor of the American Exchange at 9 : 30 in the morning , time stops for him . And it stops till the closing bell .
When the first card is played , until 10 days later , the tournament is over , time stops for Len .
And this is indeed what Mike Csikszentmihalyi has been talking about , about flow . And it &apos;s distinct from pleasure in a very important way .
Pleasure has raw feels : you know it &apos;s happening . It &apos;s thought and feeling .
But what Mike told you yesterday -- during flow , you can &apos;t feel anything .
You &apos;re one with the music . Time stops .
You have intense concentration .
And this is indeed the characteristic of what we think of as the good life .
And we think there &apos;s a recipe for it , and it &apos;s knowing what your highest strengths are .
And again , there &apos;s a valid test of what your five highest strengths are .
And then re-crafting your life to use them as much as you possibly can .
Re-crafting your work , your love , your play , your friendship , your parenting .
Just one example . One person I worked with was a bagger at Genuardi &apos;s .
Hated the job .
She &apos;s working her way through college .
Her highest strength was social intelligence , so she re-crafted bagging to make the encounter with her the social highlight of every customer &apos;s day .
Now obviously she failed .
But what she did was to take her highest strengths , and re-craft work to use them as much as possible .
What you get out of that is not smiley-ness .
You don &apos;t look like Debbie Reynolds .
You don &apos;t giggle a lot . What you get is more absorption .
So , that &apos;s the second path . The first path , positive emotion .
The second path is eudaimonian flow .
And the third path is meaning .
This is the most venerable of the happinesses , traditionally .
And meaning , in this view , consists of -- very parallel to eudaimonia -- it consists of knowing what your highest strengths are , and using them to belong to and in the service of something larger than you are .
I mentioned that for all three kinds of lives , the pleasant life , the good life , the meaningful life , people are now hard at work on the question , are there things that lastingly change those lives ?
And the answer seems to be yes . And I &apos;ll just give you some samples of it .
It &apos;s being done in a rigorous manner .
It &apos;s being done in the same way that we test drugs to see what really works .
So we do random assignment , placebo controlled , long-term studies of different interventions .
And just to sample the kind of interventions that we find have an effect , when we teach people about the pleasant life , how to have more pleasure in your life , one of your assignments is to take the mindfulness skills , the savoring skills , and you &apos;re assigned to design a beautiful day .
Next Saturday , set a day aside , design yourself a beautiful day , and use savoring and mindfulness to enhance those pleasures .
And we can show in that way that the pleasant life is enhanced .
Gratitude visit . I want you all to do this with me now , if you would .
Close your eyes .
I &apos;d like you to remember someone who did something enormously important that changed your life in a good direction , and who you never properly thanked .
The person has to be alive . OK .
Now , OK , you can open your eyes .
I hope all of you have such a person .
Your assignment , when you &apos;re learning the gratitude visit , is to write a 300-word testimonial to that person , call them on the phone in Phoenix , ask if you can visit , don &apos;t tell them why , show up at their door , you read the testimonial -- everyone weeps when this happens .
And what happens is when we test people one week later , a month later , three months later , they &apos;re both happier and less depressed .
Another example is a strength date , in which we get couples to identify their highest strengths on the strengths test , and then to design an evening in which they both use their strengths , and we find this is a strengthener of relationships .
And fun versus philanthropy .
But it &apos;s so heartening to be in a group like this , in which so many of you have turned your lives to philanthropy .
Well , my undergraduates and the people I work with haven &apos;t discovered this , so we actually have people do something altruistic and do something fun , and to contrast it .
And what you find is when you do something fun , it has a square wave walk set .
When you do something philanthropic to help another person , it lasts and it lasts .
So those are examples of positive interventions .
So , the next to last thing I want to say is we &apos;re interested in how much life satisfaction people have .
And this is really what you &apos;re about . And that &apos;s our target variable .
And we ask the question as a function of the three different lives , how much life satisfaction do you get ?
So we ask -- and we &apos;ve done this in 15 replications involving thousands of people -- to what extent does the pursuit of pleasure , the pursuit of positive emotion , the pleasant life , the pursuit of engagement , time stopping for you , and the pursuit of meaning contribute to life satisfaction ?
And our results surprised us , but they were backward of what we thought .
It turns out the pursuit of pleasure has almost no contribution to life satisfaction .
The pursuit of meaning is the strongest .
The pursuit of engagement is also very strong .
Where pleasure matters is if you have both engagement and you have meaning , then pleasure &apos;s the whipped cream and the cherry .
Which is to say , the full life -- the sum is greater than the parts , if you &apos;ve got all three .
Conversely , if you have none of the three , the empty life , the sum is less than the parts .
And what we &apos;re asking now is does the very same relationship , physical health , morbidity , how long you live and productivity , follow the same relationship ?
That is , in a corporation , is productivity a function of positive emotion , engagement and meaning ?
Is health a function of positive engagement , of pleasure , and of meaning in life ?
And there is reason to think the answer to both of those may well be yes .
So , Chris said that the last speaker had a chance to try to integrate what he heard , and so this was amazing for me . I &apos;ve never been in a gathering like this .
I &apos;ve never seen speakers stretch beyond themselves so much , which was one of the remarkable things .
But I found that the problems of psychology seemed to be parallel to the problems of technology , entertainment and design in the following way .
We all know that technology , entertainment and design have been and can be used for destructive purposes .
We also know that technology , entertainment and design can be used to relieve misery .
And by the way , the distinction between relieving misery and building happiness is extremely important .
I thought , when I first became a therapist 30 years ago , that if I was good enough to make someone not depressed , not anxious , not angry , that I &apos;d make them happy .
And I never found that . I found the best you could ever do was to get to zero .
But they were empty .
And it turns out the skills of happiness , the skills of the pleasant life , the skills of engagement , the skills of meaning , are different from the skills of relieving misery .
And so , the parallel thing holds with technology , entertainment and design , I believe .
That is , it is possible for these three drivers of our world to increase happiness , to increase positive emotion , and that &apos;s typically how they &apos;ve been used .
But once you fractionate happiness the way I do -- not just positive emotion , that &apos;s not nearly enough -- there &apos;s flow in life , and there &apos;s meaning in life .
As Laura Lee told us , design , and , I believe , entertainment and technology , can be used to increase meaning engagement in life as well .
So in conclusion , the eleventh reason for optimism , in addition to the space elevator , is that I think with technology , entertainment and design , we can actually increase the amount of tonnage of human happiness on the planet .
And if technology can , in the next decade or two , increase the pleasant life , the good life and the meaningful life , it will be good enough .
If entertainment can be diverted to also increase positive emotion , meaning , eudaimonia , it will be good enough .
And if design can increase positive emotion , eudaimonia , and flow and meaning , what we &apos;re all doing together will become good enough . Thank you .

There &apos;s so many of you .
When I was a kid , I hid my heart under the bed , because my mother said , &quot; If you &apos;re not careful , someday someone &apos;s going to break it . &quot;
Take it from me . Under the bed is not a good hiding spot .
I know because I &apos;ve been shot down so many times I get altitude sickness just from standing up for myself .
But that &apos;s what we were told .
Stand up for yourself .
And that &apos;s hard to do if you don &apos;t know who you are .
We were expected to define ourselves at such an early age , and if we didn &apos;t do it , others did it for us .
Geek . Fatty . Slut . Fag .
And at the same time we were being told what we were , we were being asked , &quot; What do you want to be when you grow up ? &quot;
I always thought that was an unfair question .
It presupposes that we can &apos;t be what we already are .
We were kids .
When I was a kid , I wanted to be a man .
I wanted a registered retirement savings plan that would keep me in candy long enough to make old age sweet .
When I was a kid , I wanted to shave .
Now , not so much .
When I was eight , I wanted to be a marine biologist .
When I was nine , I saw the movie &quot; Jaws , &quot; and thought to myself , &quot; No , thank you . &quot;
And when I was 10 , I was told that my parents left because they didn &apos;t want me .
When I was 11 , I wanted to be left alone .
When I was 12 , I wanted to die . When I was 13 , I wanted to kill a kid .
When I was 14 , I was asked to seriously consider a career path .
I said , &quot; I &apos;d like to be a writer . &quot;
And they said , &quot; Choose something realistic . &quot;
So I said , &quot; Professional wrestler . &quot;
And they said , &quot; Don &apos;t be stupid . &quot;
See , they asked me what I wanted to be , then told me what not to be .
And I wasn &apos;t the only one .
We were being told that we somehow must become what we are not , sacrificing what we are to inherit the masquerade of what we will be .
I was being told to accept the identity that others will give me .
And I wondered , what made my dreams so easy to dismiss ?
Granted , my dreams are shy , because they &apos;re Canadian .
My dreams are self-conscious and overly apologetic .
They &apos;re standing alone at the high school dance , and they &apos;ve never been kissed .
See , my dreams got called names too .
Silly . Foolish . Impossible .
But I kept dreaming .
I was going to be a wrestler . I had it all figured out .
I was going to be The Garbage Man .
My finishing move was going to be The Trash Compactor .
My saying was going to be , &quot; I &apos;m taking out the trash ! &quot;
And then this guy , Duke &quot; The Dumpster &quot; Droese , stole my entire shtick .
I was crushed , as if by a trash compactor .
I thought to myself , &quot; What now ? Where do I turn ? &quot;
Poetry .
Like a boomerang , the thing I loved came back to me .
One of the first lines of poetry I can remember writing was in response to a world that demanded I hate myself .
From age 15 to 18 , I hated myself for becoming the thing that I loathed : a bully .
When I was 19 , I wrote , &quot; I will love myself despite the ease with which I lean toward the opposite . &quot;
Standing up for yourself doesn &apos;t have to mean embracing violence .
When I was a kid , I traded in homework assignments for friendship , then gave each friend a late slip for never showing up on time , and in most cases not at all .
I gave myself a hall pass to get through each broken promise .
And I remember this plan , born out of frustration from a kid who kept calling me &quot; Yogi , &quot; then pointed at my tummy and said , &quot; Too many picnic baskets . &quot;
Turns out it &apos;s not that hard to trick someone , and one day before class , I said , &quot; Yeah , you can copy my homework , &quot; and I gave him all the wrong answers that I &apos;d written down the night before .
He got his paper back expecting a near-perfect score , and couldn &apos;t believe it when he looked across the room at me and held up a zero .
I knew I didn &apos;t have to hold up my paper of 28 out of 30 , but my satisfaction was complete when he looked at me , puzzled , and I thought to myself , &quot; Smarter than the average bear , motherfucker . &quot;
This is who I am .
This is how I stand up for myself .
When I was a kid , I used to think that pork chops and karate chops were the same thing .
I thought they were both pork chops .
And because my grandmother thought it was cute , and because they were my favorite , she let me keep doing it .
Not really a big deal .
One day , before I realized fat kids are not designed to climb trees , I fell out of a tree and bruised the right side of my body .
I didn &apos;t want to tell my grandmother about it because I was scared I &apos;d get in trouble for playing somewhere I shouldn &apos;t have been .
A few days later , the gym teacher noticed the bruise , and I got sent to the principal &apos;s office .
From there , I was sent to another small room with a really nice lady who asked me all kinds of questions about my life at home .
I saw no reason to lie .
As far as I was concerned , life was pretty good .
I told her , whenever I &apos;m sad , my grandmother gives me karate chops .
This led to a full-scale investigation , and I was removed from the house for three days , until they finally decided to ask how I got the bruises .
News of this silly little story quickly spread through the school , and I earned my first nickname : Porkchop .
To this day , I hate pork chops .
I &apos;m not the only kid who grew up this way , surrounded by people who used to say that rhyme about sticks and stones , as if broken bones hurt more than the names we got called , and we got called them all .
So we grew up believing no one would ever fall in love with us , that we &apos;d be lonely forever , that we &apos;d never meet someone to make us feel like the sun was something they built for us in their toolshed .
So broken heartstrings bled the blues , and we tried to empty ourselves so we &apos;d feel nothing .
Don &apos;t tell me that hurt less than a broken bone , that an ingrown life is something surgeons can cut away , that there &apos;s no way for it to metastasize ; it does .
She was eight years old , our first day of grade three when she got called ugly .
We both got moved to the back of class so we would stop getting bombarded by spitballs .
But the school halls were a battleground .
We found ourselves outnumbered day after wretched day .
We used to stay inside for recess , because outside was worse .
Outside , we &apos;d have to rehearse running away , or learn to stay still like statues , giving no clues that we were there .
In grade five , they taped a sign to the front of her desk that read , &quot; Beware of dog . &quot;
To this day , despite a loving husband , she doesn &apos;t think she &apos;s beautiful because of a birthmark that takes up a little less than half her face .
Kids used to say , &quot; She looks like a wrong answer that someone tried to erase , but couldn &apos;t quite get the job done . &quot;
And they &apos;ll never understand that she &apos;s raising two kids whose definition of beauty begins with the word &quot; Mom , &quot; because they see her heart before they see her skin , because she &apos;s only ever always been amazing .
He was a broken branch grafted onto a different family tree , adopted , not because his parents opted for a different destiny .
He was three when he became a mixed drink of one part left alone and two parts tragedy , started therapy in eighth grade , had a personality made up of tests and pills , lived like the uphills were mountains and the downhills were cliffs , four fifths suicidal , a tidal wave of antidepressants , and an adolescence being called &quot; Popper , &quot; one part because of the pills , 99 parts because of the cruelty .
He tried to kill himself in grade 10 when a kid who could still go home to Mom and Dad had the audacity to tell him , &quot; Get over it . &quot;
As if depression is something that could be remedied by any of the contents found in a first aid kit .
To this day , he is a stick of TNT lit from both ends , could describe to you in detail the way the sky bends in the moment before it &apos;s about to fall , and despite an army of friends who all call him an inspiration , he remains a conversation piece between people who can &apos;t understand sometimes being drug-free has less to do with addiction and more to do with sanity .
We weren &apos;t the only kids who grew up this way .
To this day , kids are still being called names .
The classics were , &quot; Hey stupid , &quot; &quot; Hey spaz . &quot;
Seems like every school has an arsenal of names getting updated every year , and if a kid breaks in a school and no one around chooses to hear , do they make a sound ?
Are they just background noise from a soundtrack stuck on repeat when people say things like , &quot; Kids can be cruel . &quot;
Every school was a big top circus tent , and the pecking order went from acrobats to lion tamers , from clowns to carnies , all of these miles ahead of who we were .
We were freaks -- lobster claw boys and bearded ladies , oddities juggling depression and loneliness , playing solitaire , spin the bottle , trying to kiss the wounded parts of ourselves and heal , but at night , while the others slept , we kept walking the tightrope .
It was practice , and yes , some of us fell .
But I want to tell them that all of this is just debris left over when we finally decide to smash all the things we thought we used to be , and if you can &apos;t see anything beautiful about yourself , get a better mirror , look a little closer , stare a little longer , because there &apos;s something inside you that made you keep trying despite everyone who told you to quit .
You built a cast around your broken heart and signed it yourself .
You signed it , &quot; They were wrong . &quot;
Because maybe you didn &apos;t belong to a group or a clique .
Maybe they decided to pick you last for basketball or everything .
Maybe you used to bring bruises and broken teeth to show-and-tell , but never told , because how can you hold your ground if everyone around you wants to bury you beneath it ?
You have to believe that they were wrong .
They have to be wrong .
Why else would we still be here ?
We grew up learning to cheer on the underdog because we see ourselves in them .
We stem from a root planted in the belief that we are not what we were called .
We are not abandoned cars stalled out and sitting empty on some highway , and if in some way we are , don &apos;t worry .
We only got out to walk and get gas .
We are graduating members from the class of We Made It , not the faded echoes of voices crying out , &quot; Names will never hurt me . &quot;
Of course they did .
But our lives will only ever always continue to be a balancing act that has less to do with pain and more to do with beauty .

&lt; url &gt; http : / / www.ted.com / talks / ben _ saunders _ why _ bother _ leaving _ the _ house.html &lt; / url &gt;
I essentially drag sledges for a living , so it doesn &apos;t take an awful lot to flummox me intellectually , but I &apos;m going to read this question from an interview earlier this year : &quot; Philosophically , does the constant supply of information steal our ability to imagine or replace our dreams of achieving ?
After all , if it is being done somewhere by someone , and we can participate virtually , then why bother leaving the house ? &quot;
I &apos;m usually introduced as a polar explorer .
I &apos;m not sure that &apos;s the most progressive or 21st-century of job titles , but I &apos;ve spent more than two percent now of my entire life living in a tent inside the Arctic Circle , so I get out of the house a fair bit .
And in my nature , I guess , I am a doer of things more than I am a spectator or a contemplator of things , and it &apos;s that dichotomy , the gulf between ideas and action that I &apos;m going to try and explore briefly .
The pithiest answer to the question &quot; why ? &quot;
that &apos;s been dogging me for the last 12 years was credited certainly to this chap , the rakish-looking gentleman standing at the back , second from the left , George Lee Mallory . Many of you will know his name .
In 1924 he was last seen disappearing into the clouds near the summit of Mt . Everest .
He may or may not have been the first person to climb Everest , more than 30 years before Edmund Hillary .
No one knows if he got to the top . It &apos;s still a mystery .
But he was credited with coining the phrase , &quot; Because it &apos;s there . &quot;
Now I &apos;m not actually sure that he did say that .
There &apos;s very little evidence to suggest it , but what he did say is actually far nicer , and again , I &apos;ve printed this . I &apos;m going to read it out .
&quot; The first question which you will ask and which I must try to answer is this : What is the use of climbing Mt . Everest ?
And my answer must at once be , it is no use .
There is not the slightest prospect of any gain whatsoever .
Oh , we may learn a little about the behavior of the human body at high altitudes , and possibly medical men may turn our observation to some account for the purposes of aviation , but otherwise nothing will come of it .
We shall not bring back a single bit of gold or silver , and not a gem , nor any coal or iron .
We shall not find a single foot of earth that can be planted with crops to raise food . So it is no use .
If you cannot understand that there is something in man which responds to the challenge of this mountain and goes out to meet it , that the struggle is the struggle of life itself upward and forever upward , then you won &apos;t see why we go .
What we get from this adventure is just sheer joy , and joy , after all , is the end of life .
We don &apos;t live to eat and make money .
We eat and make money to be able to enjoy life .
That is what life means , and that is what life is for . &quot;
Mallory &apos;s argument that leaving the house , embarking on these grand adventures is joyful and fun , however , doesn &apos;t tally that neatly with my own experience .
The furthest I &apos;ve ever got away from my front door was in the spring of 2004 . I still don &apos;t know exactly what came over me , but my plan was to make a solo and unsupported crossing of the Arctic Ocean .
I planned essentially to walk from the north coast of Russia to the North Pole , and then to carry on to the north coast of Canada .
No one had ever done this . I was 26 at the time .
A lot of experts were saying it was impossible , and my mum certainly wasn &apos;t very keen on the idea .
The journey from a small weather station on the north coast of Siberia up to my final starting point , the edge of the pack ice , the coast of the Arctic Ocean , took about five hours , and if anyone watched fearless Felix Baumgartner going up , rather than just coming down , you &apos;ll appreciate the sense of apprehension , as I sat in a helicopter thundering north , and the sense , I think if anything , of impending doom .
I sat there wondering what on Earth I had gotten myself into .
There was a bit of fun , a bit of joy .
I was 26 . I remember sitting there looking down at my sledge . I had my skis ready to go , I had a satellite phone , a pump-action shotgun in case I was attacked by a polar bear .
I remember looking out of the window and seeing the second helicopter .
We were both thundering through this incredible Siberian dawn , and part of me felt a bit like a cross between Jason Bourne and Wilfred Thesiger . Part of me felt quite proud of myself , but mostly I was just utterly terrified .
And that journey lasted 10 weeks , 72 days .
I didn &apos;t see anyone else . We took this photo next to the helicopter .
Beyond that , I didn &apos;t see anyone for 10 weeks .
The North Pole is slap bang in the middle of the sea , so I &apos;m traveling over the frozen surface of the Arctic Ocean .
NASA described conditions that year as the worst since records began .
I was dragging 180 kilos of food and fuel and supplies , about 400 pounds . The average temperature for the 10 weeks was minus 35 . Minus 50 was the coldest .
So again , there wasn &apos;t an awful lot of joy or fun to be had .
One of the magical things about this journey , however , is that because I &apos;m walking over the sea , over this floating , drifting , shifting crust of ice that &apos;s floating on top of the Arctic Ocean is it &apos;s an environment that &apos;s in a constant state of flux .
The ice is always moving , breaking up , drifting around , refreezing , so the scenery that I saw for nearly 3 months was unique to me . No one else will ever , could ever , possibly see the views , the vistas , that I saw for 10 weeks .
And that , I guess , is probably the finest argument for leaving the house .
I can try to tell you what it was like , but you &apos;ll never know what it was like , and the more I try to explain that I felt lonely , I was the only human being in 5.4 million square-miles , it was cold , nearly minus 75 with windchill on a bad day , the more words fall short , and I &apos;m unable to do it justice .
And it seems to me , therefore , that the doing , you know , to try to experience , to engage , to endeavor , rather than to watch and to wonder , that &apos;s where the real meat of life is to be found , the juice that we can suck out of our hours and days .
And I would add a cautionary note here , however .
In my experience , there is something addictive about tasting life at the very edge of what &apos;s humanly possible .
Now I don &apos;t just mean in the field of daft macho Edwardian style derring-do , but also in the fields of pancreatic cancer , there is something addictive about this , and in my case , I think polar expeditions are perhaps not that far removed from having a crack habit .
I can &apos;t explain quite how good it is until you &apos;ve tried it , but it has the capacity to burn up all the money I can get my hands on , to ruin every relationship I &apos;ve ever had , so be careful what you wish for .
Mallory postulated that there is something in man that responds to the challenge of the mountain , and I wonder if that &apos;s the case whether there &apos;s something in the challenge itself , in the endeavor , and particularly in the big , unfinished , chunky challenges that face humanity that call out to us , and in my experience that &apos;s certainly the case .
There is one unfinished challenge that &apos;s been calling out to me for most of my adult life .
Many of you will know the story .
This is a photo of Captain Scott and his team .
Scott set out just over a hundred years ago to try to become the first person to reach the South Pole .
No one knew what was there . It was utterly unmapped at the time . We knew more about the surface of the moon than we did about the heart of Antarctica .
Scott , as many of you will know , was beaten to it by Roald Amundsen and his Norwegian team , who used dogs and dogsleds . Scott &apos;s team were on foot , all five of them wearing harnesses and dragging around sledges , and they arrived at the pole to find the Norwegian flag already there , I &apos;d imagine pretty bitter and demoralized .
All five of them turned and started walking back to the coast and all five died on that return journey .
There is a sort of misconception nowadays that it &apos;s all been done in the fields of exploration and adventure .
When I talk about Antarctica , people often say , &quot; Hasn &apos;t , you know , that &apos;s interesting , hasn &apos;t that Blue Peter presenter just done it on a bike ? &quot;
Or , &quot; That &apos;s nice . You know , my grandmother &apos;s going on a cruise to Antarctica next year . You know .
Is there a chance you &apos;ll see her there ? &quot;
But Scott &apos;s journey remains unfinished .
No one has ever walked from the very coast of Antarctica to the South Pole and back again .
It is , arguably , the most audacious endeavor of that Edwardian golden age of exploration , and it seemed to me high time , given everything we have figured out in the century since from scurvy to solar panels , that it was high time someone had a go at finishing the job .
So that &apos;s precisely what I &apos;m setting out to do .
This time next year , in October , I &apos;m leading a team of three .
It will take us about four months to make this return journey .
That &apos;s the scale . The red line is obviously halfway to the pole .
We have to turn around and come back again .
I &apos;m well aware of the irony of telling you that we will be blogging and tweeting . You &apos;ll be able to live vicariously and virtually through this journey in a way that no one has ever before .
And it &apos;ll also be a four-month chance for me to finally come up with a pithy answer to the question , &quot; Why ? &quot;
And our lives today are safer and more comfortable than they have ever been . There certainly isn &apos;t much call for explorers nowadays . My career advisor at school never mentioned it as an option .
If I wanted to know , for example , how many stars were in the Milky Way , how old those giant heads on Easter Island were , most of you could find that out right now without even standing up .
And yet , if I &apos;ve learned anything in nearly 12 years now of dragging heavy things around cold places , it is that true , real inspiration and growth only comes from adversity and from challenge , from stepping away from what &apos;s comfortable and familiar and stepping out into the unknown .
In life , we all have tempests to ride and poles to walk to , and I think metaphorically speaking , at least , we could all benefit from getting outside the house a little more often , if only we could sum up the courage .
I certainly would implore you to open the door just a little bit and take a look at what &apos;s outside .
Thank you very much .

&lt; url &gt; http : / / www.ted.com / talks / al _ seckel _ says _ our _ brains _ are _ mis _ wired.html &lt; / url &gt;
We &apos;re going to talk -- my -- a new lecture , just for TED -- and I &apos;m going show you some illusions that we &apos;ve created for TED , and I &apos;m going to try to relate this to happiness . What I was thinking about with happiness is , what gives happiness -- or happiness , which I equate with joy in my particular area , and I think there &apos;s something very fundamental . And I was thinking about this . And it &apos;s in terms of both illusions and movies that we go see and jokes and magic shows is that there &apos;s something about these things where our expectations are violated in some sort of pleasing way . You go see a movie . And it has an unexpected twist -- something that you didn &apos;t expect -- and you find a joyful experience . You look at those sort of illusions in my book and it &apos;s not as what you &apos;d expect . And there &apos;s something joyful about it . And it &apos;s the same thing with jokes and all these sorts of things . So , what I &apos;m going to try and do in my lecture is go a little bit further and see if I can violate your expectations in a pleasing way . I mean , sometimes expectations that are violated are not pleasant , but I &apos;m going to try to do it in a pleasant way , in a very primal way , so I can make the audience here happy .
So I &apos;m going to show you some ways that we can violate your expectations . First of all , I want to show you the particular illusion here . I want you first of all when it pops up on the screen to notice that the two holes are perpendicular to each other . These are all perceptual tricks . These are real objects that I &apos;m going to show you . Now I &apos;m going to show you how it is done . I &apos;ve looped the film here so you can get a very interesting experience . I want you to see how this illusion is constructed , and it &apos;s going to rotate so you see that it &apos;s inside out . Now watch , as it rotates back , how quickly your perception snaps . OK now .
Watch it as it rotates back again . And this is a very bright audience , all right ? See if you can stop it from happening , even though you know 100 percent it &apos;s true that -- bam ! You can &apos;t undo it . What does that tell you about yourselves ? We &apos;re going to do it again . No doubt about it . See if you can stop it from happening . No . It &apos;s difficult .
And we can violate your expectations in a whole variety of ways about representation , about shape , about color and so forth and it &apos;s very primal . And it &apos;s an interesting question to ponder , why these things -- we find these things joyful . Why would we find them joyful ? So , here &apos;s something that Lionel did a while ago . I like these sort of little things like this .
Again , this is not an optical trick . This is what you would see . In other words , it &apos;s not a camera cut . It &apos;s a perceptual trick .
OK . We can violate your expectations about shape .
We can violate your expectations on representation -- what an image represents . What do you see here ?
How many of you here see dolphins ? Raise your hand if you see dolphins . OK , those people who raised their hands , afterwards , the rest of the audience , go talk to them , all right ? Actually , this is the best example of priming by experience that I know .
If you are a child under the age of 10 who haven &apos;t been ruined yet , you will look at this image and see dolphins . Now , some of you adults here are saying , &quot; What dolphins ? What dolphins ? &quot;
But in fact , if you reversed the figure ground -- in other words , the dark areas here -- I forgot to ask for a pointer -- but if you reverse it , you &apos;ll see a whole series of little dolphins . By the way , if you &apos;re also a student at CalTech -- they also tend to just see the dolphins . It &apos;s based on experience .
Now , something like this can be used because this is after all talk about design , too . This was done by Saatchi and Saatchi , and they actually got away with this ad in Australia . So , if you look at this ad for beer , all those people are in sort of provocative positions . But they got it passed , and actually won the Clio awards , so it &apos;s funny how you can do these things .
Remember that sort of , um . This is the joke I did when the Florida ballot was going around . You know , count the dots for Gore ; count the dots for Bush ; count &apos; em again ...
You can violate your expectations about experience . Here is an outside water fountain that I created with some friends of mine , but you can stop the water in drops and -- actually make all the drops levitate . This is something we &apos;re building for , you know , amusement parks and that kind of stuff .
Now let &apos;s take a static image . Can you see this ?
Do you see the middle section moving down and the outer sections moving up ? It &apos;s completely static .
It &apos;s a static image . How many people see this illusion ? It &apos;s completely static .
Right . Now , when -- it &apos;s interesting that when we look at an image we see , you know , color , depth , texture . And you can look at this whole scene and analyze it . You can see the woman is in closer than the wall and so forth . But the whole thing is actually flat . It &apos;s painted . It &apos;s trompe l &apos;oeil .
And it was such a good trompe l &apos;oeil that people got irritated when they tried to talk to the woman and she wouldn &apos;t respond .
Now , you can make design mistakes . Like this building in New York . So that when you see it from this side , it looks like the balconies tilt up , and when you walk around to the other side it looks like the balconies go down . So there are cases where you have mistakes in design that incorporate illusions .
Or , you take this particular un-retouched photograph . Now , interestingly enough , I get a lot of emails from people who say , &quot; Is there any perceptual difference between males and females ? &quot;
And I really say , &quot; No . &quot; I mean , women can navigate through the world just as well as males can -- and why wouldn &apos;t they ? However , this is the one illusion that women can consistently do better than males : in matching which head because they rely on fashion cues . They can match the hat .
Okay , now getting to a part -- I want to show design in illusions . I believe that the first example of illusions being used purposely was by da Vinci in this anamorphic image of an eye . So that when you saw from one little angle was like this . And this little technique got popular in the 16th century and the 17th century to disguise hidden meanings , where you could flip the image and see it from one little point of view like this .
But these are early incorporations of illusions brought to -- sort of high point with Hans Holbein &apos;s &quot; Ambassadors . &quot; And Hans Holbein worked for Henry VIII . This was hung on a wall where you could walk down from the stair and you can see this hidden skull .
All right , now I &apos;m going to show you some designers who work with illusions to give that element of surprise . One of my favorites is Scott Kim . I worked with Scott to create some illusions for TED that I hope you will enjoy . We have one here on TED and happiness .
OK now . Arthur &#91; Ganson &#93; hasn &apos;t talked yet , but his is going to be a delightful talk and he has some of his really fantastic machines outside . And so , we -- Scott created this wonderful tribute to Arthur Ganson .
Well , there &apos;s analog and digital . Thought that was appropriate here .
And figure goes to ground .
And for the musicians .
And of course , since happiness -- we want &quot; joy to the world . &quot;
Now , another great designer -- he &apos;s very well known in Japan -- Shigeo Fukuda . And he just builds some fantastic things . This is simply amazing . This is a pile of junk that when you view it from one particular angle , you see its reflection in the mirror as a perfect piano .
Pianist transforms to violinist .
This is really wild . This assemblage of forks , knives and spoons and various cutlery , welded together . It gives a shadow of a motorcycle . You learn something in the sort of thing that I do , which is there are people out there with a lot of time on their hands .
Ken Knowlton does wonderful composite images , like creating Jacques Cousteau out of seashells -- un-retouched seashells , but just by rearranging them . He did Einstein out of dice because , after all , Einstein said , &quot; God does not play dice with the universe . &quot; Bert Herzog out of un-retouched keyboards . Will Shortz , crossword puzzle . John Cederquist does these wonderful trompe l &apos;oeil cabinets .
Now , I &apos;m going to skip ahead since I &apos;m sort of running &#91; behind &#93; . I want to show you quickly what I &apos;ve created , some new type of illusions . I &apos;ve done something with taking the Pixar-type illusions . So you see these kids the same size here , running down the hall . The two table tops of the same size .
They &apos;re looking out two directions at once . You have a larger piece fitting in with a smaller . And that &apos;s something for you to think about , all right ? So you see larger pieces fitting in within smaller pieces here . Does everyone see that ? Which is impossible . You can see the two kids are looking out simultaneously out of two different directions at once . Now can you believe these two table tops are the same size and shape ? They are .
So , if you measured them , they would be . And as I say , those two figures are identical in size and shape .
And it &apos;s interesting , by doing this in this sort of rendered fashion , how much stronger the illusions are . Any case , I hope this has brought you a little joy and happiness , and if you &apos;re interested in seeing more cool effects , see me outside . I &apos;d be happy to show you lots of things .

&lt; url &gt; http : / / www.ted.com / talks / lies _ damned _ lies _ and _ statistics _ about _ tedtalks.html &lt; / url &gt;
If you go on the TED website , you can currently find there over a full week of TEDTalk videos , over 1.3 million words of transcripts and millions of user ratings .
And that &apos;s a huge amount of data .
And it got me wondering : If you took all this data and put it through statistical analysis , could you reverse engineer a TEDTalk ?
Could you create the ultimate TEDTalk ?
And also , could you create the worst possible TEDTalk that they would still let you get away with ?
To find this out , I looked at three things : I looked at the topic that you should choose , I looked at how you should deliver it and the visuals onstage .
Now , with the topic : There &apos;s a whole range of topics you can choose , but you should choose wisely , because your topic strongly correlates with how users will react to your talk .
Now , to make this more concrete , let &apos;s look at the list of top 10 words that statistically stick out in the most favorite TEDTalks and in the least favorite TEDTalks .
So if you came here to talk about how French coffee will spread happiness in our brains , that &apos;s a go .
Whereas , if you wanted to talk about your project involving oxygen , girls , aircraft -- actually , I would like to hear that talk , but statistics say it &apos;s not so good .
Oh , well .
If you generalize this , the most favorite TEDTalks are those that feature topics we can connect with , both easily and deeply , such as happiness , our own body , food , emotions .
And the more technical topics , such as architecture , materials and , strangely enough , men , those are not good topics to talk about .
How should you deliver your talk ?
TED is famous for keeping a very sharp eye on the clock , so they &apos;re going to hate me for revealing this , because , actually , you should talk as long as they will let you .
Because the most favorite TEDTalks are , on average , over 50 percent longer than the least favorite ones .
And this holds true for all ranking lists on TED.com except if you want to have a talk that &apos;s beautiful , inspiring or funny .
Then , you should be brief . But other than that , talk until they drag you off the stage .
Now , while ...
While you &apos;re pushing the clock , there &apos;s a few rules to obey .
I found these rules out by comparing the statistics of four-word phrases that appear more often in the most favorite TEDTalks as opposed to the least favorite TEDTalks .
I &apos;ll give you three examples .
First of all , I must , as a speaker , provide a service to the audience and talk about what I will give you , instead of saying what I can &apos;t have .
Secondly , it &apos;s imperative that you do not cite The New York Times .
And finally , it &apos;s okay for the speaker -- that &apos;s the good news -- to fake intellectual capacity .
If I don &apos;t understand something , I can just say , &quot; etc . , etc . &quot;
You &apos;ll all stay with me .
It &apos;s perfectly fine .
Now , let &apos;s go to the visuals .
The most obvious visual thing on stage is the speaker .
And analysis shows if you want to be among the most favorite TED speakers , you should let your hair grow a little bit longer than average , make sure you wear your glasses and be slightly more dressed-up than the average TED speaker .
Slides are okay , though you might consider going for props .
And now the most important thing , that is the mood onstage .
Color plays a very important role .
Color closely correlates with the ratings that talks get on the website .
For example , fascinating talks contain a statistically high amount of exactly this blue color , much more than the average TEDTalk .
Ingenious TEDTalks , much more this green color , etc . , et .
Now , personally , I think I &apos;m not the first one who has done this analysis , but I &apos;ll leave this to your good judgment .
So , now it &apos;s time to put it all together and design the ultimate TEDTalk .
Now , since this is TEDActive , and I learned from my analysis that I should actually give you something , I will not impose the ultimate or worst TEDTalk on you , but rather give you a tool to create your own .
And I call this tool the TEDPad .
And the TEDPad is a matrix of 100 specifically selected , highly curated sentences that you can easily piece together to get your own TEDTalk .
You only have to make one decision , and that is : Are you going to use the white version for very good TEDTalks , about creativity , human genius ?
Or are you going to go with a black version , which will allow you to create really bad TEDTalks , mostly about blogs , politics and stuff ?
So , download it and have fun with it .
Now I hope you enjoy the session .
I hope you enjoy designing your own ultimate and worst possible TEDTalks .
And I hope some of you will be inspired for next year to create this , which I really want to see .
Thank you very much .

I &apos;m here today , as June said , to talk about a project that my twin sister and I have been doing for the past three and half years .
We &apos;re crocheting a coral reef .
And it &apos;s a project that we &apos;ve actually been now joined by hundreds of people around the world , who are doing it with us . Indeed thousands of people have actually been involved in this project , in many of its different aspects .
It &apos;s a project that now reaches across three continents , and its roots go into the fields of mathematics , marine biology , feminine handicraft and environmental activism .
It &apos;s true .
It &apos;s also a project that in a very beautiful way , the development of this has actually paralleled the evolution of life on earth , which is a particularly lovely thing to be saying right here in February 2009 -- which , as one of our previous speakers told us , is the 200th anniversary of the birth of Charles Darwin .
All of this I &apos;m going to get to in the next 18 minutes , I hope .
But let me first begin by showing you some pictures of what this thing looks like .
Just to give you an idea of scale , that installation there is about six feet across , and the tallest models are about two or three feet high .
This is some more images of it .
That one on the right is about five feet high .
The work involves hundreds of different crochet models .
And indeed there are now thousands and thousands of models that people have contributed all over the world as part of this .
The totality of this project involves tens of thousands of hours of human labor -- 99 percent of it done by women .
On the right hand side , that bit there is part of an installation that is about 12 feet long .
My sister and I started this project in 2005 because in that year , at least in the science press , there was a lot of talk about global warming , and the effect that global warming was having on coral reefs .
Corals are very delicate organisms , and they are devastated by any rise in sea temperatures .
It causes these vast bleaching events that are the first signs of corals of being sick .
And if the bleaching doesn &apos;t go away -- if the temperatures don &apos;t go down -- reefs start to die .
A great deal of this has been happening in the Great Barrier Reef , particularly in coral reefs all over the world .
This is our invocation in crochet of a bleached reef .
We have a new organization together called The Institute for Figuring , which is a little organization we started to promote , to do projects about the aesthetic and poetic dimensions of science and mathematics .
And I went and put a little announcement up on our site , asking for people to join us in this enterprise .
To our surprise , one of the first people who called was the Andy Warhol Museum .
And they said they were having an exhibition about artists &apos; response to global warming , and they &apos;d like our coral reef to be part of it .
I laughed and said , &quot; Well we &apos;ve only just started it , you can have a little bit of it . &quot;
So in 2007 we had an exhibition , a small exhibition of this crochet reef .
And then some people in Chicago came along and they said , &quot; In late 2007 , the theme of the Chicago Humanities Festival is global warming . And we &apos;ve got this 3,000 square-foot gallery and we want you to fill it with your reef . &quot;
And I , naively by this stage , said , &quot; Oh , yes , sure . &quot;
Now I say &quot; naively &quot; because actually my profession is as a science writer .
What I do is I write books about the cultural history of physics .
I &apos;ve written books about the history of space , the history of physics and religion , and I write articles for people like the New York Times and the L.A. Times .
So I had no idea what it meant to fill a 3,000 square-foot gallery .
So I said yes to this proposition .
And I went home , and I told my sister Christine .
And she nearly had a fit because Christine is a professor at one of L.A. &apos; s major art colleges , CalArts , and she knew exactly what it meant to fill a 3,000 square-foot gallery .
She thought I &apos;d gone off my head .
But she went into crochet overdrive .
And to cut a long story short , eight months later we did fill the Chicago Cultural Center &apos;s 3,000 square foot gallery .
By this stage the project had taken on a viral dimension of its own , which got completely beyond us .
The people in Chicago decided that as well as exhibiting our reefs , what they wanted to do was have the local people there make a reef .
So we went and taught the techniques . We did workshops and lectures .
And the people in Chicago made a reef of their own .
And it was exhibited alongside ours .
There were hundreds of people involved in that .
We got invited to do the whole thing in New York , and in London , and in Los Angeles .
In each of these cities , the local citizens , hundreds and hundreds of them , have made a reef .
And more and more people get involved in this , most of whom we &apos;ve never met .
So the whole thing has sort of morphed into this organic , ever-evolving creature , that &apos;s actually gone way beyond Christine and I.
Now some of you are sitting here thinking , &quot; What planet are these people on ?
Why on earth are you crocheting a reef ?
Woolenness and wetness aren &apos;t exactly two concepts that go together .
Why not chisel a coral reef out of marble ?
Cast it in bronze . &quot;
But it turns out there is a very good reason why we are crocheting it because many organisms in coral reefs have a very particular kind of structure .
The frilly crenulated forms that you see in corals , and kelps , and sponges and nudibranchs , is a form of geometry known as hyperbolic geometry .
And the only way that mathematicians know how to model this structure is with crochet . It happens to be a fact .
It &apos;s almost impossible to model this structure any other way , and it &apos;s almost impossible to do it on computers .
So what is this hyperbolic geometry that corals and sea slugs embody ?
The next few minutes is , we &apos;re all going to get raised up to the level of a sea slug .
This sort of geometry revolutionized mathematics when it was first discovered in the 19th century .
But not until 1997 did mathematicians actually understand how they could model it .
In 1997 a mathematician at Cornell , Daina Taimina , made the discovery that this structure could actually be done in knitting and crochet .
The first one she did was knitting .
But you get too many stitches on the needle . So she quickly realized crochet was the better thing .
But what she was doing was actually making a model of a mathematical structure , that many mathematicians had thought it was actually impossible to model .
And indeed they thought that anything like this structure was impossible per se .
Some of the best mathematicians spent hundreds of years trying to prove that this structure was impossible .
So what is this impossible hyperbolic structure ?
Before hyperbolic geometry , mathematicians knew about two kinds of space : Euclidean space , and spherical space .
And they have different properties .
Mathematicians like to characterize things by being formalist .
You all have a sense of what a flat space is , Euclidean space is .
But mathematicians formalize this in a particular way .
And what they do is , they do it through the concept of parallel lines .
So here we have a line and a point outside the line .
And Euclid said , &quot; How can I define parallel lines ?
I ask the question , how many lines can I draw through the point but never meet the original line ? &quot;
And you all know the answer . Does someone want to shout it out ?
One . Great . Okay .
That &apos;s our definition of a parallel line .
It &apos;s a definition really of Euclidean space .
But there is another possibility that you all know of : spherical space .
Think of the surface of a sphere -- just like a beach ball , the surface of the Earth .
I have a straight line on my spherical surface .
And I have a point outside the line . How many straight lines can I draw through the point but never meet the original line ?
What do we mean to talk about a straight line on a curved surface ?
Now mathematicians have answered that question .
They &apos;ve understood there is a generalized concept of straightness , it &apos;s called a geodesic .
And on the surface of a sphere , a straight line is the biggest possible circle you can draw .
So it &apos;s like the equator or the lines of longitude .
So we ask the question again , &quot; How many straight lines can I draw through the point , but never meet the original line ? &quot;
Does someone want to guess ?
Zero . Very good .
Now mathematicians thought that was the only alternative .
It &apos;s a bit suspicious isn &apos;t it ? There is two answers to the question so far , Zero and one .
Two answers ? There may possibly be a third alternative .
To a mathematician if there are two answers , and the first two are zero and one , there is another number that immediately suggests itself as the third alternative .
Does anyone want to guess what it is ?
Infinity . You all got it right . Exactly .
There is , there &apos;s a third alternative .
This is what it looks like .
There &apos;s a straight line , and there is an infinite number of lines that go through the point and never meet the original line .
This is the drawing .
This nearly drove mathematicians bonkers because , like you , they &apos;re sitting there feeling bamboozled .
Thinking , how can that be ? You &apos;re cheating . The lines are curved .
But that &apos;s only because I &apos;m projecting it onto a flat surface .
Mathematicians for several hundred years had to really struggle with this .
How could they see this ?
What did it mean to actually have a physical model that looked like this ?
It &apos;s a bit like this : imagine that we &apos;d only ever encountered Euclidean space .
Then our mathematicians come along and said , &quot; There &apos;s this thing called a sphere , and the lines come together at the north and south pole . &quot;
But you don &apos;t know what a sphere looks like .
And someone that comes along and says , &quot; Look here &apos;s a ball . &quot;
And you go , &quot; Ah ! I can see it . I can feel it .
I can touch it . I can play with it . &quot;
And that &apos;s exactly what happened when Daina Taimina in 1997 , showed that you could crochet models in hyperbolic space .
Here is this diagram in crochetness .
I &apos;ve stitched Euclid &apos;s parallel postulate on to the surface .
And the lines look curved .
But look , I can prove to you that they &apos;re straight because I can take any one of these lines , and I can fold along it .
And it &apos;s a straight line .
So here , in wool , through a domestic feminine art , is the proof that the most famous postulate in mathematics is wrong .
And you can stitch all sorts of mathematical theorems onto these surfaces .
The discovery of hyperbolic space ushered in the field of mathematics that is called non-Euclidean geometry .
And this is actually the field of mathematics that underlies general relativity and is actually ultimately going to show us about the shape of the universe .
So there is this direct line between feminine handicraft , Euclid and general relativity .
Now , I said that mathematicians thought that this was impossible .
Here &apos;s two creatures who &apos;ve never heard of Euclid &apos;s parallel postulate -- didn &apos;t know it was impossible to violate , and they &apos;re simply getting on with it .
They &apos;ve been doing it for hundreds of millions of years .
I once asked the mathematicians why it was that mathematicians thought this structure was impossible when sea slugs have been doing it since the Silurian age .
Their answer was interesting .
They said , &quot; Well I guess there aren &apos;t that many mathematicians sitting around looking at sea slugs . &quot;
And that &apos;s true . But it also goes deeper than that .
It also says a whole lot of things about what mathematicians thought mathematics was , what they thought it could and couldn &apos;t do , what they thought it could and couldn &apos;t represent .
Even mathematicians , who in some sense are the freest of all thinkers , literally couldn &apos;t see not only the sea slugs around them , but the lettuce on their plate -- because lettuces , and all those curly vegetables , they also are embodiments of hyperbolic geometry .
And so in some sense they literally , they had such a symbolic view of mathematics , they couldn &apos;t actually see what was going on on the lettuce in front of them .
It turns out that the natural world is full of hyperbolic wonders .
And so , too , we &apos;ve discovered that there is an infinite taxonomy of crochet hyperbolic creatures .
We started out , Chrissy and I and our contributors , doing the simple mathematically perfect models .
But we found that when we deviated from the specific setness of the mathematical code that underlies it -- the simple algorithm crochet three , increase one -- when we deviated from that and made embellishments to the code , the models immediately started to look more natural .
And all of our contributors , who are an amazing collection of people around the world , do their own embellishments .
As it were , we have this ever-evolving , crochet taxonomic tree of life .
Just as the morphology and the complexity of life on earth is never ending , little embellishments and complexifications in the DNA code lead to new things like giraffes , or orchids -- so too , do little embellishments in the crochet code lead to new and wondrous creatures in the evolutionary tree of crochet life .
So this project really has taken on this inner organic life of its own .
There is the totality of all the people who have come to it .
And their individual visions , and their engagement with this mathematical mode .
We have these technologies . We use them .
But why ? What &apos;s at stake here ? What does it matter ?
For Chrissy and I , one of the things that &apos;s important here is that these things suggest the importance and value of embodied knowledge .
We live in a society that completely tends to valorize symbolic forms of representation -- algebraic representations , equations , codes .
We live in a society that &apos;s obsessed with presenting information in this way , teaching information in this way .
But through this sort of modality , crochet , other plastic forms of play -- people can be engaged with the most abstract , high-powered , theoretical ideas , the kinds of ideas that normally you have to go to university departments to study in higher mathematics , which is where I first learned about hyperbolic space .
But you can do it through playing with material objects .
One of the ways that we &apos;ve come to think about this is that what we &apos;re trying to do with the Institute for Figuring and projects like this , we &apos;re trying to have kindergarten for grown-ups .
And kindergarten was actually a very formalized system of education , established by a man named Friedrich Froebel , who was a crystallographer in the 19th century .
He believed that the crystal was the model for all kinds of representation .
He developed a radical alternative system of engaging the smallest children with the most abstract ideas through physical forms of play .
And he is worthy of an entire talk on his own right .
The value of education is something that Froebel championed , through plastic modes of play .
We live in a society now where we have lots of think tanks , where great minds go to think about the world .
They write these great symbolic treatises called books , and papers , and op-ed articles .
We want to propose , Chrissy and I , through The Institute for Figuring , another alternative way of doing things , which is the play tank .
And the play tank , like the think tank , is a place where people can go and engage with great ideas .
But what we want to propose , is that the highest levels of abstraction , things like mathematics , computing , logic , etc . -- all of this can be engaged with , not just through purely cerebral algebraic symbolic methods , but by literally , physically playing with ideas .
Thank you very much .

&lt; title &gt; Margaret Wertheim : The beautiful math of coral &lt; / title &gt;
&lt; description &gt; Margaret Wertheim leads a project to re-create the creatures of the coral reefs using a crochet technique invented by a mathematician -- celebrating the amazements of the reef , and deep-diving into the hyperbolic geometry underlying coral creation . &lt; / description &gt;

&lt; url &gt; http : / / www.ted.com / talks / seth _ godin _ on _ sliced _ bread.html &lt; / url &gt;
I &apos;m going to give you four specific examples -- and I &apos;m going to cover at the end -- about how a company called Silk tripled their sales by doing one thing , how an artist named Jeff Koons went from being a nobody to making a whole bunch of money and having a lot of impact , to how Frank Gehry redefined what it meant to be an architect .
And one of my biggest failures as a marketer in the last few years , a record label I started that had a CD called &quot; Sauce . &quot;
Before I can do that I &apos;ve got to tell you about sliced bread , and a guy named Otto Rohwedder .
Now , before sliced bread was invented in the 1910s I wonder what they said ?
Like the greatest invention since ... the telegraph or something .
But this guy named Otto Rohwedder invented sliced bread , and he focused , like most inventors did , on the patent part and the making part .
And the thing about the invention of sliced bread is this -- that for the first 15 years after sliced bread was available no one bought it ; no one knew about it ; it was a complete and total failure .
And the reason is that until Wonder came along and figured out how to spread the idea of sliced bread , no one wanted it .
That the success of sliced bread , like the success of almost everything we &apos;ve been talking about at this conference , is not always about what the patent is like , or what the factory is like -- it &apos;s about can you get your idea to spread , or not .
And I think that the way you &apos;re going to get what you want , or cause the change that you want to change , to happen , is that you &apos;ve got to figure out a way to get your ideas to spread .
And it doesn &apos;t matter to me whether you &apos;re running a coffee shop or you &apos;re an intellectual , or you &apos;re in business , or you &apos;re flying hot air balloons .
I think that all this stuff applies to everybody regardless of what we do .
That what we are living in is a century of idea diffusion .
That people who can spread ideas , regardless of what those ideas are , win .
And when I talk about it I usually pick business because they make the best pictures that you can put in your presentation , and because it &apos;s the easiest sort of way to keep score .
But I want you to forgive me when I use these examples because I &apos;m talking about anything that you decide to spend your time to do .
At the heart of spreading ideas is TV and stuff like TV .
TV and mass media made it really easy to spread ideas in a certain way .
I call it the &quot; TV-industrial complex . &quot;
The way the TV-industrial complex works , is you buy some ads -- interrupt some people -- that gets you distribution .
You use the distribution you get to sell more products .
You take the profit from that to buy more ads .
And it goes around and around and around , the same way that military-industrial complex worked a long time ago .
And that model of , and we heard it yesterday , if we could only get onto the homepage of Google , if we could only figure out how to get promoted there , if we could only figure out how to grab that person by the throat , and tell them about what we want to do .
If we do that then everyone would pay attention , and we would win .
Well , this TV-industrial complex informed my entire childhood and probably yours .
I mean , all of these products succeeded because someone figured out how to touch people in a way they weren &apos;t expecting , in a way they didn &apos;t necessarily want , with an ad , over and over and over again until they bought it .
And the thing that &apos;s happened is , they canceled the TV-industrial complex .
That just over the last few years , what anybody who markets anything has discovered is that it &apos;s not working the way that it used to .
This picture is really fuzzy , I apologize ; I had a bad cold when I took it .
But the product in the blue box in the center is my poster child .
Right . I go to the deli ; I &apos;m sick ; I need to buy some medicine .
The brand manager for that blue product spent 100 million dollars trying to interrupt me in one year .
100 million dollars interrupting me with TV commercials and magazine ads and spam and coupons and shelving allowances and spiff -- all so I could ignore every single message .
And I ignored every message because I don &apos;t have a pain reliever problem .
I buy the stuff in the yellow box because I always have .
And I &apos;m not going to invest a minute of my time to solve her problem , because I don &apos;t care .
Here &apos;s a magazine called &quot; Hydrate . &quot; It &apos;s 180 pages about water .
Right . Articles about water , ads about water .
Imagine what the world was like 40 years ago when it was just the Saturday Evening Post and Time and Newsweek .
Now there are magazines about water .
New products from Coke Japan -- water salad .
OK . Coke Japan comes out with a new product every three weeks , because they have no idea what &apos;s going to work and what &apos;s not .
I couldn &apos;t have written this better myself . It came out four days ago -- I circled the important parts so you can see them here .
They &apos;ve come out ... Arby &apos;s is going to spend 85 million dollars promoting an oven mitt with the voice of Tom Arnold , hoping that that will get people to go to Arby &apos;s and buy a roast beef sandwich .
Now , I had tried to imagine what could possibly be in an animated TV commercial featuring Tom Arnold , that would get you to get in your car , drive across town and buy a roast beef sandwich .
Now , this is Copernicus , and he was right , when he was talking to anyone who needs to hear your idea .
The world revolves around me . Me , me , me , me , me . My favorite person -- me .
I don &apos;t want to get email from anybody ; I want to get &quot; memail . &quot;
So consumers , and I don &apos;t just mean people who buy stuff at the Safeway ; I mean people at the Defense Department who might buy something , or people at , you know , the New Yorker who might print your article .
Consumers don &apos;t care about you at all ; they just don &apos;t care .
Part of the reason is -- they &apos;ve got way more choices than they used to , and way less time .
And in a world where we have too many choices and too little time , the obvious thing to do is just ignore stuff .
And my parable here is you &apos;re driving down the road and you see a cow , and you keep driving because you &apos;ve seen cows before .
Cows are invisible . Cows are boring .
Who &apos;s going to stop and pull over and say -- oh , look , a cow . Nobody .
But if the cow was purple -- isn &apos;t that a great special effect ?
I could do that again if you want it .
If the cow was purple , you &apos;d notice it for a while .
I mean , if all cows were purple you &apos;d get bored with those , too .
The thing that &apos;s going to decide what gets talked about , what gets done , what gets changed , what gets purchased , what gets built , is : is it remarkable ?
And &quot; remarkable &quot; is a really cool word because we think it just means neat , but it also means -- worth making a remark about .
And that is the essence of where idea diffusion is going .
That two of the hottest cars in the United States is a 55,000-dollar giant car , big enough to hold a mini in its trunk .
People are paying full price for both , and the only thing they have in common is that they don &apos;t have anything in common .
Every week the number one best-selling DVD in America changes .
It &apos;s never &quot; The Godfather ; &quot; it &apos;s never &quot; Citizen Kane ; &quot; it &apos;s always some third rate movie with some second rate star .
But the reason it &apos;s number one is because that &apos;s the week it came out .
Because it &apos;s new , because it &apos;s fresh .
Because people saw it and said -- I didn &apos;t know that was there -- and they noticed it .
Two of the big success stories of the last 20 years in retail -- one sells things that are super-expensive in a blue box , and one sells things that are as cheap as they can make them .
The only thing they have in common is that they &apos;re different .
We &apos;re now in the fashion business , no matter what we do for a living , we &apos;re in the fashion business .
And the thing is , people in the fashion business know what it &apos;s like to be in the fashion business -- they &apos;re used to it .
The rest of us have to figure out how to think that way .
How to understand that it &apos;s not about interrupting people with big full-page ads , or insisting on meetings with people .
But it &apos;s a totally different sort of process that determines which ideas spread , and which ones don &apos;t .
This chair -- they sold a billion dollars &apos; worth of Aeron chairs by reinventing what it meant to sell a chair .
They turned a chair from something the purchasing department bought , to something that was a status symbol about where you sat at work .
This guy , Lionel Poilane , the most famous baker in the world -- he died two and a half months ago , and he was a hero of mine and a dear friend .
He lived in Paris . Last year he sold 10 million dollars &apos; worth of French bread .
Every loaf baked in a bakery he owned , by one baker at a time , in a wood-fired oven .
And when Lionel started his bakery the French pooh-pooh-ed it .
They didn &apos;t want to buy his bread . It didn &apos;t look like &quot; French bread . &quot;
It wasn &apos;t what they expected .
It was neat ; it was remarkable ; and slowly it spread from one person to another person until finally , it became the official bread of three-star restaurants in Paris .
Now he &apos;s in London , and he ships by FedEx all around the world .
What marketers used to do is make average products for average people .
That &apos;s what mass marketing is .
Smooth out the edges ; go for the center ; that &apos;s the big market .
They would ignore the geeks , and God forbid , the laggards .
It was all about going for the center .
But in a world where the TV-industrial complex is broken , I don &apos;t think that &apos;s a strategy we want to use any more .
I think the strategy we want to use is to not market to these people because they &apos;re really good at ignoring you .
But market to these people because they care .
These are the people who are obsessed with something .
And when you talk to them they &apos;ll listen because they like listening -- it &apos;s about them .
And if you &apos;re lucky , they &apos;ll tell their friends on the rest of the curve , and it &apos;ll spread .
It &apos;ll spread to the entire curve .
They have something I call &quot; otaku &quot; -- it &apos;s a great Japanese word .
It describes the desire of someone who &apos;s obsessed to say , drive across Tokyo to try a new ramen noodle place , because that &apos;s what they do : they get obsessed with it .
To make a product , to market an idea , to come up with any problem you want to solve that doesn &apos;t have a constituency with an otaku , is almost impossible .
Instead , you have to find a group that really , desperately cares about what it is you have to say .
Talk to them and make it easy for them to tell their friends .
There &apos;s a hot sauce otaku , but there &apos;s no mustard otaku .
That &apos;s why there &apos;s lots and lots and lots of kinds of hot sauces , and not so many kinds of mustard .
Not because it &apos;s hard to make interesting mustard -- you can make interesting mustard -- but people don &apos;t because no one &apos;s obsessed with it , and thus no one tells their friends .
Krispy Kreme has figured this whole thing out .
Krispy Kreme has a strategy , and what they do is , they enter a city , they talk to the people with otaku , and then they spread through the city to the people who &apos;ve just crossed the street .
This yoyo right here cost 112 dollars , but it sleeps for 12 minutes .
Not everybody wants it but they don &apos;t care .
They want to talk to the people who do , and maybe it &apos;ll spread .
These guys make the loudest car stereo in the world .
It &apos;s as loud as a 747 jet . You can &apos;t get in the car ; it &apos;s got bulletproof glass on the windows because they &apos;ll blow out the windshield otherwise .
But the fact remains that when someone wants to put a couple of speakers in their car , if they &apos;ve got the otaku or they &apos;ve heard from someone who does , they go ahead and they pick this .
It &apos;s really simple -- you sell to the people who are listening , and maybe , just maybe those people tell their friends .
So when Steve Jobs talks to 50,000 people at his keynote , right , who are all tuned in from 130 countries watching his two-hour commercial -- that &apos;s the only thing keeping his company in business -- is that those 50,000 people care desperately enough to watch a two-hour commercial , and then tell their friends .
Pearl Jam , 96 albums released in the last two years .
Every one made a profit . How ?
They only sell them on their website .
Those people who buy them on the website have the otaku , and then they tell their friends , and it spreads and it spreads .
This hospital crib cost 10,000 dollars , 10 times the standard .
But hospitals are buying it faster than any other model .
Hard Candy nail polish , doesn &apos;t appeal to everybody , but to the people who love it , they talk about it like crazy .
This paint can right here saved the Dutch Boy paint company , making them a fortune . It costs 35 percent more than regular paint because Dutch Boy made a can that people talk about , because it &apos;s remarkable .
They didn &apos;t just slap a new ad on the product ; they changed what it meant to build a paint product .
AmIhotornot.com -- everyday 250,000 people go to this site , run by two volunteers , and I can tell you they are hard graders , and they didn &apos;t get this way by advertising a lot .
They got this way by being remarkable , sometimes a little too remarkable .
And this picture frame has a cord going out the back , and you plug it into the wall .
My father has this on his desk , and he sees his grandchildren everyday , changing constantly .
And every single person who walks into his office hears the whole story of how this thing ended up on his desk .
And one person at a time , the idea spreads .
These are not diamonds , not really .
They &apos;re made from &quot; cremains . &quot;
After you &apos;re cremated you can have yourself made into a gem .
Oh , you like my ring ? It &apos;s my grandmother .
Fastest-growing business in the whole mortuary industry .
But you don &apos;t have to be Ozzie Osborne -- you don &apos;t have to be super-outrageous to do this .
What you have to do is figure out what people really want and give it to them .
A couple of quick rules to wrap up .
The first one is : Design is free when you get to scale .
And the people who come up with stuff that &apos;s remarkable more often than not figure out how to put design to work for them .
Number two : The riskiest thing you can do now is be safe .
Proctor and Gamble knows this , right ?
The whole model of being Proctor and Gamble is always about average products for average people .
That &apos;s risky . The safe thing to do now is to be at the fringes , be remarkable .
And being very good is one of the worst things you can possibly do .
Very good is boring . Very good is average .
It doesn &apos;t matter whether you &apos;re making a record album , or you &apos;re an architect , or you have a tract on sociology .
If it &apos;s very good , it &apos;s not going to work , because no one &apos;s going to notice it .
So my three stories .
Silk . Put a product that does not need to be in the refrigerated section next to the milk in the refrigerated section .
Sales tripled . Why ?
Milk , milk , milk , milk , milk -- not milk .
For the people who were there and looking at that section , it was remarkable .
They didn &apos;t triple their sales with advertising ; they tripled it by doing something remarkable .
That is a remarkable piece of art . You don &apos;t have to like it , but a 40-foot tall dog made out of bushes in the middle of New York City is remarkable .
Frank Gehry didn &apos;t just change a museum ; he changed an entire city &apos;s economy by designing one building that people from all over the world went to see .
Now , at countless meetings at , you know , the Portland City Council , or who knows where , they said , we need an architect -- can we get Frank Gehry ?
Because he did something that was at the fringes .
And my big failure ? I came out with an entire record album and hopefully a whole bunch of record albums in SACD format -- this remarkable new format -- and I marketed it straight to people with 20,000-dollar stereos .
People with 20,000-dollar stereos don &apos;t like new music .
So what you need to do is figure out who does care .
Who is going to raise their hand and say , &quot; I want to hear what you &apos;re doing next , &quot; and sell something to them .
The last example I want to give you .
This is a map of Soap Lake , Washington .
As you can see , if that &apos;s nowhere , it &apos;s in the middle of it .
But they do have a lake .
And people used to come from miles around to swim in the lake .
They don &apos;t anymore . So the founding fathers said , &quot; We &apos;ve got some money to spend .
What can we build here ? &quot; And like most committees , they were going to build something pretty safe .
And then an artist came to them -- this is a true artist &apos;s rendering -- he wants to build a 55-foot tall lava lamp in the center of town .
That &apos;s a purple cow ; that &apos;s something worth noticing .
I don &apos;t know about you but if they build it , that &apos;s where I &apos;m going to go .
Thank you very much for your attention .

You know , when Chris first approached me to speak at TED , I said no , because I felt like I wasn &apos;t going to be able to make that personal connection , you know , that I wanted to .
It &apos;s such a large conference .
But he explained to me that he was in a bind , and that he was having trouble finding the kind of sex appeal and star power that the conference was known for -- so I said fine , Ted -- I mean Chris . I &apos;ll come on two conditions .
One -- I want to speak as early in the morning as possible .
And two -- I want to pick the theme for TED 2006 .
And luckily he agreed . And the theme , in two years , is going to be &quot; Cute Pictures Of Puppies . &quot;
I invented the Placebo Camera .
It doesn &apos;t actually take pictures , but it &apos;s a hell of a lot cheaper , and you still feel like you were there .
&quot; Dear Sir , Good day , compliments of the day , and my best wishes to you and family . I know this letter will come to you surprisingly , but let it not be a surprise to you , for nature has a way of arriving unannounced , and , as an adage says , originals are very hard to find , but their echoes sound louder . So I decided to contact you myself , for you to assure me of safety and honesty , if I have to entrust any amount of money under your custody .
I am Mister Michael Bangoora , the son of late Mister Tiamu Bangoora -- who was the Minister of Finance in Sierra Leone -- but was killed during a civil war .
Knowing your country to be economical conducive for investment , and your people as transparent and trustworthy to engage in business , on which premise I write you .
Before my father death , he had the sum of 23 million United States dollars , which he kept away from the rebel leaders during the course of the war .
This fund was supposed to be used for the rehabilitation of water reserves all over the country , before the outbreak of war . When the war broke out , the rebel leader demanded that the fund be given to him , my father insisted it was not in his possession , and he was killed because of his refusal to release the fund .
Meanwhile , my mother and I is the only person who knows about the fund because my father always confide in me .
I quickly made an arrangement with a Red Cross relief worker , who used his official van to transport the money to Lungi Airport , Freetown , although he did not know the real contents of the box .
The fund was deposited as a family reassure , in a safe , reliable security company in Dakar , Senegal , where I was only given temporary asylum .
I do not wish to invest the money in Senegal due to unfavorable economic climate , and so close to my country .
The only assistance I need from you , which I know you would do for me , are the following : one , be a silent partner and receive the funds in your account in trust ; two , provide a bank account under your control to which the funds will be remitted ; three , receive the funds into your account in trust ; take out your commission ; and leave the rest of the money until I arrive , after the transfer is complete .
Sincerely , Mister Michael Bangoora . &quot;
This is really embarrassing .
I was told backstage that I have 18 minutes .
I only prepared 15 .
So if it &apos;s cool , I &apos;d like to just wait for three .
I &apos;m really sorry .
What &apos;s your name ?
Mark Serfaas . It &apos;s pretty cool , huh ? Pursuing happiness .
Are you a virgin ? Virgin ?
I mean -- no , I mean like in the TED sense ?
Are you ? Oh , yeah . So what are you , like , a thousand , two thousand , somewhere in there ? Huh ? Oh ?
You don &apos;t know what I &apos;m talking about ?
Ah , Mark -- Serfaas .
1,860 -- am I good ?
And that &apos;s nothing to be ashamed of .
That &apos;s nothing to be ashamed of .
Yeah , I was hanging out with some Google guys last night .
Really cool , we were getting wasted .
And they were telling me that Google software has gotten so advanced that , based on your interaction with Google over your lifetime , they can actually predict what you are going to say next .
And I was like , &quot; Get the fuck out of here . That &apos;s crazy . &quot;
But they said , &quot; No , but don &apos;t show anyone , &quot; but they slipped up .
And they said that I could just type in &quot; What was I going to say next ? &quot;
and my name , and it would tell me . And I have to tell you , right now , this is an unadulterated piece of software , this is a real Internet browser and this is an actual Google site , and we &apos;re going to test it out live today .
What was I going to say next ? And &quot; Ze Frank &quot; -- that &apos;s me .
Am I feeling lucky ?
Am I feeling lucky ?
Audience : Yes .
Ze Frank : Oh . Amazing .
In March of 2001 -- I filmed myself dancing to Madonna &apos;s &quot; Justify My Love . &quot;
On a Thursday , I sent out a link to a website that featured those clips to 17 of my closest friends , as part of my -- an invitation to my -- an invitation to my th -- th -- 26th birthday party .
By Monday , over a million people were coming to this site a day .
Within a week , I received a call from Earthlink that said , due to a 10 cents per megabyte overage charge , I owed them 30,000 dollars .
Needless to say , I was able to leave my job .
And , finally , you know , become freelance .
But some people refer to me more of -- as , like , an Internet guru or -- swami .
I -- I knew I had something .
I &apos;d basically distilled a very difficult-to-explain and complex philosophy , which I won &apos;t get into here , because it &apos;s a little too deep for all of you , but -- it &apos;s about what makes websites popular , and , you know , it &apos;s -- it &apos;s unfortunate that I don &apos;t have more time .
Maybe I can come back next year , or something like that .
I &apos;m obsessed with email . I get a lot of it .
Four years later , I still get probably two or three hundred emails a day from people I don &apos;t know , and it &apos;s been an amazing opportunity to kind of get to know different cultures , you know ?
It &apos;s like a microscope to the rest of the world .
You can kind of peer into other people &apos;s lives , and I also feel like I get a lot of inspiration from the average user .
For example , somebody wrote me .
They said , &quot; Hey Ze , if you ever come to Boulder , you should rock out with us , &quot; and I said , &quot; Why wait ? &quot;
And they said , &quot; Hey Ze , thanks for rocking out , but I meant the kind of rocking out where we &apos;d be naked . &quot;
And that was embarrassing .
But you know , it &apos;s kind of a collaboration between me and the fans , so I said , &quot; Sure . &quot;
I hear a lot of you whispering .
And I know what you &apos;re saying . You &apos;re saying , &quot; Holy crap , how is his presentation so smooth ? &quot;
And I have to say that it &apos;s not all me this year .
I guess Chris has to take some credit here , because in years past , I guess there &apos;s been some sort of subpar speakers at TED . I don &apos;t know .
And so , this year , Chris sent us a TED Conference simulator .
Which really allowed us as speakers to get there , in the trenches , and practice at home so that we would be ready for this experience .
And I gotta say that , you know , it &apos;s really , really great to be here .
I &apos;d like to tell all of you a little joke . Not just the good stuff , though .
You can do heckler mode .
Voice : Hey , moron , get off the stage .
ZF : You get off the stage .
Voice : We want Malcolm Gladwell .
In case you run over time .
I &apos;d -- just one last thing I &apos;d like to say , I &apos;d , really -- like to thank all of you for being here .
And frog mode .
&quot; Ah , the first time that I made love to a rock shrimp ... &quot;
It &apos;s true . Some people say to me , they say , &quot; Ze , you &apos;re doing all this stuff , this Internet stuff , and you &apos;re not making any money .
&quot; Why ? &quot; And I say , &quot; Mom , Dad -- &quot; I &apos;m trying . &quot; You know , I don &apos;t know if you &apos;re all aware of this , but the video -- the video game market , kids are playing these video games , oh , but , supposedly , there &apos;s tons of money .
I mean , like , I think , 100,000 dollars or so a year is being spent on these things . So I decided to try my hand .
I came up with a few games .
This is called &quot; Atheist . &quot;
I figured it &apos;d be popular with the young kids .
Look , I &apos;ll move around and say some things .
So that didn &apos;t go over so well .
I don &apos;t really understand why you &apos;re laughing .
Should have done this before I tried to pitch it .
&quot; Buddhist , &quot; of course , looks very , very similar to &quot; Atheist . &quot;
But you come back as a duck .
And this is great because , you know , for a quarter , you can play this for a long time .
And Chris had said in an email that , you know , we should really bring something new to TED , something that we haven &apos;t shown anyone .
So , I made this for TED . It &apos;s &quot; Christian . &quot;
It &apos;s the third in the series .
I &apos;m hoping it &apos;s going to do well this year .
Do you have a preference ? Good choice .
So you can wait for the Second Coming -- which is -- a random number between one and 500 million .
So really , what are we talking about here ? Oh , tech joy .
Tech joy , to me , means something , because I get a lot of joy out of tech .
And in fact , making things using technology -- and I &apos;m being serious here , even though I &apos;m using my sarcastic voice -- I won &apos;t -- hold on . Making things , you know -- making things actually does give me a lot of joy .
It &apos;s the process of creation that keeps me sort of a bubble and a half above perpetual anxiety in my life , and it &apos;s that feeling of being about 80 percent complete on a project -- where you know you still have something to do , but it &apos;s not finished , and you &apos;re not starting something -- that really fills my entire life .
And so , what I &apos;ve done is , I started getting interested in creating online social spaces to share that feeling with people who don &apos;t consider themselves artists .
We &apos;re in a culture of guru-ship . It &apos;s so hard to use some software because , you know , it &apos;s unapproachable , people feel like they have to read the manual .
So I try to -- -- I try to create these very minimal activities that allow people to express themselves , and , hopefully -- whoa , I &apos;m like -- on the page , but it doesn &apos;t exist .
It &apos;s , like -- seriously , though -- I try to create meaningful environments for people to express themselves .
Here I created a contest called , &quot; When Office Supplies Attack , &quot; which , I think , really resonated with the -- working population .
Over 500 entries in three weeks , toilet paper fashion .
Again , people from all over the country doing -- the watch is particularly incredible .
Online drawing tools -- you &apos;ve probably seen a lot of them .
I think they &apos;re wonderful .
I think it &apos;s a chance for people to get to play with crayons and all that kind of stuff . But I &apos;m interested in the process , the process of creating , as the real event that I &apos;m interested in .
And the problem is that a lot of people suck at drawing , and they get bummed out at this , sort of , you know , stick figure , awful little thing that they created .
And eventually , it just makes them stop playing with it , or draw , you know , they draw penises and things like that .
So , the Scribbler is an attempt to create a generative tool .
In other words , it &apos;s a helping tool .
You can draw your simple stick figure , and then it collaborates with you to create , sort of , like , a post-war German etching .
So you can -- in fact , it &apos;s tuned to be better at drawing things that look worse . So , we go ahead , and we start scribbling , and -- so the idea is that you can really , you know , partake in this process , but watch something really crappy look beautiful .
And here are some of my favorites . This is the little trap marionette that was submitted to me . Here we are , very cool .
Darling . Beautiful stuff .
I mean this is incredible . This is an 11-year-old girl -- drew this and submitted it . It &apos;s just gorgeous .
I &apos;m -- I &apos;m dead serious here . I &apos;m actually -- this is not a joke .
But , I think , it &apos;s a -- it &apos;s a really fun and wonderful thing .
So this is called the &quot; Fiction Project . &quot; This is an online space , which is -- it &apos;s basically a refurbished message board that encourages collaborative fiction writing .
These are haikus .
None of the haikus were written by the same person , and in fact , no line was -- you know , each line is contributed by a different person at a different -- at a different time .
I think that the &quot; now tied up , tied down , mistress cruel approaches me , now tied down , it &apos;s up . &quot;
It &apos;s -- it &apos;s an amazing way , and I &apos;ll tell you , if you come home , and your spouse , or whoever it is , says , &quot; Let &apos;s talk &quot; -- that , like , chills you to the very core .
But it &apos;s peripheral activities , like these , that allow people to get together , doing fun things .
They actually get to know each other , and it &apos;s sort of like low-threshold peripheral activities that I think are the key to bringing up some of our bonding social capital that we &apos;re lacking . And very , very quickly -- I love puppets . Here &apos;s a puppet .
It dances to music . Lotte Reiniger , an amazing shadow puppeteer in the &apos; 20s , that started doing more elaborate things .
I became interested in puppets , and I just want to show one last thing to you .
Oh , this is how you make puppets .
Ladies and gentlemen , Mr. Ze Frank .

&lt; url &gt; http : / / www.ted.com / talks / brian _ skerry _ reveals _ ocean _ s _ glory _ and _ horror.html &lt; / url &gt;
I would like to share with you this morning some stories about the ocean through my work as a still photographer for National Geographic magazine .
I guess I became an underwater photographer and a photojournalist because I fell in love with the sea as a child .
And I wanted to tell stories about all the amazing things I was seeing underwater , incredible wildlife and interesting behaviors .
And after even 30 years of doing this , after 30 years of exploring the ocean , I never cease to be amazed at the extraordinary encounters that I have while I &apos;m at sea .
But more and more frequently these days I &apos;m seeing terrible things underwater as well , things that I don &apos;t think most people realize .
And I &apos;ve been compelled to turn my camera towards these issues to tell a more complete story .
I want people to see what &apos;s happening underwater , both the horror and the magic .
The first story that I did for National Geographic , where I recognized the ability to include environmental issues within a natural history coverage , was a story I proposed on harp seals .
The story I wanted to do initially was just a small focus to look at the few weeks each year where these animals migrate down from the Canadian arctic to the Gulf of St. Lawrence in Canada to engage in courtship , mating and to have their pups .
And all of this is played out against the backdrop of transient pack ice that moves with wind and tide .
And because I &apos;m an underwater photographer , I wanted to do this story from both above and below , to make pictures like this that show one of these little pups making its very first swim in the icy 29-degree water .
But as I got more involved in the story , I realized that there were two big environmental issues I couldn &apos;t ignore .
The first was that these animals continue to be hunted , killed with hakapiks at about eight , 15 days old .
It actually is the largest marine mammal slaughter on the planet , with hundreds of thousands of these seals being killed every year .
But as disturbing as that is , I think the bigger problem for harp seals is the loss of sea ice due to global warming .
This is an aerial picture that I made that shows the Gulf of St. Lawrence during harp seal season .
And even though we see a lot of ice in this picture , there &apos;s a lot of water as well , which wasn &apos;t there historically .
And the ice that is there is quite thin .
The problem is that these pups need a stable platform of solid ice in order to nurse from their moms .
They only need 12 days from the moment they &apos;re born until they &apos;re on their own .
But if they don &apos;t get 12 days , they can fall into the ocean and die .
This is a photo that I made showing one of these pups that &apos;s only about five or seven days old -- still has a little bit of the umbilical cord on its belly -- that has fallen in because of the thin ice , and the mother is frantically trying to push it up to breathe and to get it back to stable purchase .
This problem has continued to grow each year since I was there .
I read that last year the pup mortality rate was 100 percent in parts of the Gulf of St. Lawrence .
So , clearly , this species has a lot of problems going forward .
This ended up becoming a cover story at National Geographic .
And it received quite a bit of attention .
And with that , I saw the potential to begin doing other stories about ocean problems .
So I proposed a story on the global fish crisis , in part because I had personally witnessed a lot of degradation in the ocean over the last 30 years , but also because I read a scientific paper that stated that 90 percent of the big fish in the ocean have disappeared in the last 50 or 60 years .
These are the tuna , the billfish and the sharks .
When I read that , I was blown away by those numbers .
I thought this was going to be headline news in every media outlet , but it really wasn &apos;t , so I wanted to do a story that was a very different kind of underwater story .
I wanted it to be more like war photography , where I was making harder-hitting pictures that showed readers what was happening to marine wildlife around the planet .
The first component of the story that I thought was essential , however , was to give readers a sense of appreciation for the ocean animals that they were eating .
You know , I think people go into a restaurant , and somebody orders a steak , and we all know where steak comes from , and somebody orders a chicken , and we know what a chicken is , but when they &apos;re eating bluefin sushi , do they have any sense of the magnificent animal that they &apos;re consuming ?
These are the lions and tigers of the sea .
In reality , these animals have no terrestrial counterpart ; they &apos;re unique in the world .
These are animals that can practically swim from the equator to the poles and can crisscross entire oceans in the course of a year .
If we weren &apos;t so efficient at catching them , because they grow their entire life , would have 30-year-old bluefin out there that weigh a ton .
But the truth is we &apos;re way too efficient at catching them , and their stocks have collapsed worldwide .
This is the daily auction at the Tsukiji Fish Market that I photographed a couple years ago .
And every single day these tuna , bluefin like this , are stacked up like cordwood , just warehouse after warehouse .
As I wandered around and made these pictures , it sort of occurred to me that the ocean &apos;s not a grocery store , you know .
We can &apos;t keep taking without expecting serious consequences as a result .
I also , with the story , wanted to show readers how fish are caught , some of the methods that are used to catch fish , like a bottom trawler , which is one of the most common methods in the world .
This was a small net that was being used in Mexico to catch shrimp , but the way it works is essentially the same everywhere in the world .
You have a large net in the middle with two steel doors on either end .
And as this assembly is towed through the water , the doors meet resistance with the ocean , and it opens the mouth of the net , and they place floats at the top and a lead line on the bottom .
And this just drags over the bottom , in this case to catch shrimp .
But as you can imagine , it &apos;s catching everything else in its path as well .
And it &apos;s destroying that precious benthic community on the bottom , things like sponges and corals , that critical habitat for other animals .
This photograph I made of the fisherman holding the shrimp that he caught after towing his nets for one hour .
So he had a handful of shrimp , maybe seven or eight shrimp , and all those other animals on the deck of the boat are bycatch .
These are animals that died in the process , but have no commercial value .
So this is the true cost of a shrimp dinner , maybe seven or eight shrimp and 10 pounds of other animals that had to die in the process .
And to make that point even more visual , I swam under the shrimp boat and made this picture of the guy shoveling this bycatch into the sea as trash and photographed this cascade of death , you know , animals like guitarfish , bat rays , flounder , pufferfish , that only an hour before , were on the bottom of the ocean , alive , but now being thrown back as trash .
I also wanted to focus on the shark fishing industry because , currently on planet Earth , we &apos;re killing over 100 million sharks every single year .
But before I went out to photograph this component , I sort of wrestled with the notion of how do you make a picture of a dead shark that will resonate with readers You know , I think there &apos;s still a lot of people out there who think the only good shark is a dead shark .
But this one morning I jumped in and found this thresher that had just recently died in the gill net .
And with its huge pectoral fins and eyes still very visible , it struck me as sort of a crucifixion , if you will .
This ended up being the lead picture in the global fishery story in National Geographic .
And I hope that it helped readers to take notice of this problem of 100 million sharks .
And because I love sharks -- I &apos;m somewhat obsessed with sharks -- I wanted to do another , more celebratory , story about sharks , as a way of talking about the need for shark conservation .
So I went to the Bahamas because there &apos;re very few places in the world where sharks are doing well these days , but the Bahamas seem to be a place where stocks were reasonably healthy , largely due to the fact that the government there had outlawed longlining several years ago .
And I wanted to show several species that we hadn &apos;t shown much in the magazine and worked in a number of locations .
One of the locations was this place called Tiger Beach , in the northern Bahamas where tiger sharks aggregate in shallow water .
This is a low-altitude photograph that I made showing our dive boat with about a dozen of these big old tiger sharks sort of just swimming around behind .
But the one thing I definitely didn &apos;t want to do with this coverage was to continue to portray sharks as something like monsters .
I didn &apos;t want them to be overly threatening or scary .
And with this photograph of a beautiful 15-feet , probably 14-feet , I guess , female tiger shark , I sort of think I got to that goal , where she was swimming with these little barjacks off her nose , and my strobe created a shadow on her face .
And I think it &apos;s a gentler picture , a little less threatening , a little more respectful of the species .
I also searched on this story for the elusive great hammerhead , an animal that really hadn &apos;t been photographed much until maybe about seven or 10 years ago .
It &apos;s a very solitary creature .
But this is an animal that &apos;s considered data deficient by science in both Florida and in the Bahamas .
You know , we know almost nothing about them .
We don &apos;t know where they migrate to or from , where they mate , where they have their pups , and yet , hammerhead populations in the Atlantic have declined about 80 percent in the last 20 to 30 years .
You know , we &apos;re losing them faster than we can possibly find them .
This is the oceanic whitetip shark , an animal that is considered the fourth most dangerous species , if you pay attention to such lists .
But it &apos;s an animal that &apos;s about 98 percent in decline throughout most of its range .
Because this is a pelagic animal and it lives out in the deeper water , and because we weren &apos;t working on the bottom , I brought along a shark cage here , and my friend , shark biologist Wes Pratt is inside the cage .
You &apos;ll see that the photographer , of course , was not inside the cage here , so clearly the biologist is a little smarter than the photographer I guess .
And lastly with this story , I also wanted to focus on baby sharks , shark nurseries .
And I went to the island of Bimini , in the Bahamas , to work with lemon shark pups .
This is a photo of a lemon shark pup , and it shows these animals where they live for the first two to three years of their lives in these protective mangroves .
This is a very sort of un-shark-like photograph .
It &apos;s not what you typically might think of as a shark picture .
But , you know , here we see a shark that &apos;s maybe 10 or 11 inches long swimming in about a foot of water .
But this is crucial habitat and it &apos;s where they spend the first two , three years of their lives , until they &apos;re big enough to go out on the rest of the reef .
After I left Bimini , I actually learned that this habitat was being bulldozed to create a new golf course and resort .
And other recent stories have looked at single , flagship species , if you will , that are at risk in the ocean as a way of talking about other threats .
One such story I did documented the leatherback sea turtle .
This is the largest , widest-ranging , deepest-diving and oldest of all turtle species .
Here we see a female crawling out of the ocean under moonlight on the island of Trinidad .
These are animals whose lineage dates back about 100 million years .
And there was a time in their lifespan where they were coming out of the water to nest and saw Tyrannosaurus rex running by .
And today , they crawl out and see condominiums .
But despite this amazing longevity , they &apos;re now considered critically endangered .
In the Pacific , where I made this photograph , their stocks have declined about 90 percent in the last 15 years .
This is a photograph that shows a hatchling about to taste saltwater for the very first time beginning this long and perilous journey .
Only one in a thousand leatherback hatchlings will reach maturity .
But that &apos;s due to natural predators like vultures that pick them off on a beach or predatory fish that are waiting offshore .
Nature has learned to compensate with that , and females have multiple clutches of eggs to overcome those odds .
But what they can &apos;t deal with is anthropogenic stresses , human things , like this picture that shows a leatherback caught at night in a gill net .
I actually jumped in and photographed this , and with the fisherman &apos;s permission , I cut the turtle out , and it was able to swim free .
But , you know , thousands of other leatherbacks each year are not so fortunate , and the species &apos; future is in great danger .
Another charismatic megafauna species that I worked with is the story I did on the right whale .
And essentially , the story is this with right whales , that about a million years ago , there was one species of right whale on the planet , but as land masses moved around and oceans became isolated , the species sort of separated , and today we have essentially two distinct stocks .
We have the Southern right whale that we see here and the North Atlantic right whale that we see here with a mom and calf off the coast of Florida .
Now , both species were hunted to the brink of extinction by the early whalers , but the Southern right whales have rebounded a lot better because they &apos;re located in places farther away from human activity .
The North Atlantic right whale is listed as the most endangered species on the planet today because they are urban whales ; they live along the east coast of North America , United States and Canada , and they have to deal with all these urban ills .
This photo shows an animal popping its head out at sunset off the coast of Florida .
You can see the coal burning plant in the background .
They have to deal with things like toxins and pharmaceuticals that are flushed out into the ocean , and maybe even affecting their reproduction .
They also get entangled in fishing gear .
This is a picture that shows the tail of a right whale .
And those white markings are not natural markings .
These are entanglement scars .
72 percent of the population has such scars , but most don &apos;t shed the gear , things like lobster traps and crab pots .
They hold on to them , and it eventually kills them .
And the other problem is they get hit by ships .
And this was an animal that was struck by a ship in Nova Scotia , Canada being towed in , where they did a necropsy to confirm the cause of death , which was indeed a ship strike .
So all of these ills are stacking up against these animals and keeping their numbers very low .
And to draw a contrast with that beleaguered North Atlantic population , I went to a new pristine population of Southern right whales that had only been discovered about 10 years ago in the sub-Antarctic of New Zealand , a place called the Auckland Islands .
I went down there in the winter time .
And these are animals that had never seen humans before , and I was one of the first people they probably had ever seen .
And I got in the water with them , and I was amazed at how curious they were .
This photograph shows my assistant standing on the bottom at about 70 feet and one of these amazingly beautiful , 45-foot , 70-ton whales , like a city bus just swimming up , you know .
They were in perfect condition , very fat and healthy , robust , no entanglement scars , the way they &apos;re supposed to look .
You know , I read that the pilgrims , when they landed at Plymouth Rock in Massachusetts in 1620 , wrote that you could walk across Cape Cod Bay on the backs of right whales .
And we can &apos;t go back and see that today , but maybe we can preserve what we have left .
And I wanted to close this program with a story of hope , a story I did on marine reserves as sort of a solution to the problem of overfishing , the global fish crisis story .
I settled on working in the country of New Zealand because New Zealand was rather progressive , and is rather progressive in terms of protecting their ocean .
And I really wanted this story to be about three things : I wanted it to be about abundance , about diversity and about resilience .
And one of the first places I worked was a reserve called Goat Island in Leigh of New Zealand .
What the scientists there told me was that when protected this first marine reserve in 1975 , they hoped and expected that certain things might happen .
For example , they hoped that certain species of fish like the New Zealand snapper would return because they had been fished to the brink of commercial extinction .
And they did come back . What they couldn &apos;t predict was that other things would happen .
For example , these fish predate on sea urchins , and when the fish were all gone , all anyone ever saw underwater was just acres and acres of sea urchins .
But when the fish came back and began predating and controlling the urchin population , low and behold , kelp forests emerged in shallow water .
And that &apos;s because the urchins eat kelp .
So when the fish control the urchin population , the ocean was restored to its natural equilibrium .
You know , this is probably how the ocean looked here one or 200 years ago , but nobody was around to tell us .
I worked in other parts of New Zealand as well , in beautiful , fragile , protected areas like in Fiordland , where this sea pen colony was found .
Little blue cod swimming in for a dash of color .
In the northern part of New Zealand , I dove in the blue water , where the water &apos;s a little warmer , and photographed animals like this giant sting ray swimming through an underwater canyon .
Every part of the ecosystem in this place seems very healthy , from tiny , little animals like a nudibrank crawling over encrusting sponge or a leatherjacket that is a very important animal in this ecosystem because it grazes on the bottom and allows new life to take hold .
And I wanted to finish with this photograph , a picture I made on a very stormy day in New Zealand when I just laid on the bottom amidst a school of fish swirling around me .
And I was in a place that had only been protected about 20 years ago .
And I talked to divers that had been diving there for many years , and they said that the marine life was better here today than it was in the 1960s .
And that &apos;s because it &apos;s been protected , that it has come back .
So I think the message is clear .
The ocean is , indeed , resilient and tolerant to a point , but we must be good custodians .
I became an underwater photographer because I fell in love with the sea , and I make pictures of it today because I want to protect it , and I don &apos;t think it &apos;s too late .
Thank you very much .

&lt; url &gt; http : / / www.ted.com / talks / michael _ norton _ how _ to _ buy _ happiness.html &lt; / url &gt;
So I want to talk today about money and happiness , which are two things that a lot of us spend a lot of our time thinking about , either trying to earn them or trying to increase them .
And a lot of us resonate with this phrase .
So we see it in religions and self-help books , that money can &apos;t buy happiness .
And I want to suggest today that , in fact , that &apos;s wrong .
I &apos;m at a business school , so that &apos;s what we do .
So that &apos;s wrong , and , in fact , if you think that , you &apos;re actually just not spending it right .
So that instead of spending it the way you usually spend it , maybe if you spent it differently , that might work a little bit better .
And before I tell you the ways that you can spend it that will make you happier , let &apos;s think about the ways we usually spend it that don &apos;t , in fact , make us happier .
We had a little natural experiment .
So CNN , a little while ago , wrote this interesting article on what happens to people when they win the lottery .
It turns out people think when they win the lottery their lives are going to be amazing .
This article &apos;s about how their lives get ruined .
So what happens when people win the lottery is , number one , they spend all the money and go into debt , and number two , all of their friends and everyone they &apos;ve ever met find them and bug them for money .
And it ruins their social relationships , in fact .
So they have more debt and worse friendships than they had before they won the lottery .
What was interesting about the article was people started commenting on the article , readers of the thing .
And instead of talking about how it had made them realize that money doesn &apos;t lead to happiness , everyone instantly started saying , &quot; You know what I would do if I won the lottery ... ? &quot;
and fantasizing about what they &apos;d do .
And here &apos;s just two of the ones we saw that are just really interesting to think about .
One person wrote in , &quot; When I win , I &apos;m going to buy my own little mountain and have a little house on top . &quot;
And another person wrote , &quot; I would fill a big bathtub with money and get in the tub while smoking a big fat cigar and sipping a glass of champagne . &quot;
This is even worse now : &quot; Then I &apos;d have a picture taken and dozens of glossies made .
Anyone begging for money or trying to extort from me would receive a copy of the picture and nothing else . &quot;
And so many of the comments were exactly of this type , where people got money and , in fact , it made them antisocial .
So I told you that it ruins people &apos;s lives and that their friends bug them .
It also , money often makes us feel very selfish and we do things only for ourselves .
Well maybe the reason that money doesn &apos;t make us happy is that we &apos;re always spending it on the wrong things , and in particular , that we &apos;re always spending it on ourselves .
And we thought , I wonder what would happen if we made people spend more of their money on other people .
So instead of being antisocial with your money , what if you were a little more prosocial with your money ?
And we thought , let &apos;s make people do it and see what happens .
So let &apos;s have some people do what they usually do and spend money on themselves , and let &apos;s make some people give money away , and measure their happiness and see if , in fact , they get happier .
So the first way that we did this .
On one Vancouver morning , we went out on the campus at University of British Columbia and we approached people and said , &quot; Do you want to be in an experiment ? &quot;
They said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
We asked them how happy they were , and then we gave them an envelope .
And one of the envelopes had things in it that said , &quot; By 5 : 00 pm today , spend this money on yourself . &quot;
So we gave some examples of what you could spend it on .
Other people , in the morning , got a slip of paper that said , &quot; By 5 : 00 pm today , spend this money on somebody else . &quot;
Also inside the envelope was money .
And we manipulated how much money we gave them .
So some people got this slip of paper and five dollars .
Some people got this slip of paper and 20 dollars .
We let them go about their day . They did whatever they wanted to do .
We found out that they did in fact spend it in the way that we asked them to .
We called them up at night and asked them , &quot; What &apos;d you spend it on , and how happy do you feel now ? &quot;
What did they spend it on ?
Well these are college undergrads , so a lot of what they spent it on for themselves were things like earrings and makeup .
One woman said she bought a stuffed animal for her niece .
People gave money to homeless people .
Huge effect here of Starbucks .
So if you give undergraduates five dollars , it looks like coffee to them and they run over to Starbucks and spend it as fast as they can .
But some people bought a coffee for themselves , the way they usually would , but other people said that they bought a coffee for somebody else .
So the very same purchase , just targeted toward yourself or targeted toward somebody else .
What did we find when we called them back at the end of the day ?
People who spent money on other people got happier .
People who spent money on themselves , nothing happened .
It didn &apos;t make them less happy , it just didn &apos;t do much for them .
And the other thing we saw is the amount of money doesn &apos;t matter that much .
So people thought that 20 dollars would be way better than five dollars .
In fact , it doesn &apos;t matter how much money you spent .
What really matters is that you spent it on somebody else rather than on yourself .
We see this again and again when we give people money to spend on other people instead of on themselves .
Of course , these are undergraduates in Canada -- not the world &apos;s most representative population .
They &apos;re also fairly wealthy and affluent and all these other sorts of things .
We wanted to see if this holds true everywhere in the world or just among wealthy countries .
So we went , in fact , to Uganda and ran a very similar experiment .
So imagine , instead of just people in Canada , we said , &quot; Name the last time you spent money on yourself or other people .
Describe it . How happy did it make you ? &quot;
Or in Uganda , &quot; Name the last time you spent money on yourself or other people and describe that . &quot;
And then we asked them how happy they are again .
And what we see is sort of amazing because there &apos;s human universals on what you do with your money and then real cultural differences on what you do as well .
So for example , one guy from Uganda says this .
He said , &quot; I called a girl I wished to love . &quot;
They basically went out on a date , and he says at the end that he didn &apos;t &quot; achieve &quot; her up till now .
Here &apos;s a guy from Canada .
Very similar thing .
&quot; I took my girlfriend out for dinner .
We went to a movie , we left early , and then went back to her room for ... &quot; only cake -- just a piece of cake .
Human universal -- so you spend money on other people , you &apos;re being nice to them .
Maybe you have something in mind , maybe not .
But then we see extraordinary differences .
So look at these two .
This is a woman from Canada .
We say , &quot; Name a time you spent money on somebody else . &quot;
She says , &quot; I bought a present for my mom .
I drove to the mall in my car , bought a present , gave it to my mom . &quot;
Perfectly nice thing to do .
It &apos;s good to get gifts for people that you know .
Compare that to this woman from Uganda .
&quot; I was walking and met a long-time friend whose son was sick with malaria .
They had no money , they went to a clinic and I gave her this money . &quot;
This isn &apos;t $ 10,000 , it &apos;s the local currency .
So it &apos;s a very small amount of money , in fact .
But enormously different motivations here .
This is a real medical need , literally a life-saving donation .
Above , it &apos;s just kind of , I bought a gift for my mother .
What we see again though is that the specific way that you spend on other people isn &apos;t nearly as important as the fact that you spend on other people in order to make yourself happy , which is really quite important .
So you don &apos;t have to do amazing things with your money to make yourself happy .
You can do small , trivial things and yet still get these benefits from doing this .
These are only two countries .
We also wanted to go even broader and look at every country in the world if we could to see what the relationship is between money and happiness .
We got data from the Gallup Organization , which you know from all the political polls that have been happening lately .
They ask people , &quot; Did you donate money to charity recently ? &quot;
and they ask them , &quot; How happy are you with your life in general ? &quot;
And we can see what the relationship is between those two things .
Are they positively correlated ? Giving money makes you happy .
Or are they negatively correlated ?
On this map , green will mean they &apos;re positively correlated and red means they &apos;re negatively correlated .
And you can see , the world is crazily green .
So in almost every country in the world where we have this data , people who give money to charity are happier people that people who don &apos;t give money to charity .
I know you &apos;re all looking at that red country in the middle .
I would be a jerk and not tell you what it is , but in fact , it &apos;s Central African Republic .
You can make up stories . Maybe it &apos;s different there for some reason or another .
Just below that to the right is Rwanda though , which is amazingly green .
So almost everywhere we look we see that giving money away makes you happier than keeping it for yourself .
What about your work life , which is where we spend all the rest of our time when we &apos;re not with the people we know .
We decided to infiltrate some companies and do a very similar thing .
So these are sales teams in Belgium .
They work in teams ; they go out and sell to doctors and try to get them to buy drugs .
So we can look and see how well they sell things as a function of being a member of a team .
Some teams , we give people on the team some money for themselves and say , &quot; Spend it however you want on yourself , &quot; just like we did with the undergrads in Canada .
But other teams we say , &quot; Here &apos;s 15 euro .
Spend it on one of your teammates this week .
Buy them something as a gift or a present and give it to them .
And then we can see , well now we &apos;ve got teams that spend on themselves and we &apos;ve got these prosocial teams who we give money to make the team a little bit better .
The reason I have a ridiculous pinata there is one of the teams pooled their money and bought a pinata , and they all got around and smashed the pinata and all the candy fell out and things like that .
A very silly , trivial thing to do , but think of the difference on a team that didn &apos;t do that at all , that got 15 euro , put it in their pocket , maybe bought themselves a coffee , or teams that had this prosocial experience where they all bonded together to buy something and do a group activity .
What we see is that , in fact , the teams that are prosocial sell more stuff than the teams that only got money for themselves .
And one way to think about it is for every 15 euro you give people for themselves , they put it in their pocket , they don &apos;t do anything different than they did before .
You don &apos;t get any money from that .
You actually lose money because it doesn &apos;t motivate them to perform any better .
But when you give them 15 euro to spend on their teammates , they do so much better on their teams that you actually get a huge win on investing this kind of money .
And I realize that you &apos;re probably thinking to yourselves , this is all fine , but there &apos;s a context that &apos;s incredibly important for public policy and I can &apos;t imagine it would work there .
And basically that if he doesn &apos;t show me that it works here , I don &apos;t believe anything he said .
And I know what you &apos;re all thinking about are dodgeball teams .
This was a huge criticism that we got to say , if you can &apos;t show it with dodgeball teams , this is all stupid .
So we went out and found these dodgeball teams and infiltrated them .
And we did the exact same thing as before .
So some teams , we give people on the team money , they spend it on themselves .
Other teams , we give them money to spend on their dodgeball teammates .
The teams that spend money on themselves are just the same winning percentages as they were before .
The teams that we give the money to spend on each other , they become different teams and , in fact , they dominate the league by the time they &apos;re done .
Across all of these different contexts -- your personal life , you work life , even silly things like intramural sports -- we see spending on other people has a bigger return for you than spending on yourself .
And so I &apos;ll just say , I think if you think money can &apos;t buy happiness you &apos;re not spending it right .
The implication is not you should buy this product instead of that product and that &apos;s the way to make yourself happier .
It &apos;s in fact , that you should stop thinking about which product to buy for yourself and try giving some of it to other people instead .
And we luckily have an opportunity for you .
DonorsChoose.org is a non-profit for mainly public school teachers in low-income schools .
They post projects , so they say , &quot; I want to teach Huckleberry Finn to my class and we don &apos;t have the books , &quot; or &quot; I want a microscope to teach my students science and we don &apos;t have a microscope . &quot;
You and I can go on and buy it for them .
The teacher writes you a thank you note . The kids write you a thank you note .
Sometimes they send you pictures of them using the microscope .
It &apos;s an extraordinary thing .
Go to the website and start yourself on the process of thinking , again , less about &quot; How can I spend money on myself ? &quot;
and more about &quot; If I &apos;ve got five dollars or 15 dollars , what can I do to benefit other people ? &quot;
Because ultimately when you do that , you &apos;ll find that you &apos;ll benefit yourself much more .
Thank you .

We are today talking about moral persuasion .
What is moral and immoral in trying to change people &apos;s behaviors by using technology and using design ?
And I don &apos;t know what you expect , but when I was thinking about that issue , I early on realized what I &apos;m not able to give you are answers .
I &apos;m not able to tell you what is moral or immoral because we &apos;re living in a pluralist society .
My values can be radically different from your values .
Which means that what I consider moral or immoral based on that might not necessarily be what you consider moral or immoral .
But I also realized that there is one thing that I could give you .
And that is what this guy behind me gave the world -- Socrates .
It is questions .
What I can do and what I would like to do with you is give you , like that initial question , a set of questions to figure out for yourself , layer by layer , like peeling an onion , getting at the core of what you believe is moral or immoral persuasion .
And I &apos;d like to do that with a couple of examples of technologies where people have used game elements to get people to do things .
So it &apos;s a first very simple , a very obvious question I would like to give you : What are your intentions if you are designing something ?
And obviously intentions are not the only thing , so here is another example for one of these applications .
There are a couple of these kinds of eco-dashboards right now -- so dashboards built into cars which try to motivate you to drive more fuel efficiently .
This here is Nissan &apos;s MyLeaf , where your driving behavior is compared with the driving behavior of other people , so you can compete for who drives around the most fuel efficiently .
And these things are very effective , it turns out , so effective that they motivate people to engage in unsafe driving behaviors -- like not stopping on a red headlight .
Because that way you have to stop and restart the engine , and that would use quite some fuel , wouldn &apos;t it ?
So despite this being a very well-intended application , obviously there was a side effect of that .
And here &apos;s another example for one of these side effects .
Commendable : a site that allows parents to give their kids little badges for doing the things that parents want their kids to do -- like tying their shoes .
And at first that sounds very nice , very benign , well intended .
But it turns out , if you look into research on people &apos;s mindset , that caring about outcomes , caring about public recognition , caring about these kinds of public tokens of recognition is not necessarily very helpful for your long-term psychological well-being .
It &apos;s better if you care about learning something .
It &apos;s better when you care about yourself than how you appear in front of other people .
So that kind of motivational tool that is used actually in and of itself has a long-term side effect in that every time we use a technology that uses something like public recognition or status , we &apos;re actually positively endorsing this as a good and a normal thing to care about -- that way , possibly having a detrimental effect on the long-term psychological well-being of ourselves as a culture .
So that &apos;s a second , very obvious question : What are the effects of what you &apos;re doing ?
The effects that you &apos;re having with the device , like less fuel , as well as the effects of the actual tools you &apos;re using to get people to do things -- public recognition .
Now is that all -- intention , effect ?
Well there are some technologies which obviously combine both .
Both good long-term and short-term effects and a positive intention like Fred Stutzman &apos;s Freedom , where the whole point of that application is , well , we &apos;re usually so bombarded with calls and requests by other people , with this device you can shut off the Internet connectivity of your PC of choice for a preset amount of time to actually get some work done .
And I think most of us will agree , well that &apos;s something well intended and also has good consequences .
In the words of Michel Foucault , &quot; It is a technology of the self . &quot;
It is a technology that empowers the individual to determine its own life course , to shape itself .
But the problem is , as Foucault points out , that every technology of the self has a technology of domination as its flip side .
As you see in today &apos;s modern liberal democracies , the society , the state , not only allows us to determine our self , to shape our self , it also demands it of us .
It demands that we optimize ourselves , that we control ourselves , that we self-manage continuously because that &apos;s the only way in which such a liberal society works .
These technologies want us to stay in the game that society has devised for us .
They want us to fit in even better .
They want us to optimize ourselves to fit in .
Now I don &apos;t say that is necessarily a bad thing .
I just think that this example points us to a general realization , and that is no matter what technology or design you look at , even something we consider as well intended and as good in its effects -- like Stutzman &apos;s Freedom -- comes with certain values embedded in it .
And we can question these values .
We can question : Is it a good thing that all of us continuously self-optimize ourselves to fit better into that society ?
Or to give you another example , what about a piece of persuasive technology that convinces Muslim women to wear their headscarves ?
Is that a good or a bad technology in its intentions or in its effects ?
Well that basically depends on the kind of values that you bring to bear to make these kinds of judgments .
So that &apos;s a third question : What values do you use to judge ?
And speaking of values , I &apos;ve noticed that in the discussion about moral persuasion online , and when I &apos;m talking with people , more often than not there is a weird bias .
And that bias is that we &apos;re asking , is this or that &quot; still &quot; ethical ?
Is it &quot; still &quot; permissible ?
We &apos;re asking things like , Is this Oxfam donation form -- where the regular monthly donation is the preset default and people , maybe without intending it , are that way encouraged or nudged into giving a regular donation instead of a one-time donation -- is that still permissible ?
Is it still ethical ?
We &apos;re fishing at the low end .
But in fact , that question &quot; Is it still ethical ? &quot;
is just one way of looking at ethics .
Because if you look at the beginning of ethics in Western culture , you see a very different idea of what ethics also could be .
For Aristotle , ethics was not about the question , is that still good , or is it bad ?
Ethics was about the question of how to live life well .
And he put that in the word &quot; arete , &quot; which we , from the &#91; Ancient Greek &#93; , translate as &quot; virtue . &quot;
But really it means excellence .
It means living up to your own full potential as a human being .
And that is an idea that , I think , that Paul Richard Buchanan nicely put in a recent essay where he said , &quot; Products are vivid arguments about how we should live our lives . &quot;
Our designs are not ethical or unethical in that they &apos;re using ethical or unethical means of persuading us .
They have a moral component just in the kind of vision and the aspiration of the good life that they present to us .
And if you look into the designed environment around us with that kind of lens , asking , &quot; What is the vision of the good life that our products , our design , present to us ? &quot; , then you often get the shivers , because of how little we expect of each other , of how little we actually seem to expect of our life and what the good life looks like .
So that &apos;s the fourth question I &apos;d like to leave you with : What vision of the good life do your designs convey ?
And speaking of design , you notice that I already broadened the discussion .
Because it &apos;s not just persuasive technology that we &apos;re talking about here , it &apos;s any piece of design that we put out here in the world .
I don &apos;t know whether you know the great communication researcher Paul Watzlawick who , back in the &apos; 60s , made the argument we cannot not communicate .
Even if we choose to be silent , we chose to be silent . We &apos;re communicating something by choosing to be silent .
And in the same way that we cannot not communicate , we cannot not persuade .
Whatever we do or refrain from doing , whatever we put out there as a piece of design into the world has a persuasive component .
It tries to affect people .
It puts a certain vision of the good life out there in front of us .
Which is what Peter-Paul Verbeek , the Dutch philosopher of technology , says .
No matter whether we as designers intend it or not , we materialize morality .
We make certain things harder and easier to do .
We organize the existence of people .
We put a certain vision of what good or bad or normal or usual is in front of people by everything we put out there in the world .
Even something as innocuous as a set of school chairs is a persuasive technology .
Because it presents and materializes a certain vision of the good life -- the good life in which teaching and learning and listening is about one person teaching , the others listening , in which it is about , learning is done while sitting , in which you learn for yourself , in which you &apos;re not supposed to change these rules because the chairs are fixed to the ground .
And even something as innocuous as a single design chair -- like this one by Arne Jacobsen -- is a persuasive technology .
Because , again , it communicates an idea of the good life .
A good life -- a life that you say you as a designer consent to by saying , &quot; In the good life , goods are produced as sustainably or unsustainably as this chair .
Workers are treated as well or as badly as the workers were treated who built that chair . &quot;
The good life is a life where design is important because somebody obviously took the time and spent the money for that kind of well-designed chair , where tradition is important because this is a traditional classic and someone cared about this , and where there is something as conspicuous consumption , where it is okay and normal to spend a humungous amount of money on such a chair to signal to other people what your social status is .
So these are the kinds of layers , the kinds of questions I wanted to lead you through today -- the question of , What are the intentions that you bring to bear when you &apos;re designing something ?
What are the effects , intended and unintended , that you &apos;re having ?
What are the values you &apos;re using to judge those ?
What are the virtues , the aspirations that you &apos;re actually expressing in that ?
And how does that apply , not just to persuasive technology , but to everything you design ?
Do we stop there ?
I don &apos;t think so .
I think that all of these things are eventually informed by the core of all of this -- and this is nothing but life itself .
Why , when the question of what the good life is informs everything that we design , should we stop at design and not ask ourselves , how does it apply to our own life ?
&quot; Why should the lamp or the house be an art object , but not our life ? &quot;
as Michel Foucault puts it .
Just to give you a practical example of Buster Benson .
This is Buster setting up a pull-up machine at the office of his new startup Habit Labs , where they &apos;re trying to build up other applications like Health Month for people .
And why is he building a thing like this ?
Well here is the set of axioms that Habit Labs , Buster &apos;s startup , put up for themselves on how they wanted to work together as a team when they &apos;re building these applications -- a set of moral principles they set themselves for working together -- and one of them being , &quot; We take care of our own health and manage our own burnout . &quot;
Because ultimately how can you ask yourselves and how can you find an answer on what vision of the good life you want to convey and create with your designs without asking the question , what vision of the good life do you yourself want to live ?
And with that , I thank you .

&lt; url &gt; http : / / www.ted.com / talks / peter _ norvig _ the _ 100 _ 000 _ student _ classroom.html &lt; / url &gt;
Everyone is both a learner and a teacher .
This is me being inspired by my first tutor , my mom , and this is me teaching Introduction to Artificial Intelligence to 200 students at Stanford University .
Now the students and I enjoyed the class , but it occurred to me that while the subject matter and modern , the teaching technology isn &apos;t .
In fact , I use basically the same technology as this 14th-century classroom .
Note the textbook , the sage on the stage , and the sleeping guy in the back .
Just like today .
So my co-teacher , Sebastian Thrun , and I thought , there must be a better way .
We challenged ourselves to create an online class that would be equal or better in quality to our Stanford class , but to bring it to anyone in the world for free .
We announced the class on July 29th , and within two weeks , 50,000 people had signed up for it .
And that grew to 160,000 students from 209 countries .
We were thrilled to have that kind of audience , and just a bit terrified that we hadn &apos;t finished preparing the class yet .
So we got to work .
We studied what others had done , what we could copy and what we could change .
Benjamin Bloom had showed that one-on-one tutoring works best , so that &apos;s what we tried to emulate , like with me and my mom , even though we knew it would be one-on-thousands .
Here , an overhead video camera is recording me as I &apos;m talking and drawing on a piece of paper .
A student said , &quot; This class felt like sitting in a bar with a really smart friend who &apos;s explaining something you haven &apos;t grasped , but are about to . &quot;
And that &apos;s exactly what we were aiming for .
Now , from Khan Academy , we saw that short 10-minute videos worked much better than trying to record an hour-long lecture and put it on the small-format screen .
We decided to go even shorter and more interactive .
Our typical video is two minutes , sometimes shorter , never more than six , and then we pause for a quiz question , to make it feel like one-on-one tutoring .
Here , I &apos;m explaining how a computer uses the grammar of English to parse sentences , and here , there &apos;s a pause and the student has to reflect , understand what &apos;s going on and check the right boxes before they can continue .
Students learn best when they &apos;re actively practicing .
We wanted to engage them , to have them grapple with ambiguity and guide them to synthesize the key ideas themselves .
We mostly avoid questions like , &quot; Here &apos;s a formula , now tell me the value of Y when X is equal to two . &quot;
We preferred open-ended questions .
One student wrote , &quot; Now I &apos;m seeing Bayes networks and examples of game theory everywhere I look . &quot;
And I like that kind of response .
That &apos;s just what we were going for .
We didn &apos;t want students to memorize the formulas ; we wanted to change the way they looked at the world .
And we succeeded .
Or , I should say , the students succeeded .
And it &apos;s a little bit ironic that we set about to disrupt traditional education , and in doing so , we ended up making our online class much more like a traditional college class than other online classes .
Most online classes , the videos are always available .
You can watch them any time you want .
But if you can do it any time , that means you can do it tomorrow , and if you can do it tomorrow , well , you may not ever get around to it .
So we brought back the innovation of having due dates .
You could watch the videos any time you wanted during the week , but at the end of the week , you had to get the homework done .
This motivated the students to keep going , and it also meant that everybody was working on the same thing at the same time , so if you went into a discussion forum , you could get an answer from a peer within minutes .
Now , I &apos;ll show you some of the forums , most of which were self-organized by the students themselves .
From Daphne Koller and Andrew Ng , we learned the concept of &quot; flipping &quot; the classroom .
Students watched the videos on their own , and then they come together to discuss them .
From Eric Mazur , I learned about peer instruction , that peers can be the best teachers , because they &apos;re the ones that remember what it &apos;s like to not understand .
Sebastian and I have forgotten some of that .
Of course , we couldn &apos;t have a classroom discussion with tens of thousands of students , so we encouraged and nurtured these online forums .
And finally , from Teach For America , I learned that a class is not primarily about information .
More important is motivation and determination .
It was crucial that the students see that we &apos;re working hard for them and they &apos;re all supporting each other .
Now , the class ran 10 weeks , and in the end , about half of the 160,000 students watched at least one video each week , and over 20,000 finished all the homework , putting in 50 to 100 hours .
They got this statement of accomplishment .
So what have we learned ?
Well , we tried some old ideas and some new and put them together , but there are more ideas to try .
Sebastian &apos;s teaching another class now .
I &apos;ll do one in the fall .
Stanford Coursera , Udacity , MITx and others have more classes coming .
It &apos;s a really exciting time .
But to me , the most exciting part of it is the data that we &apos;re gathering .
We &apos;re gathering thousands of interactions per student per class , billions of interactions altogether , and now we can start analyzing that , and when we learn from that , do experimentations , that &apos;s when the real revolution will come .
And you &apos;ll be able to see the results from a new generation of amazing students .

I had a fire nine days ago .
My archive : 175 films , my 16-millimeter negative , all my books , my dad &apos;s books , my photographs .
I &apos;d collected -- I was a collector , major , big-time .
It &apos;s gone .
I just looked at it , and I didn &apos;t know what to do .
I mean , this was -- was I my things ?
I always live in the present -- I love the present .
I cherish the future .
And I was taught some strange thing as a kid , like , you &apos;ve got to make something good out of something bad .
You &apos;ve got to make something good out of something bad .
This was bad ! Man , I was -- I cough . I was sick .
That &apos;s my camera lens . The first one -- the one I shot my Bob Dylan film with 35 years ago .
That &apos;s my feature film . &quot; King , Murray &quot; won Cannes Film Festival 1970 -- the only print I had .
That &apos;s my papers .
That was in minutes -- 20 minutes .
Epiphany hit me . Something hit me .
&quot; You &apos;ve got to make something good out of something bad , &quot; I started to say to my friends , neighbors , my sister .
By the way , that &apos;s &quot; Sputnik . &quot; I ran it last year .
&quot; Sputnik &quot; was downtown , the negative . It wasn &apos;t touched .
These are some pieces of things I used in my Sputnik feature film , which opens in New York in two weeks downtown .
I called my sister . I called my neighbors . I said , &quot; Come dig . &quot;
That &apos;s me at my desk .
That was a desk took 40-some years to build .
You know -- all the stuff .
That &apos;s my daughter , Jean .
She came . She &apos;s a nurse in San Francisco .
&quot; Dig it up , &quot; I said . &quot; Pieces .
I want pieces . Bits and pieces . &quot;
I came up with this idea : a life of bits and pieces , which I &apos;m just starting to work on -- my next project .
That &apos;s my sister . She took care of pictures , because I was a big collector of snapshot photography that I believed said a lot .
And those are some of the pictures that -- something was good about the burnt pictures .
I didn &apos;t know . I looked at that -- I said , &quot; Wow , is that better than the -- &quot; That &apos;s my proposal on Jimmy Doolittle . I made that movie for television .
It &apos;s the only copy I had . Pieces of it .
Idea about women .
So I started to say , &quot; Hey , man , you are too much !
You could cry about this . &quot; I really didn &apos;t .
I just instead said , &quot; I &apos;m going to make something out of it , and maybe next year ... &quot; And I appreciate this moment to come up on this stage with so many people who &apos;ve already given me so much solace , and just say to TEDsters : I &apos;m proud of me . That I take something bad , I turn it , and I &apos;m going to make something good out of this , all these pieces .
That &apos;s Arthur Leipzig &apos;s original photograph I loved .
I was a big record collector -- the records didn &apos;t make it . Boy , I tell you , film burns . Film burns .
I mean , this was 16-millimeter safety film .
The negatives are gone .
That &apos;s my father &apos;s letter to me , telling me to marry the woman I first married when I was 20 .
That &apos;s my daughter and me .
She &apos;s still there . She &apos;s there this morning , actually .
That &apos;s my house .
My family &apos;s living in the Hilton Hotel in Scotts Valley .
That &apos;s my wife , Heidi , who didn &apos;t take it as well as I did .
My children , Davey and Henry .
My son , Davey , in the hotel two nights ago .
So , my message to you folks , from my three minutes , is that I appreciate the chance to share this with you . I will be back . I love being at TED .
I came to live it , and I am living it .
That &apos;s my view from my window outside of Santa Cruz , in Bonny Doon , just 35 miles from here .
Thank you everybody .

&lt; title &gt; David Hoffman : What happens when you lose everything &lt; / title &gt;
&lt; description &gt; Nine days before TED2008 , filmmaker David Hoffman lost almost everything he owned in a fire that destroyed his home , office and 30 years of passionate collecting .

I was here four years ago , and I remember , at the time , that the talks weren &apos;t put online .
I think they were given to TEDsters in a box , a box set of DVDs , which they put on their shelves , where they are now .
And actually , Chris called me a week after I &apos;d given my talk and he said , &quot; We &apos;re going to start putting them online .
Can we put yours online ? &quot; And I said , &quot; Sure . &quot;
And four years later , as I said , it &apos;s been seen by four ...
Well , it &apos;s been downloaded four million times .
So I suppose you could multiply that by 20 or something to get the number of people who &apos;ve seen it .
And , as Chris says , there is a hunger for videos of me .
... don &apos;t you feel ?
So , this whole event has been an elaborate build-up to me doing another one for you , so here it is .
Al Gore spoke at the TED conference I spoke at four years ago and talked about the climate crisis .
And I referenced that at the end of my last talk .
So I want to pick up from there because I only had 18 minutes , frankly .
So , as I was saying ...
You see , he &apos;s right .
I mean , there is a major climate crisis , obviously , and I think if people don &apos;t believe it , they should get out more .
But I believe there &apos;s a second climate crisis , which is as severe , which has the same origins , and that we have to deal with with the same urgency .
And I mean by this -- and you may say , by the way , &quot; Look , I &apos;m good .
I have one climate crisis ; I don &apos;t really need the second one . &quot;
But this is a crisis of , not natural resources -- though I believe that &apos;s true -- but a crisis of human resources .
I believe fundamentally , as many speakers have said during the past few days , that we make very poor use of our talents .
Very many people go through their whole lives having no real sense of what their talents may be , or if they have any to speak of .
I meet all kinds of people who don &apos;t think they &apos;re really good at anything .
Actually , I kind of divide the world into two groups now .
Jeremy Bentham , the great utilitarian philosopher , once spiked this argument .
He said , &quot; There are two types of people in this world : those who divide the world into two types and those who do not . &quot;
Well , I do .
I meet all kinds of people who don &apos;t enjoy what they do .
They simply go through their lives getting on with it .
They get no great pleasure from what they do .
They endure it rather than enjoy it and wait for the weekend .
But I also meet people who love what they do and couldn &apos;t imagine doing anything else .
If you said to them , &quot; Don &apos;t do this anymore , &quot; they &apos;d wonder what you were talking about .
Because it isn &apos;t what they do , it &apos;s who they are . They say , &quot; But this is me , you know .
It would be foolish for me to abandon this , because it speaks to my most authentic self . &quot;
And it &apos;s not true of enough people .
In fact , on the contrary , I think it &apos;s still true of a minority of people .
I think there are many possible explanations for it .
And high among them is education , because education , in a way , dislocates very many people from their natural talents .
And human resources are like natural resources ; they &apos;re often buried deep .
You have to go looking for them , they &apos;re not just lying around on the surface .
You have to create the circumstances where they show themselves .
And you might imagine education would be the way that happens , but too often it &apos;s not .
Every education system in the world is being reformed at the moment and it &apos;s not enough .
Reform is no use anymore , because that &apos;s simply improving a broken model .
What we need -- and the word &apos;s been used many times during the course of the past few days -- is not evolution , but a revolution in education .
This has to be transformed into something else .
One of the real challenges is to innovate fundamentally in education .
Innovation is hard because it means doing something that people don &apos;t find very easy , for the most part .
It means challenging what we take for granted , things that we think are obvious .
The great problem for reform or transformation is the tyranny of common sense ; things that people think , &quot; Well , it can &apos;t be done any other way because that &apos;s the way it &apos;s done . &quot;
I came across a great quote recently from Abraham Lincoln , who I thought you &apos;d be pleased to have quoted at this point .
He said this in December 1862 to the second annual meeting of Congress .
I ought to explain that I have no idea what was happening at the time .
We don &apos;t teach American history in Britain .
We suppress it . You know , this is our policy .
So , no doubt , something fascinating was happening in December 1862 , which the Americans among us will be aware of .
But he said this : &quot; The dogmas of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present .
The occasion is piled high with difficulty , and we must rise with the occasion . &quot;
I love that .
Not rise to it , rise with it .
&quot; As our case is new , so we must think anew and act anew .
We must disenthrall ourselves , and then we shall save our country . &quot;
I love that word , &quot; disenthrall . &quot;
You know what it means ?
That there are ideas that all of us are enthralled to , which we simply take for granted as the natural order of things , the way things are .
And many of our ideas have been formed , not to meet the circumstances of this century , but to cope with the circumstances of previous centuries .
But our minds are still hypnotized by them , and we have to disenthrall ourselves of some of them .
Now , doing this is easier said than done .
It &apos;s very hard to know , by the way , what it is you take for granted .
And the reason is that you take it for granted .
So let me ask you something you may take for granted .
How many of you here are over the age of 25 ?
That &apos;s not what I think you take for granted , I &apos;m sure you &apos;re familiar with that already .
Are there any people here under the age of 25 ?
Great . Now , those over 25 , could you put your hands up if you &apos;re wearing your wristwatch ?
Now that &apos;s a great deal of us , isn &apos;t it ?
Ask a room full of teenagers the same thing .
Teenagers do not wear wristwatches .
I don &apos;t mean they can &apos;t or they &apos;re not allowed to , they just often choose not to .
And the reason is , you see , that we were brought up in a pre-digital culture , those of us over 25 .
And so for us , if you want to know the time you have to wear something to tell it .
Kids now live in a world which is digitized , and the time , for them , is everywhere .
They see no reason to do this .
And by the way , you don &apos;t need to do it either ; it &apos;s just that you &apos;ve always done it and you carry on doing it .
My daughter never wears a watch , my daughter Kate , who &apos;s 20 .
She doesn &apos;t see the point .
As she says , &quot; It &apos;s a single function device . &quot;
&quot; Like , how lame is that ? &quot;
And I say , &quot; No , no , it tells the date as well . &quot;
&quot; It has multiple functions . &quot;
But , you see , there are things we &apos;re enthralled to in education .
Let me give you a couple of examples .
One of them is the idea of linearity : that it starts here and you go through a track and if you do everything right , you will end up set for the rest of your life .
Everybody who &apos;s spoken at TED has told us implicitly , or sometimes explicitly , a different story : that life is not linear ; it &apos;s organic .
We create our lives symbiotically as we explore our talents in relation to the circumstances they help to create for us .
But , you know , we have become obsessed with this linear narrative .
And probably the pinnacle for education is getting you to college .
I think we are obsessed with getting people to college .
Certain sorts of college .
I don &apos;t mean you shouldn &apos;t go to college , but not everybody needs to go and not everybody needs to go now .
Maybe they go later , not right away .
And I was up in San Francisco a while ago doing a book signing .
There was this guy buying a book , he was in his 30s .
And I said , &quot; What do you do ? &quot;
And he said , &quot; I &apos;m a fireman . &quot;
And I said , &quot; How long have you been a fireman ? &quot;
He said , &quot; Always . I &apos;ve always been a fireman . &quot;
And I said , &quot; Well , when did you decide ? &quot;
He said , &quot; As a kid . &quot; He said , &quot; Actually , it was a problem for me at school , because at school , everybody wanted to be a fireman . &quot;
He said , &quot; But I wanted to be a fireman . &quot;
And he said , &quot; When I got to the senior year of school , my teachers didn &apos;t take it seriously .
This one teacher didn &apos;t take it seriously .
He said I was throwing my life away if that &apos;s all I chose to do with it ; that I should go to college , I should become a professional person , that I had great potential and I was wasting my talent to do that . &quot;
And he said , &quot; It was humiliating because he said it in front of the whole class and I really felt dreadful .
But it &apos;s what I wanted , and as soon as I left school , I applied to the fire service and I was accepted . &quot;
And he said , &quot; You know , I was thinking about that guy recently , just a few minutes ago when you were speaking , about this teacher , &quot; he said , &quot; because six months ago , I saved his life . &quot;
He said , &quot; He was in a car wreck , and I pulled him out , gave him CPR , and I saved his wife &apos;s life as well . &quot;
He said , &quot; I think he thinks better of me now . &quot;
You know , to me , human communities depend upon a diversity of talent , not a singular conception of ability .
And at the heart of our challenges -- At the heart of the challenge is to reconstitute our sense of ability and of intelligence .
This linearity thing is a problem .
When I arrived in L.A.
about nine years ago , I came across a policy statement -- very well-intentioned -- which said , &quot; College begins in kindergarten . &quot;
No , it doesn &apos;t .
It doesn &apos;t .
If we had time , I could go into this , but we don &apos;t .
Kindergarten begins in kindergarten .
A friend of mine once said , &quot; You know , a three year-old is not half a six year-old . &quot;
They &apos;re three .
But as we just heard in this last session , there &apos;s such competition now to get into kindergarten -- to get to the right kindergarten -- that people are being interviewed for it at three .
Kids sitting in front of unimpressed panels , you know , with their resumes , flipping through and saying , &quot; Well , this is it ? &quot;
&quot; You &apos;ve been around for 36 months , and this is it ? &quot;
&quot; You &apos;ve achieved nothing -- commit .
Spent the first six months breastfeeding , the way I can see it . &quot;
See , it &apos;s outrageous as a conception , but it &#91; unclear &#93; .
The other big issue is conformity .
We have built our education systems on the model of fast food .
This is something Jamie Oliver talked about the other day .
You know there are two models of quality assurance in catering .
One is fast food , where everything is standardized .
The other are things like Zagat and Michelin restaurants , where everything is not standardized , they &apos;re customized to local circumstances .
And we have sold ourselves into a fast food model of education , and it &apos;s impoverishing our spirit and our energies as much as fast food is depleting our physical bodies .
I think we have to recognize a couple of things here .
One is that human talent is tremendously diverse .
People have very different aptitudes .
I worked out recently that I was given a guitar as a kid at about the same time that Eric Clapton got his first guitar .
You know , it worked out for Eric , that &apos;s all I &apos;m saying .
In a way , it did not for me .
I could not get this thing to work no matter how often or how hard I blew into it .
It just wouldn &apos;t work .
But it &apos;s not only about that .
It &apos;s about passion .
Often , people are good at things they don &apos;t really care for .
It &apos;s about passion , and what excites our spirit and our energy .
And if you &apos;re doing the thing that you love to do , that you &apos;re good at , time takes a different course entirely .
My wife &apos;s just finished writing a novel , and I think it &apos;s a great book , but she disappears for hours on end .
You know this , if you &apos;re doing something you love , an hour feels like five minutes .
If you &apos;re doing something that doesn &apos;t resonate with your spirit , five minutes feels like an hour .
And the reason so many people are opting out of education is because it doesn &apos;t feed their spirit , it doesn &apos;t feed their energy or their passion .
So I think we have to change metaphors .
We have to go from what is essentially an industrial model of education , a manufacturing model , which is based on linearity and conformity and batching people .
We have to move to a model that is based more on principles of agriculture .
We have to recognize that human flourishing is not a mechanical process ; it &apos;s an organic process .
And you cannot predict the outcome of human development .
All you can do , like a farmer , is create the conditions under which they will begin to flourish .
So when we look at reforming education and transforming it , it isn &apos;t like cloning a system .
There are great ones , like KIPP &apos;s ; it &apos;s a great system .
There are many great models .
It &apos;s about customizing to your circumstances and personalizing education to the people you &apos;re actually teaching .
And doing that , I think , is the answer to the future because it &apos;s not about scaling a new solution ; it &apos;s about creating a movement in education in which people develop their own solutions , but with external support based on a personalized curriculum .
Now in this room , there are people who represent extraordinary resources in business , in multimedia , in the Internet .
These technologies , combined with the extraordinary talents of teachers , provide an opportunity to revolutionize education .
And I urge you to get involved in it because it &apos;s vital , not just to ourselves , but to the future of our children .
But we have to change from the industrial model to an agricultural model , where each school can be flourishing tomorrow .
That &apos;s where children experience life .
Or at home , if that &apos;s where they choose to be educated with their families or their friends .
There &apos;s been a lot of talk about dreams over the course of this few days .
And I wanted to just very quickly ...
I was very struck by Natalie Merchant &apos;s songs last night , recovering old poems .
I wanted to read you a quick , very short poem from W. B. Yeats , who some of you may know .
He wrote this to his love , Maud Gonne , and he was bewailing the fact that he couldn &apos;t really give her what he thought she wanted from him .
And he says , &quot; I &apos;ve got something else , but it may not be for you . &quot;
He says this : &quot; Had I the heavens &apos; embroidered cloths , Enwrought with gold and silver light , The blue and the dim and the dark cloths Of night and light and the half-light , I would spread the cloths under your feet : But I , being poor , have only my dreams ; I have spread my dreams under your feet ; Tread softly because you tread on my dreams . &quot;
And every day , everywhere , our children spread their dreams beneath our feet .
And we should tread softly .
Thank you .
Thank you very much .

&lt; title &gt; Sir Ken Robinson : Bring on the learning revolution ! &lt; / title &gt;

&lt; url &gt; http : / / www.ted.com / talks / rufus _ griscom _ alisa _ volkman _ let _ s _ talk _ parenting _ taboos.html &lt; / url &gt;
Alisa Volkman : So this is where our story begins -- the dramatic moments of the birth of our first son , Declan .
Obviously a really profound moment , and it changed our lives in many ways .
It also changed our lives in many unexpected ways , and those unexpected ways we later reflected on , that eventually spawned a business idea between the two of us , and a year later , we launched Babble , a website for parents .
Rufus Griscom : Now I think of our story as starting a few years earlier . AV : That &apos;s true .
RG : You may remember , we fell head over heels in love .
AV : We did .
RG : We were at the time running a very different kind of website .
It was a website called Nerve.com , the tagline of which was &quot; literate smut . &quot;
It was in theory , and hopefully in practice , a smart online magazine about sex and culture .
AV : That spawned a dating site .
But you can understand the jokes that we get . Sex begets babies .
You follow instructions on Nerve and you should end up on Babble , which we did .
And we might launch a geriatric site as our third . We &apos;ll see .
RG : But for us , the continuity between Nerve and Babble was not just the life stage thing , which is , of course , relevant , but it was really more about our desire to speak very honestly about subjects that people have difficulty speaking honestly about .
It seems to us that when people start dissembling , people start lying about things , that &apos;s when it gets really interesting .
That &apos;s a subject that we want to dive into .
And we &apos;ve been surprised to find , as young parents , that there are almost more taboos around parenting than there are around sex .
AV : It &apos;s true . So like we said , the early years were really wonderful , but they were also really difficult .
And we feel like some of that difficulty was because of this false advertisement around parenting .
We subscribed to a lot of magazines , did our homework , but really everywhere you look around , we were surrounded by images like this .
And we went into parenting expecting our lives to look like this .
The sun was always streaming in , and our children would never be crying .
I would always be perfectly coiffed and well rested , and in fact , it was not like that at all .
RG : When we lowered the glossy parenting magazine that we were looking at , with these beautiful images , and looked at the scene in our actual living room , it looked a little bit more like this .
These are our three sons .
And of course , they &apos;re not always crying and screaming , but with three boys , there &apos;s a decent probability that at least one of them will not be comporting himself exactly as he should .
AV : Yes , you can see where the disconnect was happening for us .
We really felt like what we went in expecting had nothing to do with what we were actually experiencing , and so we decided we really wanted to give it to parents straight .
We really wanted to let them understand what the realities of parenting were in an honest way .
RG : So today , what we would love to do is share with you four parenting taboos .
And of course , there are many more than four things you can &apos;t say about parenting , but we would like to share with you today four that are particularly relevant for us personally .
So the first , taboo number one : you can &apos;t say you didn &apos;t fall in love with your baby in the very first minute .
I remember vividly , sitting there in the hospital .
We were in the process of giving birth to our first child .
AV : We , or I ?
RG : I &apos;m sorry .
Misuse of the pronoun .
Alisa was very generously in the process of giving birth to our first child -- -- and I was there with a catcher &apos;s mitt .
And I was there with my arms open .
The nurse was coming at me with this beautiful , beautiful child , and I remember , as she was approaching me , the voices of friends saying , &quot; The moment they put the baby in your hands , you will feel a sense of love that will come over you that is &#91; on &#93; an order of magnitude more powerful than anything you &apos;ve ever experienced in your entire life . &quot;
So I was bracing myself for the moment .
The baby was coming , and I was ready for this Mack truck of love to just knock me off my feet .
And instead , when the baby was placed in my hands , it was an extraordinary moment .
This picture is from literally a few seconds after the baby was placed in my hands and I brought him over .
And you can see , our eyes were glistening .
I was overwhelmed with love and affection for my wife , with deep , deep gratitude that we had what appeared to be a healthy child .
And it was also , of course , surreal .
I mean , I had to check the tags and make sure .
I was incredulous , &quot; Are you sure this is our child ? &quot;
And this was all quite remarkable .
But what I felt towards the child at that moment was deep affection , but nothing like what I feel for him now , five years later .
And so we &apos;ve done something here that is heretical .
We have charted our love for our child over time .
This , as you know , is an act of heresy .
You &apos;re not allowed to chart love .
The reason you &apos;re not allowed to chart love is because we think of love as a binary thing .
You &apos;re either in love , or you &apos;re not in love .
You love , or you don &apos;t love .
And I think the reality is that love is a process , and I think the problem with thinking of love as something that &apos;s binary is that it causes us to be unduly concerned that love is fraudulent , or inadequate , or what have you .
And I think I &apos;m speaking obviously here to the father &apos;s experience .
But I think a lot of men do go through this sense in the early months , maybe their first year , that their emotional response is inadequate in some fashion .
AV : Well , I &apos;m glad Rufus is bringing this up , because you can notice where he dips in the first years where I think I was doing most of the work .
But we like to joke , in the first few months of all of our children &apos;s lives , this is Uncle Rufus .
RG : I &apos;m a very affectionate uncle , very affectionate uncle .
AV : Yes , and I often joke with Rufus when he comes home that I &apos;m not sure he would actually be able to find our child in a line-up amongst other babies .
So I actually threw a pop quiz here onto Rufus .
RG : Uh oh .
AV : I don &apos;t want to embarrass him too much . But I am going to give him three seconds .
RG : That is not fair . This is a trick question . He &apos;s not up there , is he ?
AV : Our eight-week-old son is somewhere in here , and I want to see if Rufus can actually quickly identify him .
RG : The far left . AV : No !
RG : Cruel .
AV : Nothing more to be said .
I &apos;ll move on to taboo number two .
You can &apos;t talk about how lonely having a baby can be .
I enjoyed being pregnant . I loved it .
I felt incredibly connected to the community around me .
I felt like everyone was participating in my pregnancy , all around me , tracking it down till the actual due-date .
I felt like I was a vessel of the future of humanity .
That continued into the the hospital . It was really exhilarating .
I was shower with gifts and flowers and visitors .
It was a really wonderful experience , but when I got home , I suddenly felt very disconnected and suddenly shut in and shut out , and I was really surprised by those feelings .
I did expect it to be difficult , have sleepless nights , constant feedings , but I did not expect the feelings of isolation and loneliness that I experienced , and I was really surprised that no one had talked to me , that I was going to be feeling this way .
And I called my sister whom I &apos;m very close to -- and had three children -- and I asked her , &quot; Why didn &apos;t you tell me I was going to be feeling this way , that I was going to have these -- feeling incredibly isolated ? &quot;
And she said -- I &apos;ll never forget -- &quot; It &apos;s just not something you want to say to a mother that &apos;s having a baby for the first time . &quot;
RG : And of course , we think it &apos;s precisely what you really should be saying to mothers who have kids for the first time .
And that this , of course , one of the themes for us is that we think that candor and brutal honesty is critical to us collectively being great parents .
And it &apos;s hard not to think that part of what leads to this sense of isolation is our modern world .
So Alisa &apos;s experience is not isolated .
So your 58 percent of mothers surveyed report feelings of loneliness .
Of those , 67 percent are most lonely when their kids are zero to five -- probably really zero to two .
In the process of preparing this , we looked at how some other cultures around the world deal with this period of time , because here in the Western world , less than 50 percent of us live near our family members , which I think is part of why this is such a tough period .
So to take one example among many : in Southern India there &apos;s a practice known as jholabhari , in which the pregnant woman , when she &apos;s seven or eight months pregnant , moves in with her mother and goes through a series of rituals and ceremonies , give birth and returns home to her nuclear family several months after the child is born .
And this is one of many ways that we think other cultures offset this kind of lonely period .
AV : So taboo number three : you can &apos;t talk about your miscarriage -- but today I &apos;ll talk about mine .
So after we had Declan , we kind of recalibrated our expectations .
We thought we actually could go through this again and thought we knew what we would be up against .
And we were grateful that I was able to get pregnant , and I soon learned that we were having a boy , and then when I was five months , we learned that we had lost our child .
This is actually the last little image we have of him .
And it was obviously a very difficult time -- really painful .
As I was working through that mourning process , I was amazed that I didn &apos;t want to see anybody .
I really wanted to crawl into a hole , and I didn &apos;t really know how I was going to work my way back into my surrounding community .
And I realize , I think , the way I was feeling that way , is on a really deep gut level , I was feeling a lot of shame and embarrassed , frankly , that , in some respects , I had failed at delivering what I &apos;m genetically engineered to do .
And of course , it made me question , if I wasn &apos;t able to have another child , what would that mean for my marriage , and just me as a woman .
So it was a very difficult time .
As I started working through it more , I started climbing out of that hole and talking with other people .
I was really amazed by all the stories that started flooding in .
People I interacted with daily , worked with , was friends with , family members that I had known a long time , had never shared with me their own stories .
And I just remember feeling all these stories came out of the woodwork , and I felt like I happened upon this secret society of women that I now was a part of , which was reassuring and also really concerning .
And I think , miscarriage is an invisible loss .
There &apos;s not really a lot of community support around it .
There &apos;s really no ceremony , rituals , or rites .
And I think , with a death , you have a funeral , you celebrate the life , and there &apos;s a lot of community support , and it &apos;s something women don &apos;t have with miscarriage .
RG : Which is too bad because , of course , it &apos;s a very common and very traumatic experience .
Fifteen to 20 percent of all pregnancies result in miscarriage , and I find this astounding .
In a survey , 74 percent of women said that miscarriage , they felt , was partly their fault , which is awful .
And astoundingly , 22 percent said they would hide a miscarriage from their spouse .
So taboo number four : you can &apos;t say that your average happiness has declined since having a child .
The party line is that every single aspect of my life has just gotten dramatically better ever since I participated in the miracle that is childbirth and family .
I &apos;ll never forget , I remember vividly to this day , our first son , Declan , was nine months old , and I was sitting there on the couch , and I was reading Daniel Gilbert &apos;s wonderful book , &quot; Stumbling on Happiness . &quot;
And I got about two-thirds of the way through , and there was a chart on the right-hand side -- on the right-hand page -- that we &apos;ve labeled here &quot; The Most Terrifying Chart Imaginable for a New Parent . &quot;
This chart is comprised of four completely independent studies .
Basically , there &apos;s this precipitous drop of marital satisfaction , which is closely aligned , we all know , with broader happiness , that doesn &apos;t rise again until your first child goes to college .
So I &apos;m sitting here looking at the next two decades of my life , this chasm of happiness that we &apos;re driving our proverbial convertible straight into .
We were despondent .
AV : So you can imagine , I mean again , the first few months were difficult , but we &apos;d come out of it , and were really shocked to see this study .
So we really wanted to take a deeper look at it in hopes that we would find a silver lining .
RG : And that &apos;s when it &apos;s great to be running a website for parents , because we got this incredible reporter to go and interview all the scientists who conducted these four studies .
We said , something is wrong here .
There &apos;s something missing from these studies .
It can &apos;t possibly be that bad .
So Liz Mitchell did a wonderful job with this piece , and she interviewed four scientists , and she also interviewed Daniel Gilbert , and we did indeed find a silver lining .
So this is our guess as to what this baseline of average happiness arguably looks like throughout life .
Average happiness is , of course , inadequate , because it doesn &apos;t speak to the moment-by-moment experience , and so this is what we think it looks like when you layer in moment-to-moment experience .
And so we all remember as children , the tiniest little thing -- and we see it on the faces of our children -- the teeniest little thing can just rocket them to these heights of just utter adulation , and then the next teeniest little thing can cause them just to plummet to the depths of despair .
And it &apos;s just extraordinary to watch , and we remember it ourselves .
And then , of course , as you get older , it &apos;s almost like age is a form of lithium .
As you get older , you become more stable .
And part of what happens , I think , in your &apos; 20s and &apos; 30s , is you start to learn to hedge your happiness .
You start to realize that &quot; Hey , I could go to this live music event and have an utterly transforming experience that will cover my entire body with goosebumps , but it &apos;s more likely that I &apos;ll feel claustrophobic and I won &apos;t be able to get a beer .
So I &apos;m not going to go .
I &apos;ve got a good stereo at home . So , I &apos;m not going to go . &quot;
So your average happiness goes up , but you lose those transcendent moments .
AV : Yeah , and then you have your first child , and then you really resubmit yourself to these highs and lows -- the highs being the first steps , the first smile , your child reading to you for the first time -- the lows being , our house , any time from six to seven every night .
But you realize you resubmit yourself to losing control in a really wonderful way , which we think provides a lot of meaning to our lives and is quite gratifying .
RG : And so in effect , we trade average happiness .
We trade the sort of security and safety of a certain level of contentment for these transcendent moments .
So where does that leave the two of us as a family with our three little boys in the thick of all this ?
There &apos;s another factor in our case .
We have violated yet another taboo in our own lives , and this is a bonus taboo .
AV : A quick bonus taboo for you , that we should not be working together , especially with three children -- and we are .
RG : And we had reservations about this on the front end .
Everybody knows , you should absolutely not work with your spouse .
In fact , when we first went out to raise money to start Babble , the venture capitalists said , &quot; We categorically don &apos;t invest in companies founded by husbands and wives , because there &apos;s an extra point of failure .
It &apos;s a bad idea . Don &apos;t do it . &quot;
And we obviously went forward . We did .
We raised the money , and we &apos;re thrilled that we did , because in this phase of one &apos;s life , the incredibly scarce resource is time .
And if you &apos;re really passionate about what you do every day -- which we are -- and you &apos;re also passionate about your relationship , this is the only way we know how to do it .
And so the final question that we would ask is : can we collectively bend that happiness chart upwards ?
It &apos;s great that we have these transcendent moments of joy , but they &apos;re sometimes pretty quick .
And so how about that average baseline of happiness ?
Can we move that up a little bit ?
AV : And we kind of feel that the happiness gap , which we talked about , is really the result of walking into parenting -- and really any long-term partnership for that matter -- with the wrong expectations .
And if you have the right expectations and expectation management , we feel like it &apos;s going to be a pretty gratifying experience .
RG : And so this is what -- And we think that a lot of parents , when you get in there -- in our case anyway -- you pack your bags for a trip to Europe , and you &apos;re really excited to go .
Get out of the airplane , it turns out you &apos;re trekking in Nepal .
And trekking in Nepal is an extraordinary experience , particularly if you pack your bags properly and you know what you &apos;re getting in for and you &apos;re psyched .
So the point of all this for us today is not just hopefully honesty for the sake of honesty , but a hope that by being more honest and candid about these experiences , that we can all collectively bend that happiness baseline up a little bit .
RG + AV : Thank you .

So as a fashion designer , I &apos;ve always tended to think of materials something like this , or this , or maybe this .
But then I met a biologist , and now I think of materials like this -- green tea , sugar , a few microbes and a little time .
I &apos;m essentially using a kombucha recipe , which is a symbiotic mix of bacteria , yeasts and other micro-organisms , which spin cellulose in a fermentation process .
Over time , these tiny threads form in the liquid into layers and produce a mat on the surface .
So we start by brewing the tea .
I brew up to about 30 liters of tea at a time , and then while it &apos;s still hot , add a couple of kilos of sugar .
We stir this in until it &apos;s completely dissolved and then pour it into a growth bath .
We need to check that the temperature has cooled to below 30 degrees C.
And then we &apos;re ready to add the living organism .
And along with that , some acetic acid .
And once you get this process going , you can actually recycle your previous fermented liquid .
We need to maintain an optimum temperature for the growth .
And I use a heat mat to sit the bath on and a thermostat to regulate it .
And actually , in hot weather , I can just grow it outside .
So this is my mini fabric farm .
After about three days , the bubbles will appear on the surface of the liquid .
So this is telling us that the fermentation is in full swing .
And the bacteria are feeding on the sugar nutrients in the liquid .
So they &apos;re spinning these tiny nano fibers of pure cellulose .
And they &apos;re sticking together , forming layers and giving us a sheet on the surface .
After about two to three weeks , we &apos;re looking at something which is about an inch in thickness .
So the bath on the left is after five days , and on the right , after 10 .
And this is a static culture .
You don &apos;t have to do anything to it ; you just literally watch it grow .
It doesn &apos;t need light .
And when it &apos;s ready to harvest , you take it out of the bath and you wash it in cold , soapy water .
At this point , it &apos;s really heavy .
It &apos;s over 90 percent water , so we need to let that evaporate .
So I spread it out onto a wooden sheet .
Again , you can do that outside and just let it dry in the air .
And as it &apos;s drying , it &apos;s compressing , so what you &apos;re left with , depending on the recipe , is something that &apos;s either like a really light-weight , transparent paper , or something which is much more like a flexible vegetable leather .
And then you can either cut that out and sew it conventionally , or you can use the wet material to form it around a three-dimensional shape .
And as it evaporates , it will knit itself together , forming seams .
So the color in this jacket is coming purely from green tea .
I guess it also looks a little bit like human skin , which intrigues me .
Since it &apos;s organic , I &apos;m really keen to try and minimize the addition of any chemicals .
I can make it change color without using dye by a process of iron oxidation .
Using fruit and vegetable staining , create organic patterning .
And using indigo , make it anti-microbial .
And in fact , cotton would take up to 18 dips in indigo to achieve a color this dark .
And because of the super-absorbency of this kind of cellulose , it just takes one , and a really short one at that .
What I can &apos;t yet do is make it water-resistant .
So if I was to walk outside in the rain wearing this dress today , I would immediately start to absorb huge amounts of water .
The dress would get really heavy , and eventually the seams would probably fall apart -- leaving me feeling rather naked .
Possibly a good performance piece , but definitely not ideal for everyday wear .
What I &apos;m looking for is a way to give the material the qualities that I need .
So what I want to do is say to a future bug , &quot; Spin me a thread .
Align it in this direction .
Make it hydrophobic .
And while you &apos;re at it , just form it around this 3D shape . &quot;
Bacterial cellulose is actually already being used for wound healing , and possibly in the future for biocompatible blood vessels , possibly even replacement bone tissue .
But with synthetic biology , we can actually imagine engineering this bacterium to produce something that gives us the quality , quantity and shape of material that we desire .
Obviously , as a designer , that &apos;s really exciting because then I start to think , wow , we could actually imagine growing consumable products .
What excites me about using microbes is their efficiency .
So we only grow what we need .
There &apos;s no waste .
And in fact , we could make it from a waste stream -- so for example , a waste sugar stream from a food processing plant .
Finally , at the end of use , we could biodegrade it naturally along with your vegetable peelings .
What I &apos;m not suggesting is that microbial cellulose is going to be a replacement for cotton , leather or other textile materials .
But I do think it could be quite a smart and sustainable addition to our increasingly precious natural resources .
Ultimately , maybe it won &apos;t even be fashion where we see these microbes have their impact .
We could , for example , imagine growing a lamp , a chair , a car or maybe even a house .
So I guess what my question to you is : in the future , what would you choose to grow ?
Thank you very much .
Suzanne , just a curiosity , what you &apos;re wearing is not random .
This is one of the jackets you grew ?
SL : Yes , it is .
It &apos;s probably -- part of the project &apos;s still in process because this one is actually biodegrading in front of your eyes .
It &apos;s absorbing my sweat , and it &apos;s feeding on it .
Okay , so we &apos;ll let you go and save it , and rescue it .

&lt; url &gt; http : / / www.ted.com / talks / leslie _ t _ chang _ the _ voices _ of _ china _ s _ workers.html &lt; / url &gt;
Hi . So I &apos;d like to talk a little bit about the people who make the things we use every day : our shoes , our handbags , our computers and cell phones .
Now , this is a conversation that often calls up a lot of guilt .
Imagine the teenage farm girl who makes less than a dollar an hour stitching your running shoes , or the young Chinese man who jumps off a rooftop after working overtime assembling your iPad .
We , the beneficiaries of globalization , seem to exploit these victims with every purchase we make , and the injustice feels embedded in the products themselves .
After all , what &apos;s wrong with a world in which a worker on an iPhone assembly line can &apos;t even afford to buy one ?
It &apos;s taken for granted that Chinese factories are oppressive , and that it &apos;s our desire for cheap goods that makes them so .
So , this simple narrative equating Western demand and Chinese suffering is appealing , especially at a time when many of us already feel guilty about our impact on the world , but it &apos;s also inaccurate and disrespectful .
We must be peculiarly self-obsessed to imagine that we have the power to drive tens of millions of people on the other side of the world to migrate and suffer in such terrible ways .
In fact , China makes goods for markets all over the world , including its own , thanks to a combination of factors : its low costs , its large and educated workforce , and a flexible manufacturing system that responds quickly to market demands .
By focusing so much on ourselves and our gadgets , we have rendered the individuals on the other end into invisibility , as tiny and interchangeable as the parts of a mobile phone .
Chinese workers are not forced into factories because of our insatiable desire for iPods .
They choose to leave their homes in order to earn money , to learn new skills , and to see the world .
In the ongoing debate about globalization , what &apos;s been missing is the voices of the workers themselves .
Here are a few .
Bao Yongxiu : &quot; My mother tells me to come home and get married , but if I marry now , before I have fully developed myself , I can only marry an ordinary worker , so I &apos;m not in a rush . &quot;
Chen Ying : &quot; When I went home for the new year , everyone said I had changed . They asked me , what did you do that you have changed so much ?
I told them that I studied and worked hard . If you tell them more , they won &apos;t understand anyway . &quot;
Wu Chunming : &quot; Even if I make a lot of money , it won &apos;t satisfy me .
Just to make money is not enough meaning in life . &quot;
Xiao Jin : &quot; Now , after I get off work , I study English , because in the future , our customers won &apos;t be only Chinese , so we must learn more languages . &quot;
All of these speakers , by the way , are young women , 18 or 19 years old .
So I spent two years getting to know assembly line workers like these in the south China factory city called Dongguan .
Certain subjects came up over and over : how much money they made , what kind of husband they hoped to marry , whether they should jump to another factory or stay where they were .
Other subjects came up almost never , including living conditions that to me looked close to prison life : 10 or 15 workers in one room , 50 people sharing a single bathroom , days and nights ruled by the factory clock .
Everyone they knew lived in similar circumstances , and it was still better than the dormitories and homes of rural China .
The workers rarely spoke about the products they made , and they often had great difficulty explaining what exactly they did .
When I asked Lu Qingmin , the young woman I got to know best , what exactly she did on the factory floor , she said something to me in Chinese that sounded like &quot; qiu xi . &quot;
Only much later did I realize that she had been saying &quot; QC , &quot; or quality control .
She couldn &apos;t even tell me what she did on the factory floor .
All she could do was parrot a garbled abbreviation in a language she didn &apos;t even understand .
Karl Marx saw this as the tragedy of capitalism , the alienation of the worker from the product of his labor .
Unlike , say , a traditional maker of shoes or cabinets , the worker in an industrial factory has no control , no pleasure , and no true satisfaction or understanding in her own work .
But like so many theories that Marx arrived at sitting in the reading room of the British Museum , he got this one wrong .
Just because a person spends her time making a piece of something does not mean that she becomes that , a piece of something .
What she does with the money she earns , what she learns in that place , and how it changes her , these are the things that matter .
What a factory makes is never the point , and the workers could not care less who buys their products .
Journalistic coverage of Chinese factories , on the other hand , plays up this relationship between the workers and the products they make .
Many articles calculate : How long would it take for this worker to work in order to earn enough money to buy what he &apos;s making ?
For example , an entry-level-line assembly line worker in China in an iPhone plant would have to shell out two and a half months &apos; wages for an iPhone .
But how meaningful is this calculation , really ?
For example , I recently wrote an article in The New Yorker magazine , but I can &apos;t afford to buy an ad in it .
But , who cares ? I don &apos;t want an ad in The New Yorker , and most of these workers don &apos;t really want iPhones .
Their calculations are different .
How long should I stay in this factory ?
How much money can I save ?
How much will it take to buy an apartment or a car , to get married , or to put my child through school ?
The workers I got to know had a curiously abstract relationship with the product of their labor .
About a year after I met Lu Qingmin , or Min , she invited me home to her family village for the Chinese New Year .
On the train home , she gave me a present : a Coach brand change purse with brown leather trim .
I thanked her , assuming it was fake , like almost everything else for sale in Dongguan .
After we got home , Min gave her mother another present : a pink Dooney &amp; amp ; Bourke handbag , and a few nights later , her sister was showing off a maroon LeSportsac shoulder bag .
Slowly it was dawning on me that these handbags were made by their factory , and every single one of them was authentic .
Min &apos;s sister said to her parents , &quot; In America , this bag sells for 320 dollars . &quot;
Her parents , who are both farmers , looked on , speechless .
&quot; And that &apos;s not all -- Coach is coming out with a new line , 2191 , &quot; she said . &quot; One bag will sell for 6,000 . &quot;
She paused and said , &quot; I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s 6,000 yuan or 6,000 American dollars , but anyway , it &apos;s 6,000 . &quot;
Min &apos;s sister &apos;s boyfriend , who had traveled home with her for the new year , said , &quot; It doesn &apos;t look like it &apos;s worth that much . &quot;
Min &apos;s sister turned to him and said , &quot; Some people actually understand these things . You don &apos;t understand shit . &quot;
In Min &apos;s world , the Coach bags had a curious currency .
They weren &apos;t exactly worthless , but they were nothing close to the actual value , because almost no one they knew wanted to buy one , or knew how much it was worth .
Once , when Min &apos;s older sister &apos;s friend got married , she brought a handbag along as a wedding present .
Another time , after Min had already left the handbag factory , her younger sister came to visit , bringing two Coach Signature handbags as gifts .
I looked in the zippered pocket of one , and I found a printed card in English , which read , &quot; An American classic .
In 1941 , the burnished patina of an all-American baseball glove inspired the founder of Coach to create a new collection of handbags from the same luxuriously soft gloved-hand leather .
Six skilled leatherworkers crafted 12 Signature handbags with perfect proportions and a timeless flair .
They were fresh , functional , and women everywhere adored them . A new American classic was born . &quot;
I wonder what Karl Marx would have made of Min and her sisters .
Their relationship with the product of their labor was more complicated , surprising and funny than he could have imagined .
And yet , his view of the world persists , and our tendency to see the workers as faceless masses , to imagine that we can know what they &apos;re really thinking .
The first time I met Min , she had just turned 18 and quit her first job on the assembly line of an electronics factory .
Over the next two years , I watched as she switched jobs five times , eventually landing a lucrative post in the purchasing department of a hardware factory .
Later , she married a fellow migrant worker , moved with him to his village , gave birth to two daughters , and saved enough money to buy a secondhand Buick for herself and an apartment for her parents .
She recently returned to Dongguan on her own to take a job in a factory that makes construction cranes , temporarily leaving her husband and children back in the village .
In a recent email to me , she explained , &quot; A person should have some ambition while she is young so that in old age she can look back on her life and feel that it was not lived to no purpose . &quot;
Across China , there are 150 million workers like her , one third of them women , who have left their villages to work in the factories , the hotels , the restaurants and the construction sites of the big cities .
Together , they make up the largest migration in history , and it is globalization , this chain that begins in a Chinese farming village and ends with iPhones in our pockets and Nikes on our feet and Coach handbags on our arms that has changed the way these millions of people work and marry and live and think .
Very few of them would want to go back to the way things used to be .
When I first went to Dongguan , I worried that it would be depressing to spend so much time with workers .
I also worried that nothing would ever happen to them , or that they would have nothing to say to me .
Instead , I found young women who were smart and funny and brave and generous .
By opening up their lives to me , they taught me so much about factories and about China and about how to live in the world .
This is the Coach purse that Min gave me on the train home to visit her family .
I keep it with me to remind me of the ties that tie me to the young women I wrote about , ties that are not economic but personal in nature , measured not in money but in memories .
This purse is also a reminder that the things that you imagine , sitting in your office or in the library , are not how you find them when you actually go out into the world .
Thank you .
Thank you , Leslie , that was an insight that a lot of us haven &apos;t had before .
But I &apos;m curious . If you had a minute , say , with Apple &apos;s head of manufacturing , what would you say ?
Leslie Chang : One minute ?
One minute .
LC : You know , what really impressed me about the workers is how much they &apos;re self-motivated , self-driven , resourceful , and the thing that struck me , what they want most is education , to learn , because most of them come from very poor backgrounds .
They usually left school when they were in 7th or 8th grade .
Their parents are often illiterate , and then they come to the city , and they , on their own , at night , during the weekends , they &apos;ll take a computer class , they &apos;ll take an English class , and learn really , really rudimentary things , you know , like how to type a document in Word , or how to say really simple things in English .
So , if you really want to help these workers , start these small , very focused , very pragmatic classes in these schools , and what &apos;s going to happen is , all your workers are going to move on , but hopefully they &apos;ll move on into higher jobs within Apple , and you can help their social mobility and their self-improvement .
When you talk to workers , that &apos;s what they want .
They do not say , &quot; I want better hot water in the showers .
I want a nicer room . I want a TV set . &quot;
I mean , it would be nice to have those things , but that &apos;s not why they &apos;re in the city , and that &apos;s not what they care about .
Was there a sense from them of a narrative that things were kind of tough and bad , or was there a narrative of some kind of level of growth , that things over time were getting better ?
LC : Oh definitely , definitely . I mean , you know , it was interesting , because I spent basically two years hanging out in this city , Dongguan , and over that time , you could see immense change in every person &apos;s life : upward , downward , sideways , but generally upward .
If you spend enough time , it &apos;s upward , and I met people who had moved to the city 10 years ago , and who are now basically urban middle class people , so the trajectory is definitely upward .
It &apos;s just hard to see when you &apos;re suddenly sucked into the city . It looks like everyone &apos;s poor and desperate , but that &apos;s not really how it is .
Certainly , the factory conditions are really tough , and it &apos;s nothing you or I would want to do , but from their perspective , where they &apos;re coming from is much worse , and where they &apos;re going is hopefully much better , and I just wanted to give that context of what &apos;s going on in their minds , not what necessarily is going on in yours .
Thanks so much for your talk .
Thank you very much .

&lt; title &gt; Leslie T. Chang : The voices of China &apos;s workers &lt; / title &gt;
&lt; description &gt; In the ongoing debate about globalization , what &apos;s been missing is the voices of workers -- the millions of people who migrate to factories in China and other emerging countries to make goods sold all over the world . Reporter Leslie T. Chang sought out women who work in one of China &apos;s booming megacities , and tells their stories . &lt; / description &gt;

To most of you , this is a device to buy , sell , play games , watch videos .
I think it might be a lifeline .
I think actually it might be able to save more lives than penicillin .
Texting : I know I say texting and a lot of you think sexting , a lot of you think about the lewd photos that you see -- hopefully not your kids sending to somebody else -- or trying to translate the abbreviations LOL , LMAO , HMU .
I can help you with those later .
But the parents in the room know that texting is actually the best way to communicate with your kids .
It might be the only way to communicate with your kids .
The average teenager sends 3,339 text messages a month , unless she &apos;s a girl , then it &apos;s closer to 4,000 .
And the secret is she opens every single one .
Texting has a 100 percent open rate .
Now the parents are really alarmed .
It &apos;s a 100 percent open rate even if she doesn &apos;t respond to you when you ask her when she &apos;s coming home for dinner .
I promise she read that text .
And this isn &apos;t some suburban iPhone-using teen phenomenon .
Texting actually overindexes for minority and urban youth .
I know this because at DoSomething.org , which is the largest organization for teenagers and social change in America , about six months ago we pivoted and started focusing on text messaging .
We &apos;re now texting out to about 200,000 kids a week about doing our campaigns to make their schools more green or to work on homeless issues and things like that .
We &apos;re finding it 11 times more powerful than email .
We &apos;ve also found an unintended consequence .
We &apos;ve been getting text messages back like these .
&quot; I don &apos;t want to go to school today .
The boys call me faggot . &quot;
&quot; I was cutting , my parents found out , and so I stopped .
But I just started again an hour ago . &quot;
Or , &quot; He won &apos;t stop raping me .
He told me not to tell anyone .
It &apos;s my dad . Are you there ? &quot;
That last one &apos;s an actual text message that we received .
And yeah , we &apos;re there .
I will not forget the day we got that text message .
And so it was that day that we decided we needed to build a crisis text hotline .
Because this isn &apos;t what we do .
We do social change .
Kids are just sending us these text messages because texting is so familiar and comfortable to them and there &apos;s nowhere else to turn that they &apos;re sending them to us .
So think about it , a text hotline ; it &apos;s pretty powerful .
It &apos;s fast , it &apos;s pretty private .
No one hears you in a stall , you &apos;re just texting quietly .
It &apos;s real time .
We can help millions of teens with counseling and referrals .
That &apos;s great .
But the thing that really makes this awesome is the data .
Because I &apos;m not really comfortable just helping that girl with counseling and referrals .
I want to prevent this shit from happening .
So think about a cop .
There &apos;s something in New York City .
The police did it . It used to be just guess work , police work .
And then they started crime mapping .
And so they started following and watching petty thefts , summonses , all kinds of things -- charting the future essentially .
And they found things like , when you see crystal meth on the street , if you add police presence , you can curb the otherwise inevitable spate of assaults and robberies that would happen .
In fact , the year after the NYPD put CompStat in place , the murder rate fell 60 percent .
So think about the data from a crisis text line .
There is no census on bullying and dating abuse and eating disorders and cutting and rape -- no census .
Maybe there &apos;s some studies , some longitudinal studies , that cost lots of money and took lots of time .
Or maybe there &apos;s some anecdotal evidence .
Imagine having real time data on every one of those issues .
You could inform legislation .
You could inform school policy .
You could say to a principal , &quot; You &apos;re having a problem every Thursday at three o &apos;clock .
What &apos;s going on in your school ? &quot;
You could see the immediate impact of legislation or a hateful speech that somebody gives in a school assembly and see what happens as a result .
This is really , to me , the power of texting and the power of data .
Because while people are talking about data , making it possible for Facebook to mine my friend from the third grade , or Target to know when it &apos;s time for me to buy more diapers , or some dude to build a better baseball team , I &apos;m actually really excited about the power of data and the power of texting to help that kid go to school , to help that girl stop cutting in the bathroom and absolutely to help that girl whose father &apos;s raping her .
Thank you .

&lt; url &gt; http : / / www.ted.com / talks / carolyn _ porco _ could _ a _ saturn _ moon _ harbor _ life.html &lt; / url &gt;
Two years ago here at TED I reported that we had discovered at Saturn , with the Cassini Spacecraft , an anomalously warm and geologically active region at the southern tip of the small Saturnine moon Enceladus , seen here .
This region seen here for the first time in the Cassini image taken in 2005 . This is the south polar region , with the famous tiger-stripe fractures crossing the south pole .
And seen just recently in late 2008 , here is that region again , now half in darkness because the southern hemisphere is experiencing the onset of August and eventually winter .
And I also reported that we &apos;d made this mind-blowing discovery -- this once-in-a-lifetime discovery of towering jets erupting from those fractures at the south pole , consisting of tiny water ice crystals accompanied by water vapor and simple organic compounds like carbon dioxide and methane .
And at that time two years ago I mentioned that we were speculating that these jets might in fact be geysers , and erupting from pockets or chambers of liquid water underneath the surface , but we weren &apos;t really sure .
However , the implications of those results -- of a possible environment within this moon that could support prebiotic chemistry , and perhaps life itself -- were so exciting that , in the intervening two years , we have focused more on Enceladus .
We &apos;ve flown the Cassini Spacecraft by this moon now several times , flying closer and deeper into these jets , into the denser regions of these jets , so that now we have come away with some very precise compositional measurements .
And we have found that the organic compounds coming from this moon are in fact more complex than we previously reported .
While they &apos;re not amino acids , we &apos;re now finding things like propane and benzene , hydrogen cyanide , and formaldehyde .
And the tiny water crystals here now look for all the world like they are frozen droplets of salty water , which is a discovery that suggests that not only do the jets come from pockets of liquid water , but that that liquid water is in contact with rock .
And that is a circumstance that could supply the chemical energy and the chemical compounds needed to sustain life .
So we are very encouraged by these results .
And we are much more confident now than we were two years ago that we might indeed have on this moon , under the south pole , an environment or a zone that is hospitable to living organisms .
Whether or not there are living organisms there , of course , is an entirely different matter .
And that will have to await the arrival , back at Enceladus , of the spacecrafts , hopefully some time in the near future , specifically equipped to address that particular question .
But in the meantime I invite you to imagine the day when we might journey to the Saturnine system , and visit the Enceladus interplanetary geyser park , just because we can .
Thank you .

&lt; url &gt; http : / / www.ted.com / talks / cameron _ sinclair _ the _ refugees _ of _ boom _ and _ bust.html &lt; / url &gt;
A few years ago , my eyes were opened to the dark side of the construction industry .
In 2006 , young Qatari students took me to go and see the migrant worker camps .
And since then I &apos;ve followed the unfolding issue of worker rights .
In the last six months , more than 300 skyscrapers in the UAE have been put on hold or canceled .
Behind the headlines that lay behind these buildings is the fate of the often-indentured construction worker .
1.1 million of them .
Mainly Indian , Pakistani , Sri Lankan and Nepalese , these laborers risk everything to make money for their families back home .
They pay a middle-man thousands of dollars to be there .
And when they arrive , they find themselves in labor camps with no water , no air conditioning , and their passports taken away .
While it &apos;s easy to point the finger at local officials and higher authorities , 99 percent of these people are hired by the private sector , and so therefore we &apos;re equally , if not more , accountable .
Groups like Buildsafe UAE have emerged , but the numbers are simply overwhelming .
In August 2008 , UAE public officials noted that 40 percent of the country &apos;s 1,098 labor camps had violated minimum health and fire safety regulations .
And last summer , more than 10,000 workers protested for the non-payment of wages , for the poor quality of food , and inadequate housing .
And then the financial collapse happened .
When the contractors have gone bust , as they &apos;ve been overleveraged like everyone else , the difference is everything goes missing , documentation , passports , and tickets home for these workers .
Currently , right now , thousands of workers are abandoned .
There is no way back home .
And there is no way , and no proof of arrival .
These are the boom-and-bust refugees .
The question is , as a building professional , as an architect , an engineer , as a developer , if you know this is going on , as we go to the sights every single week , are you complacent or complicit in the human rights violations ?
So let &apos;s forget your environmental footprint .
Let &apos;s think about your ethical footprint .
What good is it to build a zero-carbon , energy efficient complex , when the labor producing this architectural gem is unethical at best ?
Now , recently I &apos;ve been told I &apos;ve been taking the high road .
But , quite frankly , on this issue , there is no other road .
So let &apos;s not forget who is really paying the price of this financial collapse .
And that as we worry about our next job in the office , the next design that we can get , to keep our workers .
Let &apos;s not forget these men , who are truly dying to work .
Thank you .

Fifty years ago in the old Soviet Union , a team of engineers was secretly moving a large object through a desolate countryside .
With it , they were hoping to capture the minds of people everywhere by being the first to conquer outer space .
The rocket was huge .
And packed in its nose was a silver ball with two radios inside .
On October 4 , 1957 , they launched their rocket .
One of the Russian scientists wrote at the time : &quot; We are about to create a new planet that we will call Sputnik .
In the olden days , explorers like Vasco da Gama and Columbus had the good fortune to open up the terrestrial globe .
Now we have the good fortune to open up space .
And it is for those in the future to envy us our joy . &quot;
You &apos;re watching snippets from &quot; Sputnik , &quot; my fifth documentary feature , which is just about completed .
It tells the story of Sputnik , and the story of what happened to America as a result .
For days after the launch , Sputnik was a wonderful curiosity .
A man-made moon visible by ordinary citizens , it inspired awe and pride that humans had finally launched an object into space .
But just three days later , on a day they called Red Monday , the media and the politicians told us , and we believed , that Sputnik was proof that our enemy had beaten us in science and technology , and that they could now attack us with hydrogen bombs , using their Sputnik rocket as an IBM missile .
All hell broke loose .
Sputnik quickly became one of the three great shocks to hit America -- historians say the equal of Pearl Harbor or 9 / 11 .
It provoked the missile gap .
It exploded an arms race .
It began the space race .
Within a year , Congress funded huge weapons increases , and we went from 1,200 nuclear weapons to 20,000 .
And the reactions to Sputnik went far beyond weapons increases .
For example , some here will remember this day , June 1958 , the National Civil Defense Drill , where tens of millions of people in 78 cities went underground .
Or the Gallup Poll that showed that seven in 10 Americans believed that a nuclear war would happen , and that at least 50 percent of our population But Sputnik provoked wonderful changes as well .
For example , some in this room went to school on scholarship because of Sputnik .
Support for engineering , math and science -- education in general -- boomed .
And Vint Cerf points out that Sputnik led directly to ARPA , and the Internet , and , of course , NASA .
My feature documentary shows how a free society can be stampeded by those who know how to use media .
But it also shows how we can turn what appears at first to be a bad situation , into something that was overall very good for America .
&quot; Sputnik &quot; will soon be released .
In closing , I would like to take a moment to thank one of my investors : longtime TEDster , Jay Walker .
And I &apos;d like to thank you all .
.
Thank you , Chris .

&lt; url &gt; http : / / www.ted.com / talks / thomas _ heatherwick.html &lt; / url &gt;
Hello , my name is Thomas Heatherwick .
I have a studio in London that has a particular approach to designing buildings .
When I was growing up , I was exposed to making and crafts and materials and invention on a small scale .
And I was there looking at the larger scale of buildings and finding that the buildings that were around me and that were being designed and that were there in the publications I was seeing felt soulless and cold .
And there on the smaller scale , the scale of an earring or a ceramic pot or a musical instrument , was a materiality and a soulfulness .
And this influenced me .
The first building I built was 20 years ago .
And since , in the last 20 years , I &apos;ve developed a studio in London .
Sorry , this was my mother , by the way , in her bead shop in London .
I spent a lot of time counting beads and things like that .
I &apos;m just going to show , for people who don &apos;t know my studio &apos;s work , a few projects that we &apos;ve worked on .
This is a hospital building .
This is a shop for a bag company .
This is studios for artists .
This is a sculpture made from a million yards of wire and 150,000 glass beads the size of a golf ball .
And this is a window display .
And this is pair of cooling towers for an electricity substation next to St. Paul &apos;s Cathedral in London .
And this is a temple in Japan for a Buddhist monk .
And this is a cafe by the sea in Britain .
And just very quickly , something we &apos;ve been working on very recently is we were commissioned by the mayor of London to design a new bus that gave the passenger their freedom again .
Because the original Routemaster bus that some of you may be familiar with , which had this open platform at the back -- in fact , I think all our Routemasters are here in California now actually .
But they aren &apos;t in London .
And so you &apos;re stuck on a bus .
And if the bus is going to stop and it &apos;s three yards away from the bus stop , you &apos;re just a prisoner .
But the mayor of London wanted to reintroduce buses with this open platform .
So we &apos;ve been working with Transport for London , and that organization hasn &apos;t actually been responsible as a client for a new bus for 50 years .
And so we &apos;ve been very lucky to have a chance to work .
The brief is that the bus should use 40 percent less energy .
So it &apos;s got hybrid drive .
And we &apos;ve been working to try to improve everything from the fabric to the format and structure and aesthetics .
I was going to show four main projects .
And this is a project for a bridge .
And so we were commissioned to design a bridge that would open .
And openings seemed -- everyone loves opening bridges , but it &apos;s quite a basic thing .
I think we all kind of stand and watch .
But the bridges that we saw that opened and closed -- I &apos;m slightly squeamish -- but I once saw a photograph of a footballer who was diving for a ball .
And as he was diving , someone had stamped on his knee , and it had broken like this .
And then we looked at these kinds of bridges and just couldn &apos;t help feeling that it was a beautiful thing that had broken .
And so this is in Paddington in London .
And it &apos;s a very boring bridge , as you can see .
It &apos;s just steel and timber .
But instead of what it is , our focus was on the way it worked .
So we liked the idea that the two farthest bits of it would end up kissing each other .
We actually had to halve its speed , because everyone was too scared when we first did it .
So that &apos;s it speeded up .
A project that we &apos;ve been working on very recently is to design a new biomass power station -- so a power station that uses organic waste material .
In the news , the subject of where our future water is going to come from is in all the papers all the time .
And we used to be quite proud of the way we generated power .
But recently , any annual report of a power company doesn &apos;t have a power station on it .
It has a child running through a field , or something like that .
And so when a consortium of engineers approached us and asked us to work with them on this power station , our condition was that we would work with them and that , whatever we did , we were not just going to decorate a normal power station .
And instead , we had to learn -- we kind of forced them to teach us .
And so we spent time traveling with them and learning about all the different elements , and finding that there were plenty of inefficiencies that weren &apos;t being capitalized on .
That just taking a field and banging all these things out isn &apos;t necessarily the most efficient way that they could work .
So we looked at how we could compose all those elements -- instead of just litter , create one composition .
And what we found -- this area is one of the poorest parts of Britain .
It was voted the worst place in Britain to live .
And there are 2,000 new homes being built next to this power station .
So it felt this has a social dimension .
It has a symbolic importance .
And we should be proud of where our power is coming from , rather than something we are necessarily ashamed of .
So we were looking at how we could make a power station , that , instead of keeping people out and having a big fence around the outside , could be a place that pulls you in .
And it has to be -- I &apos;m trying to get my -- 250 feet high .
So it felt that what we could try to do is make a power park and actually bring the whole area in , and using the spare soil that &apos;s there on the site , we could make a power station that was silent as well .
Because just that soil could make the acoustic difference .
And we also found that we could make a more efficient structure and have a cost-effective way of making a structure to do this .
The finished project is meant to be more than just a power station .
It has a space where you could have a bar mitzvah at the top .
And it &apos;s a power park .
So people can come and really experience this and also look out all around the area , and use that height that we have to have for its function .
In Shanghai , we were invited to build -- well we weren &apos;t invited ; what am I talking about .
We won the competition , and it was painful to get there .
So we won the competition to build the U.K. pavilion .
And an expo is a totally bonkers thing .
There &apos;s 250 pavilions .
It &apos;s the world &apos;s biggest ever expo that had ever happened .
So there are up to a million people there everyday .
And 250 countries all competing .
And the British government saying , &quot; You need to be in the top five . &quot;
And so that became the governmental goal -- is , how do you stand out in this chaos , which is an expo of stimulus ?
So our sense was we had to do one thing , and only one thing , instead of trying to have everything .
And so what we also felt was that whatever we did we couldn &apos;t do a cheesy advert for Britain .
But the thing that was true , the expo was about the future of cities , and particularly the Victorians pioneered integrating nature into the cities .
And the world &apos;s first public park of modern times was in Britain .
And the world &apos;s first major botanical institution is in London , and they have this extraordinary project where they &apos;ve been collecting 25 percent of all the world &apos;s plant species .
So we suddenly realized that there was this thing .
And everyone agrees that trees are beautiful , and I &apos;ve never met anyone who says , &quot; I don &apos;t like trees . &quot;
And the same with flowers .
I &apos;ve never met anyone who says , &quot; I don &apos;t like flowers . &quot;
But we realized that seeds -- there &apos;s been this very serious project happening -- but that seeds -- at these major botanical gardens , seeds aren &apos;t on show .
But you just have to go to a garden center , and they &apos;re in little paper packets .
But this phenomenal project &apos;s been happening .
So we realized we had to make a project that would be seeds , some kind of seed cathedral .
But how could we show these teeny-weeny things ?
And the film &quot; Jurassic Park &quot; actually really helped us .
Because the DNA of the dinosaur that was trapped in the amber gave us some kind of clue that these tiny things could be trapped and be made to seem precious , rather than looking like nuts .
So the challenge was , how are we going to bring light and expose these things ?
We didn &apos;t want to make a separate building and have separate content .
So we were trying to think , how could we make a whole thing emanate .
By the way , we had half the budget of the other Western nations .
So that was also in the mix with the site the size of a football pitch .
And so there was one particular toy that gave us a clue .
Voice Over : The new Play-Doh Mop Top Hair Shop .
Song : We &apos;ve got the Mop Tops , the Play-Doh Mop Tops Just turn the chair and grow Play-Doh hair They &apos;re the Mop Tops Thomas Heatherwick : Okay , you get the idea .
So the idea was to take these 66,000 seeds that they agreed to give us , and to take each seed and trap it in this precious optical hair and grow that through this box , very simple box element , and make it a building that could move in the wind .
So the whole thing can gently move when the wind blows .
And inside , the daylight -- each one is an optic and it brings light into the center .
And by night , artificial light in each one emanates and comes out to the outside .
And to make the project affordable , we focused our energy .
Instead of building a building as big as the football pitch , we focused it on this one element .
And the government agreed to do that and not do anything else , and focus our energy on that .
And so the rest of the site was a public space .
And with a million people there a day , it just felt like offering some public space .
We worked with an AstroTurf manufacturer to develop a mini-me version of the seed cathedral , so that , even if you &apos;re partially-sighted , that it was kind of crunchy and soft , that piece of landscape that you see there .
And then , you know when a pet has an operation and they shave a bit of the skin and get rid of the fur -- in order to get you to go into the seed cathedral , in effect , we &apos;ve shaved it .
And inside there &apos;s nothing ; there &apos;s no famous actor &apos;s voice ; there &apos;s no projections ; there &apos;s no televisions ; there &apos;s no color changing .
There &apos;s just silence and a cool temperature .
And if a cloud goes past , you can see a cloud on the tips where it &apos;s letting the light through .
This is the only project that we &apos;ve done where the finished thing looked more like a rendering than our renderings .
A key thing was how people would interact .
I mean , in a way it was the most serious thing you could possible do at the expo .
And I just wanted to show you .
The British government -- any government is potentially the worst client in the world you could ever possibly want to have .
And there was a lot of terror .
But there was an underlying support .
And so there was a moment when suddenly -- actually , the next thing .
This is the head of U.K. Trade and Investment , who was our client , with the Chinese children , using the landscape .
Children : One , two , three , go .
TH : I &apos;m sorry about my stupid voice there .
So finally , texture is something .
In the projects we &apos;ve been working on , these slick buildings , where they might be a fancy shape , but the materiality feels the same , is something that we &apos;ve been trying to research really , and explore alternatives .
And the project that we &apos;re building in Malaysia is apartment buildings for a property developer .
And it &apos;s in a piece of land that &apos;s this site .
And the mayor of Kuala Lumpur said that , if this developer would give something that gave something back to the city , they would give them more gross floor area , buildable .
So there was an incentive for the developer to really try to think about what would be better for the city .
And the conventional thing with apartment buildings in this part of the world is you have your tower , and you squeeze a few trees around the edge , and you see cars parked .
It &apos;s actually only the first couple of floors that you really experience , and the rest of it is just for postcards .
The lowest value is actually the bottom part of a tower like this .
So if we could chop that away and give the building a small bottom , we could take that bit and put it at the top where the greater commercial value is for a property developer .
And by linking these together , we could have 90 percent of the site as a rainforest , instead of only 10 percent of scrubby trees and bits of road around buildings .
So we &apos;re building these buildings .
They &apos;re actually identical , so it &apos;s quite cost-effective .
They &apos;re just chopped at different heights .
But the key part is trying to give back an extraordinary piece of landscape , rather than engulf it .
And that &apos;s my final slide .
Thank you .
Thank you .
So thank you . Thank you , Thomas . You &apos;re a delight .
Since we have an extra minute here , I thought perhaps you could tell us a little bit about these seeds , which maybe came from the shaved bit of the building .
TH : These are a few of the tests we did when we were building the structure .
So there were 66,000 of these .
This optic was 22 feet long .
And so the daylight was just coming -- it was caught on the outside of the box and was coming down to illuminate each seed .
Waterproofing the building was a bit crazy .
Because it &apos;s quite hard to waterproof buildings anyway , but if you say you &apos;re going to drill 66,000 holes in it -- we had quite a time .
There was one person in the contractors who was the right size -- and it wasn &apos;t a child -- who could fit between them for the final waterproofing of the building .
Thank you , Thomas .

They &apos;ve been here for billions of years , and what they are are single-celled microscopic organisms .
So they are one cell and they have this special property that they only have one piece of DNA .
They have very few genes , and genetic information to encode all of the traits that they carry out .
And the way bacteria make a living is that they consume nutrients from the environment , they grow to twice their size , they cut themselves down in the middle , and one cell becomes two , and so on and so on .
They just grow and divide , and grow and divide -- so a kind of boring life , except that what I would argue is that you have an amazing interaction with these critters .
I know you guys think of yourself as humans , and this is sort of how I think of you .
This man is supposed to represent a generic human being , and all of the circles in that man are all of the cells that make up your body .
There is about a trillion human cells that make each one of us who we are and able to do all the things that we do , but you have 10 trillion bacterial cells in you or on you at any moment in your life .
So , 10 times more bacterial cells than human cells on a human being .
And of course it &apos;s the DNA that counts , so here &apos;s all the A , T , Gs and Cs that make up your genetic code , and give you all your charming characteristics .
You have about 30,000 genes .
Well it turns out you have 100 times more bacterial genes playing a role in you or on you all of your life .
At the best , you &apos;re 10 percent human , but more likely about one percent human , depending on which of these metrics you like .
I know you think of yourself as human beings , but I think of you as 90 or 99 percent bacterial .
These bacteria are not passive riders , these are incredibly important , they keep us alive .
They cover us in an invisible body armor that keeps environmental insults out so that we stay healthy .
They digest our food , they make our vitamins , they actually educate your immune system to keep bad microbes out .
So they do all these amazing things that help us and are vital for keeping us alive , and they never get any press for that .
But they get a lot of press because they do a lot of terrible things as well .
So , there &apos;s all kinds of bacteria on the Earth that have no business being in you or on you at any time , and if they are , they make you incredibly sick .
And so , the question for my lab is whether you want to think about all the good things that bacteria do , or all the bad things that bacteria do .
The question we had is how could they do anything at all ?
I mean they &apos;re incredibly small , you have to have a microscope to see one .
They live this sort of boring life where they grow and divide , and they &apos;ve always been considered to be these asocial reclusive organisms .
And so it seemed to us that they are just too small to have an impact on the environment if they simply act as individuals .
And so we wanted to think if there couldn &apos;t be a different way that bacteria live .
The clue to this came from another marine bacterium , and it &apos;s a bacterium called Vibrio fischeri .
What you &apos;re looking at on this slide is just a person from my lab holding a flask of a liquid culture of a bacterium , a harmless beautiful bacterium that comes from the ocean , named Vibrio fischeri .
This bacterium has the special property that it makes light , so it makes bioluminescence , like fireflies make light .
We &apos;re not doing anything to the cells here .
We just took the picture by turning the lights off in the room , and this is what we see .
What was actually interesting to us was not that the bacteria made light , but when the bacteria made light .
What we noticed is when the bacteria were alone , so when they were in dilute suspension , they made no light .
But when they grew to a certain cell number all the bacteria turned on light simultaneously .
The question that we had is how can bacteria , these primitive organisms , tell the difference from times when they &apos;re alone , and times when they &apos;re in a community , and then all do something together .
What we &apos;ve figured out is that the way that they do that is that they talk to each other , and they talk with a chemical language .
This is now supposed to be my bacterial cell .
When it &apos;s alone it doesn &apos;t make any light .
But what it does do is to make and secrete small molecules that you can think of like hormones , and these are the red triangles , and when the bacteria is alone the molecules just float away and so no light .
But when the bacteria grow and double and they &apos;re all participating in making these molecules , the molecule -- the extracellular amount of that molecule increases in proportion to cell number .
And when the molecule hits a certain amount that tells the bacteria how many neighbors there are , they recognize that molecule and all of the bacteria turn on light in synchrony .
That &apos;s how bioluminescence works -- they &apos;re talking with these chemical words .
The reason that Vibrio fischeri is doing that comes from the biology .
Again , another plug for the animals in the ocean , Vibrio fischeri lives in this squid .
What you are looking at is the Hawaiian Bobtail Squid , and it &apos;s been turned on its back , and what I hope you can see are these two glowing lobes and these house the Vibrio fischeri cells , they live in there , at high cell number The reason the squid is willing to put up with these shenanigans is because it wants that light .
The way that this symbiosis works is that this little squid lives just off the coast of Hawaii , just in sort of shallow knee-deep water .
The squid is nocturnal , so during the day it buries itself in the sand and sleeps , but then at night it has to come out to hunt .
On bright nights when there is lots of starlight or moonlight that light can penetrate the depth of the water the squid lives in , since it &apos;s just in those couple feet of water .
What the squid has developed is a shutter that can open and close over this specialized light organ housing the bacteria .
Then it has detectors on its back so it can sense how much starlight or moonlight is hitting its back .
And it opens and closes the shutter so the amount of light coming out of the bottom -- which is made by the bacterium -- exactly matches how much light hits the squid &apos;s back , so the squid doesn &apos;t make a shadow .
It actually uses the light from the bacteria to counter-illuminate itself in an anti-predation device so predators can &apos;t see its shadow , calculate its trajectory , and eat it .
This is like the stealth bomber of the ocean .
But then if you think about it , the squid has this terrible problem because it &apos;s got this dying , thick culture of bacteria and it can &apos;t sustain that .
And so what happens is every morning when the sun comes up the squid goes back to sleep , it buries itself in the sand , and it &apos;s got a pump that &apos;s attached to its circadian rhythm , and when the sun comes up it pumps out like 95 percent of the bacteria .
Now the bacteria are dilute , that little hormone molecule is gone , so they &apos;re not making light -- but of course the squid doesn &apos;t care . It &apos;s asleep in the sand .
And as the day goes by the bacteria double , they release the molecule , and then light comes on at night , exactly when the squid wants it .
First we figured out how this bacterium does this , but then we brought the tools of molecular biology to this to figure out really what &apos;s the mechanism .
And what we found -- so this is now supposed to be , again , my bacterial cell -- is that Vibrio fischeri has a protein -- that &apos;s the red box -- it &apos;s an enzyme that makes that little hormone molecule , the red triangle .
And then as the cells grow , they &apos;re all releasing that molecule into the environment , so there &apos;s lots of molecule there .
And the bacteria also have a receptor on their cell surface that fits like a lock and key with that molecule .
These are just like the receptors on the surfaces of your cells .
When the molecule increases to a certain amount -- which says something about the number of cells -- it locks down into that receptor and information comes into the cells that tells the cells to turn on this collective behavior of making light .
Why this is interesting is because in the past decade we have found that this is not just some anomaly of this ridiculous , glow-in-the-dark bacterium that lives in the ocean -- all bacteria have systems like this .
So now what we understand is that all bacteria can talk to each other .
They make chemical words , they recognize those words , and they turn on group behaviors that are only successful when all of the cells participate in unison .
We have a fancy name for this : we call it quorum sensing .
They vote with these chemical votes , the vote gets counted , and then everybody responds to the vote .
What &apos;s important for today &apos;s talk is that we know that there are hundreds of behaviors that bacteria carry out in these collective fashions .
But the one that &apos;s probably the most important to you is virulence .
It &apos;s not like a couple bacteria get in you and they start secreting some toxins -- you &apos;re enormous , that would have no effect on you . You &apos;re huge .
What they do , we now understand , is they get in you , they wait , they start growing , they count themselves with these little molecules , and they recognize when they have the right cell number that if all of the bacteria launch their virulence attack together , they are going to be successful at overcoming an enormous host .
Bacteria always control pathogenicity with quorum sensing .
That &apos;s how it works .
We also then went to look at what are these molecules -- these were the red triangles on my slides before .
This is the Vibrio fischeri molecule .
This is the word that it talks with .
So then we started to look at other bacteria , and these are just a smattering of the molecules that we &apos;ve discovered .
What I hope you can see is that the molecules are related .
The left-hand part of the molecule is identical in every single species of bacteria .
But the right-hand part of the molecule is a little bit different in every single species .
What that does is to confer exquisite species specificities to these languages .
Each molecule fits into its partner receptor and no other .
So these are private , secret conversations .
These conversations are for intraspecies communication .
Each bacteria uses a particular molecule that &apos;s its language that allows it to count its own siblings .
Once we got that far we thought we were starting to understand that bacteria have these social behaviors .
But what we were really thinking about is that most of the time bacteria don &apos;t live by themselves , they live in incredible mixtures , with hundreds or thousands of other species of bacteria .
And that &apos;s depicted on this slide . This is your skin .
So this is just a picture -- a micrograph of your skin .
Anywhere on your body , it looks pretty much like this , and what I hope you can see is that there &apos;s all kinds of bacteria there .
And so we started to think if this really is about communication in bacteria , and it &apos;s about counting your neighbors , it &apos;s not enough to be able to only talk within your species .
There has to be a way to take a census of the rest of the bacteria in the population .
So we went back to molecular biology and started studying different bacteria , and what we &apos;ve found now is that in fact , bacteria are multilingual .
They all have a species-specific system -- they have a molecule that says &quot; me . &quot;
But then , running in parallel to that is a second system that we &apos;ve discovered , that &apos;s generic .
So , they have a second enzyme that makes a second signal and it has its own receptor , and this molecule is the trade language of bacteria .
It &apos;s used by all different bacteria and it &apos;s the language of interspecies communication .
What happens is that bacteria are able to count how many of me and how many of you .
They take that information inside , and they decide what tasks to carry out depending on who &apos;s in the minority and who &apos;s in the majority of any given population .
Then again we turn to chemistry , and we figured out what this generic molecule is -- that was the pink ovals on my last slide , this is it .
It &apos;s a very small , five-carbon molecule .
What the important thing is that we learned is that every bacterium has exactly the same enzyme and makes exactly the same molecule .
So they &apos;re all using this molecule for interspecies communication .
This is the bacterial Esperanto .
Once we got that far , we started to learn that bacteria can talk to each other with this chemical language .
But what we started to think is that maybe there is something practical that we can do here as well .
I &apos;ve told you that bacteria do have all these social behaviors , they communicate with these molecules .
Of course , I &apos;ve also told you that one of the important things they do is to initiate pathogenicity using quorum sensing .
We thought , what if we made these bacteria so they can &apos;t talk or they can &apos;t hear ?
Couldn &apos;t these be new kinds of antibiotics ?
Of course , you &apos;ve just heard and you already know that we &apos;re running out of antibiotics .
Bacteria are incredibly multi-drug-resistant right now , and that &apos;s because all of the antibiotics that we use kill bacteria .
They either pop the bacterial membrane , they make the bacterium so it can &apos;t replicate its DNA .
We kill bacteria with traditional antibiotics and that selects for resistant mutants .
And so now of course we have this global problem in infectious diseases .
We thought , well what if we could sort of do behavior modifications , just make these bacteria so they can &apos;t talk , they can &apos;t count , and they don &apos;t know to launch virulence .
And so that &apos;s exactly what we &apos;ve done , and we &apos;ve sort of taken two strategies .
The first one is we &apos;ve targeted the intraspecies communication system .
So we made molecules that look kind of like the real molecules -- which you saw -- but they &apos;re a little bit different .
And so they lock into those receptors , and they jam recognition of the real thing .
By targeting the red system , what we are able to do is to make species-specific , or disease-specific , anti-quorum sensing molecules .
We &apos;ve also done the same thing with the pink system .
We &apos;ve taken that universal molecule and turned it around a little bit so that we &apos;ve made antagonists of the interspecies communication system .
The hope is that these will be used as broad-spectrum antibiotics that work against all bacteria .
To finish I &apos;ll just show you the strategy .
In this one I &apos;m just using the interspecies molecule , but the logic is exactly the same .
What you know is that when that bacterium gets into the animal , in this case , a mouse , it doesn &apos;t initiate virulence right away .
It gets in , it starts growing , it starts secreting its quorum sensing molecules .
It recognizes when it has enough bacteria and the animal dies .
What we &apos;ve been able to do is to give these virulent infections , but we give them in conjunction with our anti-quorum sensing molecules -- so these are molecules that look kind of like the real thing , but they &apos;re a little bit different which I &apos;ve depicted on this slide .
What we now know is that if we treat the animal with a pathogenic bacterium -- a multi-drug-resistant pathogenic bacterium -- in the same time we give our anti-quorum sensing molecule , in fact , the animal lives .
We think that this is the next generation of antibiotics and it &apos;s going to get us around , at least initially , this big problem of resistance .
What I hope you think , is that bacteria can talk to each other , they use chemicals as their words , they have an incredibly complicated chemical lexicon that we &apos;re just now starting to learn about .
Of course what that allows bacteria to do is to be multicellular .
So in the spirit of TED they &apos;re doing things together because it makes a difference .
What happens is that bacteria have these collective behaviors , and they can carry out tasks that they could never accomplish if they simply acted as individuals .
What I would hope that I could further argue to you is that this is the invention of multicellularity .
Bacteria have been on the Earth for billions of years ; humans , couple hundred thousand .
We think bacteria made the rules for how multicellular organization works .
We think , by studying bacteria , we &apos;re going to be able to have insight about multicellularity in the human body .
We know that the principles and the rules , if we can figure them out in these sort of primitive organisms , the hope is that they will be applied to other human diseases and human behaviors as well .
I hope that what you &apos;ve learned is that bacteria can distinguish self from other .
By using these two molecules they can say &quot; me &quot; and they can say &quot; you . &quot;
Again of course that &apos;s what we do , both in a molecular way , and also in an outward way , but I think about the molecular stuff .
This is exactly what happens in your body .
It &apos;s not like your heart cells and your kidney cells get all mixed up every day , and that &apos;s because there &apos;s all of this chemistry going on , these molecules that say who each of these groups of cells is , and what their tasks should be .
Again , we think that bacteria invented that , and you &apos;ve just evolved a few more bells and whistles , but all of the ideas are in these simple systems that we can study .
The final thing is , again just to reiterate that there &apos;s this practical part , and so we &apos;ve made these anti-quorum sensing molecules that are being developed as new kinds of therapeutics .
But then , to finish with a plug for all the good and miraculous bacteria that live on the Earth , we &apos;ve also made pro-quorum sensing molecules .
So , we &apos;ve targeted those systems to make the molecules work better .
Remember you have these 10 times or more bacterial cells in you or on you , keeping you healthy .
What we &apos;re also trying to do is to beef up the conversation of the bacteria that live as mutualists with you , in the hopes of making you more healthy , making those conversations better , better than they would be on their own .
Finally , I wanted to show you this is my gang at Princeton , New Jersey .
Everything I told you about was discovered by someone in that picture .
I hope when you learn things , like about how the natural world works -- I just want to say that whenever you read something in the newspaper or you get to hear some talk about something ridiculous in the natural world it was done by a child .
Science is done by that demographic .
All of those people are between 20 and 30 years old , and they are the engine that drives scientific discovery in this country .
It &apos;s a really lucky demographic to work with .
I keep getting older and older and they &apos;re always the same age , and it &apos;s just a crazy delightful job .
I want to thank you for inviting me here .
It &apos;s a big treat for me to get to come to this conference .
Thanks .
&lt; title &gt; Bonnie Bassler : How bacteria &quot; talk &quot; &lt; / title &gt;
&lt; description &gt; Bonnie Bassler discovered that bacteria &quot; talk &quot; to each other , using a chemical language that lets them coordinate defense and mount attacks . The find has stunning implications for medicine , industry -- and our understanding of ourselves . &lt; / description &gt;

I want to open by quoting Einstein &apos;s wonderful statement , just so people will feel at ease that the great scientist of the 20th century also agrees with us , and also calls us to this action .
He said , &quot; A human being is a part of the whole , called by us , the &apos; universe , &apos; -- a part limited in time and space .
He experiences himself , his thoughts and feelings , as something separated from the rest , a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness .
This delusion is a kind of prison for us , restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us .
Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion , to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty . &quot;
This insight of Einstein &apos;s is uncannily close to that of Buddhist psychology , wherein compassion -- &quot; karuna , &quot; it is called -- is defined as , &quot; the sensitivity to another &apos;s suffering and the corresponding will to free the other from that suffering . &quot;
It pairs closely with love , which is the will for the other to be happy , which requires , of course , that one feels some happiness oneself and wishes to share it .
This is perfect in that it clearly opposes self-centeredness and selfishness to compassion , the concern for others , and , further , it indicates that those caught in the cycle of self-concern suffer helplessly , while the compassionate are more free and , implicitly , more happy .
The Dalai Lama often states that compassion is his best friend .
It helps him when he is overwhelmed with grief and despair .
Compassion helps him turn away from the feeling of his suffering as the most absolute , most terrible suffering anyone has ever had and broadens his awareness of the sufferings of others , even of the perpetrators of his misery and the whole mass of beings .
In fact , suffering is so huge and enormous , his own becomes less and less monumental .
And he begins to move beyond his self-concern into the broader concern for others .
And this immediately cheers him up , as his courage is stimulated to rise to the occasion .
Thus , he uses his own suffering as a doorway to widening his circle of compassion .
He is a very good colleague of Einstein &apos;s , we must say .
Now , I want to tell a story , which is a very famous story in the Indian and Buddhist tradition , of the great Saint Asanga who was a contemporary of Augustine in the West and was sort of like the Buddhist Augustine .
And Asanga lived 800 years after the Buddha &apos;s time .
And he was discontented with the state of people &apos;s practice And so he said , &quot; I &apos;m sick of all this . Nobody &apos;s really living the doctrine .
They &apos;re talking about love and compassion and wisdom and enlightenment , but they are acting selfish and pathetic .
So , Buddha &apos;s teaching has lost its momentum .
I know the next Buddha will come a few thousand years from now , but exists currently in a certain heaven &quot; -- that &apos;s Maitreya -- &quot; so , I &apos;m going to go on a retreat and I &apos;m going to meditate and pray until the Buddha Maitreya reveals himself to me , and gives me a teaching or something to revive the practice of compassion in the world today . &quot;
So he went on this retreat . And he meditated for three years and he did not see the future Buddha Maitreya .
And he left in disgust .
And as he was leaving , he saw a man -- a funny little man sitting sort of part way down the mountain .
And he had a lump of iron .
And he was rubbing it with a cloth .
And he became interested in that .
He said , &quot; Well what are you doing ? &quot;
And the man said , &quot; I &apos;m making a needle . &quot;
And he said , &quot; That &apos;s ridiculous . You can &apos;t make a needle by rubbing a lump of iron with a cloth . &quot;
And the man said , &quot; Really ? &quot; And he showed him a dish full of needles .
So he said , &quot; Okay , I get the point . &quot;
He went back to his cave . He meditated again .
Another three years , no vision . He leaves again .
This time , he comes down .
And as he &apos;s leaving , he sees a bird making a nest on a cliff ledge .
And where it &apos;s landing to bring the twigs to the cliff , its feathers brushes the rock -- and it had cut the rock six to eight inches in . There was a cleft in the rock by the brushing of the feathers of generations of the birds .
So he said , &quot; All right . I get the point . &quot; He went back .
Another three years .
Again , no vision of Maitreya after nine years .
And he again leaves , and this time : water dripping , making a giant bowl in the rock where it drips in a stream .
And so , again , he goes back . And after 12 years there is still no vision .
And he &apos;s freaked out . And he won &apos;t even look left or right to see any encouraging vision .
And he comes to the town . He &apos;s a broken person .
And there , in the town , he &apos;s approached by a dog who comes like this -- one of these terrible dogs you can see in some poor countries , even in America , I think , in some areas -- and he &apos;s looking just terrible .
And he becomes interested in this dog because it &apos;s so pathetic , and it &apos;s trying to attract his attention . And he sits down looking at the dog .
And the dog &apos;s whole hindquarters are a complete open sore .
Some of it is like gangrenous , and there are maggots in the flesh . And it &apos;s terrible .
He thinks , &quot; What can I do to fix up this dog ?
Well , at least I can clean this wound and wash it . &quot;
So , he takes it to some water . He &apos;s about to clean , but then his awareness focuses on the maggots .
And he sees the maggots , and the maggots are kind of looking a little cute .
And they &apos;re maggoting happily in the dog &apos;s hindquarters there .
&quot; Well , if I clean the dog , I &apos;ll kill the maggots . So how can that be ?
That &apos;s it . I &apos;m a useless person and there &apos;s no Buddha , no Maitreya , and everything is all hopeless .
And now I &apos;m going to kill the maggots ? &quot;
So , he had a brilliant idea .
And he took a shard of something , and cut a piece of flesh from his thigh , and he placed it on ground .
He was not really thinking too carefully about the ASPCA .
He was just immediately caught with the situation .
So he thought , &quot; I will take the maggots and put them on this piece of flesh , then clean the dog &apos;s wounds , and then I &apos;ll figure out what to do with the maggots . &quot;
So he starts to do that . He can &apos;t grab the maggots .
Apparently they wriggle around . They &apos;re kind of hard to grab , these maggots .
So he says , &quot; Well , I &apos;ll put my tongue on the dog &apos;s flesh .
And then the maggots will jump on my warmer tongue &quot; -- the dog is kind of used up -- &quot; and then I &apos;ll spit them one by one down on the thing . &quot;
So he goes down , and he &apos;s sticking his tongue out like this .
And he had to close his eyes , it &apos;s so disgusting , and the smell and everything .
And then , suddenly , there &apos;s a pfft , a noise like that .
He jumps back and there , of course , is the future Buddha Maitreya in a beautiful vision -- rainbow lights , golden , jeweled , a plasma body , an exquisite mystic vision -- that he sees .
And he says , &quot; Oh . &quot; He bows .
But , being human , he &apos;s immediately thinking of his next complaint .
So as he comes up from his first bow he says , &quot; My Lord , I &apos;m so happy to see you , but where have you been for 12 years ?
What is this ? &quot;
And Maitreya says , &quot; I was with you . Who do you think was making needles and making nests and dripping on rocks for you , mister dense ? &quot;
&quot; Looking for the Buddha in person , &quot; he said .
And he said , &quot; You didn &apos;t have , until this moment , real compassion .
And , until you have real compassion , you cannot recognize love . &quot;
&quot; Maitreya &quot; means love , &quot; the loving one , &quot; in Sanskrit .
And so he looked very dubious , Asanga did .
And he said , &quot; If you don &apos;t believe me , just take me with you . &quot;
And so he took the Maitreya -- it shrunk into a globe , a ball -- took him on his shoulder .
And he ran into town in the marketplace , and he said , &quot; Rejoice ! Rejoice !
The future Buddha has come ahead of all predictions . Here he is . &quot;
And then pretty soon they started throwing rocks and stones at him -- it wasn &apos;t Chautauqua , it was some other town -- because they saw a demented looking , scrawny looking yogi man , like some kind of hippie , with a bleeding leg and a rotten dog on his shoulder , shouting that the future Buddha had come .
So , naturally , they chased him out of town .
But on the edge of town , one elderly lady , a charwoman in the charnel ground , saw a jeweled foot on a jeweled lotus on his shoulder and then the dog , but she saw the jewel foot of the Maitreya , and she offered a flower .
So that encouraged him , and he went with Maitreya .
Maitreya then took him to a certain heaven , which is the typical way a Buddhist myth unfolds .
And Maitreya then kept him in heaven for five years , dictating to him five complicated tomes of the methodology of how you cultivate compassion .
And then I thought I would share with you what that method is , or one of them .
A famous one , it &apos;s called the &quot; Sevenfold Causal Method of Developing Compassion . &quot;
And it begins first by one meditating and visualizing that all beings are with one -- even animals too , but everyone is in human form .
The animals are in one of their human lives . The humans are human .
And then , among them , you think of your friends and loved ones , the circle at the table .
And you think of your enemies , and you think of the neutral ones .
And then you try to say , &quot; Well , the loved ones I love .
But , you know , after all , they &apos;re nice to me .
I had fights with them . Sometimes they were unfriendly .
I got mad . Brothers can fight . Parents and children can fight .
So , in a way , I like them so much because they &apos;re nice to me .
While the neutral ones I don &apos;t know . They could all be just fine .
And then the enemies I don &apos;t like because they &apos;re mean to me .
But they are nice to somebody . I could be them . &quot;
And then the Buddhists , of course , think that , because we &apos;ve all had infinite previous lives , we &apos;ve all been each other &apos;s relatives , actually .
Therefore all of you , in the Buddhist view , in some previous life , although you don &apos;t remember it and neither do I , have been my mother -- for which I do apologize for the trouble I caused you .
And also , actually , I &apos;ve been your mother .
I &apos;ve been female , and I &apos;ve been every single one of yours &apos; mother in a previous life , the way the Buddhists reflect .
So , my mother in this life is really great . But all of you in a way are part of the eternal mother .
You gave me that expression ; &quot; the eternal mama , &quot; you said . That &apos;s wonderful .
So , that &apos;s the way the Buddhists do it .
A theist Christian can think that all beings , even my enemies , are God &apos;s children .
So , in that sense , we &apos;re related .
So , they first create this foundation of equality .
So , we sort of reduce a little of the clinging to the ones we love -- just in the meditation -- and we open our mind to those we don &apos;t know .
And we definitely reduce the hostility and the &quot; I don &apos;t want to be compassionate to them &quot; to the ones we think of as the bad guys , the ones we hate and we don &apos;t like .
And we don &apos;t hate anyone , therefore . So we equalize . That &apos;s very important .
And then the next thing we do is what is called &quot; mother recognition . &quot;
And that is , we think of every being as familiar , as family .
We expand . We take the feeling about remembering a mama , and we defuse that to all beings in this meditation .
And we see the mother in every being .
We see that look that the mother has on her face , looking at this child that is a miracle that she has produced from her own body , being a mammal , where she has true compassion , truly is the other , and identifies completely .
Often the life of that other will be more important to her than her own life .
And that &apos;s why it &apos;s the most powerful form of altruism .
The mother is the model of all altruism for human beings , in spiritual traditions .
And so , we reflect until we can sort of see that motherly expression in all beings .
People laugh at me because , you know , I used to say that I used to meditate on mama Cheney as my mom , when , of course , I was annoyed with him about all of his evil doings in Iraq .
I used to meditate on George Bush . He &apos;s quite a cute mom in a female form .
He has his little ears and he smiles and he rocks you in his arms .
And you think of him as nursing you .
And then Saddam Hussein &apos;s serious mustache is a problem , but you think of him as a mom .
And this is the way you do it . You take any being who looks weird to you , and you see how they could be familiar to you .
And you do that for a while , until you really feel that .
You can feel the familiarity of all beings .
Nobody seems alien . They &apos;re not &quot; other . &quot;
You reduce the feeling of otherness about beings .
Then you move from there to remembering the kindness of mothers in general , if you can remember the kindness of your own mother , if you can remember the kindness of your spouse , or , if you are a mother yourself , how you were with your children .
And you begin to get very sentimental ; you cultivate sentimentality intensely .
You will even weep , perhaps , with gratitude and kindness .
And then you connect that with your feeling that everyone has that motherly possibility .
Every being , even the most mean looking ones , can be motherly .
And then , third , you step from there to what is called &quot; a feeling of gratitude . &quot;
You want to repay that kindness that all beings have shown to you .
And then the fourth step , you go to what is called &quot; lovely love . &quot;
In each one of these you can take some weeks , or months , or days depending on how you do it , or you can do them in a run , this meditation .
And then you think of how lovely beings are when they are happy , when they are satisfied .
And every being looks beautiful when they are internally feeling a happiness .
Their face doesn &apos;t look like this . When they &apos;re angry , they look ugly , every being , but when they &apos;re happy they look beautiful .
And so you see beings in their potential happiness .
And you feel a love toward them and you want them to be happy , even the enemy .
We think Jesus is being unrealistic when he says , &quot; Love thine enemy . &quot;
He does say that , and we think he &apos;s being unrealistic and sort of spiritual and highfalutin . &quot; Nice for him to say it , but I can &apos;t do that . &quot;
But , actually , that &apos;s practical .
If you love your enemy that means you want your enemy to be happy .
If your enemy was really happy , why would they bother to be your enemy ?
How boring to run around chasing you .
They would be relaxing somewhere having a good time .
So it makes sense to want your enemy to be happy , because they &apos;ll stop being your enemy because that &apos;s too much trouble .
But anyway , that &apos;s the &quot; lovely love . &quot; And then finally , the fifth step is compassion , &quot; universal compassion . &quot;
And that is where you then look at the reality of all the beings you can think of .
And you look at them , and you see how they are .
And you realize how unhappy they are actually , mostly , most of the time .
You see that furrowed brow in people .
And then you realize they don &apos;t even have compassion on themselves .
They &apos;re driven by this duty and this obligation .
&quot; I have to get that . I need more . I &apos;m not worthy . And I should do something . &quot;
And they &apos;re rushing around all stressed out .
And they think of it as somehow macho , hard discipline on themselves .
But actually they are cruel to themselves .
And , of course , they are cruel and ruthless toward others .
And they , then , never get any positive feedback .
And the more they succeed and the more power they have , the more unhappy they are .
And this is where you feel real compassion for them .
And you then feel you must act .
And the choice of the action , of course , hopefully will be more practical than poor Asanga , who was fixing the maggots on the dog because he had that motivation , and whoever was in front of him , he wanted to help .
But , of course , that is impractical . He should have founded the ASPCA in the town and gotten some scientific help for dogs and maggots .
And I &apos;m sure he did that later . But that just indicates the state of mind , you know .
And so the next step -- the sixth step beyond &quot; universal compassion &quot; -- is this thing where you &apos;re linked with the needs of others in a true way , and you have compassion for yourself also , and it isn &apos;t sentimental only . You might be in fear of something .
Some bad guy is making himself more and more unhappy being more and more mean to other people and getting punished in the future for it in various ways .
And in Buddhism , they catch it in the future life .
Of course in theistic religion they &apos;re punished by God or whatever .
And materialism , they think they get out of it just by not existing , by dying , but they don &apos;t .
And so they get reborn as whatever , you know .
Never mind . I won &apos;t get into that .
But the next step is called &quot; universal responsibility . &quot;
And that is very important -- the Charter of Compassion must lead us to develop through true compassion , what is called &quot; universal responsibility . &quot;
In the great teaching of his Holiness the Dalai Lama that he always teaches everywhere , he says that that is the common religion of humanity : kindness .
But &quot; kindness &quot; means &quot; universal responsibility . &quot;
And that means whatever happens to other beings is happening to us : we are responsible for that , and we should take it and do whatever we can at whatever little level and small level that we can do it .
We absolutely must do that . There is no way not to do it .
And then , finally , that leads to a new orientation in life where we live equally for ourselves and for others and we are joyful and happy .
One thing we mustn &apos;t think is that compassion makes you miserable .
Compassion makes you happy .
The first person who is happy when you get great compassion is yourself , even if you haven &apos;t done anything yet for anybody else .
Although , the change in your mind already does something for other beings : they can sense this new quality in yourself , and it helps them already , and gives them an example .
And that uncompassionate clock has just showed me that it &apos;s all over .
So , practice compassion , read the charter , disseminate it and develop it within yourself .
Don &apos;t just think , &quot; Well , I &apos;m compassionate , &quot; or &quot; I &apos;m not compassionate , &quot; and sort of think you &apos;re stuck there .
You can develop this . You can diminish the non-compassion , the cruelty , the callousness , the neglect of others , and take universal responsibility for them .
And then , not only will God smile and the eternal mama will smile , but Karen Armstrong will smile .
Thank you very much .

&lt; url &gt; http : / / www.ted.com / talks / matt _ cutts _ try _ something _ new _ for _ 30 _ days.html &lt; / url &gt;
A few years ago , I felt like I was stuck in a rut , so I decided to follow in the footsteps of the great American philosopher , Morgan Spurlock , and try something new for 30 days .
The idea is actually pretty simple .
Think about something you &apos;ve always wanted to add to your life and try it for the next 30 days .
It turns out , 30 days is just about the right amount of time to add a new habit or subtract a habit -- like watching the news -- from your life .
There &apos;s a few things I learned while doing these 30-day challenges .
The first was , instead of the months flying by , forgotten , the time was much more memorable .
This was part of a challenge I did to take a picture every day for a month .
And I remember exactly where I was and what I was doing that day .
I also noticed that as I started to do more and harder 30-day challenges , my self-confidence grew .
I went from desk-dwelling computer nerd to the kind of guy who bikes to work -- for fun .
Even last year , I ended up hiking up Mt . Kilimanjaro , the highest mountain in Africa .
I would never have been that adventurous before I started my 30-day challenges .
I also figured out that if you really want something badly enough , you can do anything for 30 days .
Have you ever wanted to write a novel ?
Every November , tens of thousands of people try to write their own 50,000-word novel from scratch in 30 days .
It turns out , all you have to do is write 1,667 words a day for a month .
So I did .
By the way , the secret is not to go to sleep until you &apos;ve written your words for the day .
You might be sleep-deprived , but you &apos;ll finish your novel .
Now is my book the next great American novel ?
No . I wrote it in a month .
It &apos;s awful .
But for the rest of my life , if I meet John Hodgman at a TED party , I don &apos;t have to say , &quot; I &apos;m a computer scientist . &quot;
No , no , if I want to , I can say , &quot; I &apos;m a novelist . &quot;
So here &apos;s one last thing I &apos;d like to mention .
I learned that when I made small , sustainable changes , things I could keep doing , they were more likely to stick .
There &apos;s nothing wrong with big , crazy challenges .
In fact , they &apos;re a ton of fun .
But they &apos;re less likely to stick .
When I gave up sugar for 30 days , day 31 looked like this .
So here &apos;s my question to you : What are you waiting for ?
I guarantee you the next 30 days are going to pass whether you like it or not , so why not think about something you have always wanted to try and give it a shot for the next 30 days .
Thanks .

For as long as I can remember , I have felt a very deep connection to animals and to the ocean .
And at this age , my personal idol was Flipper the dolphin .
And when I first learned about endangered species , I was truly distressed to know that every day animals were being wiped off the face of this Earth forever .
And I wanted to do something to help , but I always wondered , what could one person possibly do to make a difference ?
And it would be 30 years , but I would eventually get the answer to that question .
When these heartbreaking images of oiled birds finally began to emerge from the Gulf of Mexico last year during the horrific BP oil spill , a German biologist by the name of Silvia Gaus was quoted as saying , &quot; We should just euthanize all oiled birds because studies have shown that fewer than one percent of them survive after being released . &quot;
And I could not disagree more .
And in addition , I believe that every oiled animal deserves a second chance at life .
And I want to tell you why I feel so strongly about this .
On June 23rd , 2000 , a ship named the Treasure sank off the coast of Cape Town , South Africa , spilling 1,300 tons of fuel , which polluted the habitats of nearly half the entire world population of African penguins .
Now the ship sank between Robben Island to the south and Dassen Island to the north .
And these are two of the penguins &apos; main breeding islands .
And exactly six years and three days earlier , on June 20th , 1994 , a ship named the Apollo Sea sank near Dassen Island , oiling 10,000 penguins -- half of which died .
Now when the Treasure sank in 2000 , it was the height of the best breeding season scientists had ever recorded for the African penguin -- which at the time , was listed as a threatened species .
And soon , nearly 20,000 penguins were covered with this toxic oil .
And the local seabird rescue center , named SANCCOB , immediately launched a massive rescue operation -- and this soon would become the largest animal rescue ever undertaken .
Now at the time , I was working down the street .
I was a penguin aquarist at the New England Aquarium .
And exactly 11 years ago yesterday , the phone rang in the penguin office .
And with that call , my life would change forever .
It was Estelle van der Meer calling from SANCCOB , saying , &quot; Please come help .
We have thousands of oiled penguins and thousands of willing , but completely inexperienced , volunteers .
And we need penguin experts to come train and supervise them . &quot;
So two days later , I was on a plane headed for Cape Town with a team of penguin specialists .
And the scene inside of this building was devastating and surreal .
In fact , many people compared it to a war zone .
And last week , a 10 year-old girl asked me , &quot; What did it feel like when you first walked into that building and saw so many oiled penguins ? &quot;
And this is what happened .
I was instantly transported back to that moment in time .
Penguins are very vocal birds and really , really noisy .
And so I expected to walk into this building and be met with this cacophony of honking and braying and squawking , but instead , when we stepped through those doors and into the building , it was eerily silent .
So it was very clear these were stressed , sick , traumatized birds .
The other thing that was so striking was the sheer number of volunteers .
Up to 1,000 people a day came to the rescue center , and eventually , over the course of this rescue , more than 12 and a half thousand volunteers came from all over the world to Cape Town to help save these birds .
And the amazing thing was that not one of them had to be there -- yet they were .
So for the few of us that were there in a professional capacity , this extraordinary volunteer response to this animal crisis was profoundly moving and awe-inspiring .
So the day after we arrived , two of us from the aquarium were put in charge of room two , and room two had more than 4,000 oiled penguins in it .
Now mind you , three days earlier , we had 60 penguins under our care , so we were definitely overwhelmed and just a bit terrified -- at least I was .
Personally , I really didn &apos;t know if I was capable of handling such a monstrous task .
And collectively , we really didn &apos;t know if we could pull this off .
Because we all knew that just six years earlier , half as many penguins had been oiled and rescued and only half of them had survived .
So would it be humanly possible to save this many oiled penguins ?
We just did not know .
But what gave us hope were these incredibly dedicated and brave volunteers -- three of whom here are force-feeding penguins .
And you may notice they &apos;re wearing very thick gloves .
And what you should know about African penguins is that they have razor-sharp beaks .
And before long , our bodies were covered head to toe with these nasty wounds inflicted by the terrified penguins .
Now the day after we arrived , a new crisis began to unfold .
The oil slick was now moving north towards Dassen Island , and the rescuers despaired , because they knew if the oil hit , it would not be possible to rescue any more oiled birds .
And there really were no good solutions .
But then finally , one of the researchers threw out this crazy idea .
He said , &quot; Okay , why don &apos;t we try and collect the birds at the greatest risk of getting oiled &quot; -- they collected 20,000 -- &quot; and we &apos;ll ship them 500 miles up the coast to Port Elizabeth in these open air trucks and release them into the clean waters there and let them swim back home . &quot;
So three of those penguins -- Peter , Pamela and Percy -- wore satellite tags , and the researchers crossed their fingers and hoped that by the time they got back home , the oil would be cleaned up from their islands .
And luckily , the day they arrived , it was .
So it had been a huge gamble , but it had paid off .
And so they know now that they can use this strategy in future oil spills .
So in wildlife rescue , as in life , we learn from each previous experience , and we learn from both our successes and our failures .
And the main thing learned during the Apollo Sea rescue in &apos; 94 was that most of those penguins had died due to the unwitting use of poorly ventilated transport boxes and trucks -- because they just had not been prepared to deal with so many oiled penguins at once .
So in these six years between these two oil spills , they built thousands of these well-ventilated boxes , and as a result , during the Treasure rescue , just 160 penguins died during the transport process , as opposed to 5,000 .
So this alone was a huge victory .
Something else learned during the Apollo rescue was how to train the penguins to take fish freely from their hands , using these training boxes .
And we used this technique again during the Treasure rescue .
But an interesting thing was noted during the training process .
The first penguins to make that transition to free feeding were the ones that had a metal band on their wing from the Apollo Sea spill six years earlier .
So penguins learn from previous experience , too .
So all of those penguins had to have the oil meticulously cleaned from their bodies .
And it would take two people at least an hour just to clean one penguin .
And when you clean a penguin , you first have to spray it with a degreaser .
And this brings me to my favorite story from the Treasure rescue .
About a year prior to this oil spill , a 17 year-old student had invented a degreaser .
And they &apos;d been using it at SANCCOB with great success , so they began using it during the Treasure rescue .
But part way through , they ran out .
So in a panic , Estelle from SANCCOB called the student and said , &quot; Please , you have to make more . &quot;
So he raced to the lab and made enough to clean the rest of the birds .
So I just think it is the coolest thing that a teenager invented a product that helped save the lives of thousands of animals .
So what happened to those 20,000 oiled penguins ?
And was Silvia Gaus right ?
Should we routinely euthanize all oiled birds because most of them are going to die anyway ?
Well she could not be more wrong .
After half a million hours of grueling volunteer labor , more than 90 percent of those oiled penguins were successfully returned to the wild .
And we know from follow-up studies that they have lived just as long as never-oiled penguins , and bred nearly as successfully .
And in addition , about 3,000 penguin chicks were rescued and hand-raised .
And again , we know from long-term monitoring that more of these hand-raised chicks survive to adulthood and breeding age than do parent-raised chicks .
So , armed with this knowledge , SANCCOB has a chick-bolstering project .
And every year they rescue and raise abandoned chicks , and they have a very impressive 80 percent success rate .
And this is critically important because , one year ago , the African penguin was declared endangered .
And they could be extinct in less than 10 years , if we don &apos;t do something now to protect them .
So what did I learn from this intense and unforgettable experience ?
Personally , I learned that I am capable of handling so much more than I ever dreamed possible .
And I learned that one person can make a huge difference .
Just look at that 17 year-old .
And when we come together and work as one , we can achieve extraordinary things .
And truly , to be a part of something so much larger than yourself is the most rewarding experience you can possibly have .
So I &apos;d like to leave you with one final thought and a challenge , if you will .
My mission as the penguin lady is to raise awareness and funding to protect penguins , but why should any of you care about penguins ?
Well , you should care because they &apos;re an indicator species .
And simply put , if penguins are dying , it means our oceans are dying , and we ultimately will be affected , because , as Sylvia Earle says , &quot; The oceans are our life-support system . &quot;
And the two main threats to penguins today are overfishing and global warming .
And these are two things that each one of us actually has the power to do something about .
So if we each do our part , together , we can make a difference , and we can help keep penguins from going extinct .
Humans have always been the greatest threat to penguins , but we are now their only hope .
Thank you .

What you have here is an electronic cigarette .
It &apos;s something that &apos;s , since it was invented a year or two ago , has given me untold happiness .
A little bit of it , I think , is the nicotine , but there &apos;s something much bigger than that .
Which is ever since , in the U.K. , they banned smoking in public places , I &apos;ve never enjoyed a drinks party ever again .
And the reason , I only worked out just the other day , which is when you go to a drinks party and you stand up and you hold a glass of red wine and you talk endlessly to people , you don &apos;t actually want to spend all the time talking .
It &apos;s really , really tiring .
Sometimes you just want to stand there silently , alone with your thoughts .
Sometimes you just want to stand in the corner and stare out of the window .
Now the problem is , when you can &apos;t smoke , if you stand and stare out of the window on your own , you &apos;re an antisocial , friendless idiot .
If you stand and stare out of the window on your own with a cigarette , you &apos;re a fucking philosopher .
So the power of reframing things cannot be overstated .
What we have is exactly the same thing , the same activity , but one of them makes you feel great and the other one , with just a small change of posture , makes you feel terrible .
And I think one of the problems with classical economics is it &apos;s absolutely preoccupied with reality .
And reality isn &apos;t a particularly good guide to human happiness .
Why , for example , are pensioners much happier than the young unemployed ?
Both of them , after all , are in exactly the same stage of life .
You both have too much time on your hands and not much money .
But pensioners are reportedly very , very happy , whereas the unemployed are extraordinarily unhappy and depressed .
The reason , I think , is that the pensioners believe they &apos;ve chosen to be pensioners , whereas the young unemployed feel it &apos;s been thrust upon them .
In England the upper middle classes have actually solved this problem perfectly , because they &apos;ve re-branded unemployment .
If you &apos;re an upper-middle-class English person , you call unemployment &quot; a year off . &quot;
And that &apos;s because having a son who &apos;s unemployed in Manchester is really quite embarrassing , but having a son who &apos;s unemployed in Thailand is really viewed as quite an accomplishment .
But actually the power to re-brand things -- to understand that actually our experiences , costs , things don &apos;t actually much depend on what they really are , but on how we view them -- I genuinely think can &apos;t be overstated .
There &apos;s an experiment I think Daniel Pink refers to where you put two dogs in a box and the box has an electric floor .
Every now and then an electric shock is applied to the floor , which pains the dogs .
The only difference is one of the dogs has a small button in its half of the box .
And when it nuzzles the button , the electric shock stops .
The other dog doesn &apos;t have the button .
It &apos;s exposed to exactly the same level of pain as the dog in the first box , but it has no control over the circumstances .
Generally the first dog can be relatively content .
The second dog lapses into complete depression .
The circumstances of our lives may actually matter less to our happiness than the sense of control we feel over our lives .
It &apos;s an interesting question .
We ask the question -- the whole debate in the Western world is about the level of taxation .
But I think there &apos;s another debate to be asked , which is the level of control we have over our tax money .
That what costs us 10 pounds in one context can be a curse .
What costs us 10 pounds in a different context we may actually welcome .
You know , pay 20,000 pounds in tax toward health and you &apos;re merely feeling a mug .
Pay 20,000 pounds to endow a hospital ward and you &apos;re called a philanthropist .
I &apos;m probably in the wrong country to talk about willingness to pay tax .
So I &apos;ll give you one in return . How you frame things really matters .
Do you call it the bailout of Greece or the bailout of a load of stupid banks which lent to Greece ?
Because they are actually the same thing .
What you call them actually affects how you react to them , viscerally and morally .
I think psychological value is great to be absolutely honest .
One of my great friends , a professor called Nick Chater , who &apos;s the Professor of Decision Sciences in London , believes that we should spend far less time looking into humanity &apos;s hidden depths and spend much more time exploring the hidden shallows .
I think that &apos;s true actually .
I think impressions have an insane effect on what we think and what we do .
But what we don &apos;t have is a really good model of human psychology .
At least pre-Kahneman perhaps , we didn &apos;t have a really good model of human psychology to put alongside models of engineering , of neoclassical economics .
So people who believed in psychological solutions didn &apos;t have a model .
We didn &apos;t have a framework .
This is what Warren Buffett &apos;s business partner Charlie Munger calls &quot; a latticework on which to hang your ideas . &quot;
Engineers , economists , classical economists all had a very , very robust existing latticework on which practically every idea could be hung .
We merely have a collection of random individual insights without an overall model .
And what that means is that in looking at solutions , we &apos;ve probably given too much priority to what I call technical engineering solutions , Newtonian solutions , and not nearly enough to the psychological ones .
You know my example of the Eurostar .
Six million pounds spent to reduce the journey time between Paris and London by about 40 minutes .
For 0.01 percent of this money you could have put WiFi on the trains , which wouldn &apos;t have reduced the duration of the journey , but would have improved its enjoyment and its usefullness far more .
For maybe 10 percent of the money , you could have paid all of the world &apos;s top male and female supermodels to walk up and down the train handing out free Chateau Petrus to all the passengers .
You &apos;d still have five &#91; million &#93; pounds in change , and people would ask for the trains to be slowed down .
Why were we not given the chance to solve that problem psychologically ?
I think it &apos;s because there &apos;s an imbalance , an asymmetry , in the way we treat creative , emotionally-driven psychological ideas versus the way we treat rational , numerical , spreadsheet-driven ideas .
If you &apos;re a creative person , I think quite rightly , you have to share all your ideas for approval with people much more rational than you .
You have to go in and you have to have a cost-benefit analysis , a feasibility study , an ROI study and so forth .
And I think that &apos;s probably right .
But this does not apply the other way around .
People who have an existing framework , an economic framework , an engineering framework , feel that actually logic is its own answer .
What they don &apos;t say is , &quot; Well the numbers all seem to add up , but before I present this idea , I &apos;ll go and show it to some really crazy people to see if they can come up with something better . &quot;
And so we , artificially I think , prioritize what I &apos;d call mechanistic ideas over psychological ideas .
An example of a great psychological idea : The single best improvement in passenger satisfaction on the London Underground per pound spent came when they didn &apos;t add any extra trains nor change the frequency of the trains , they put dot matrix display board on the platforms .
Because the nature of a wait is not just dependent on its numerical quality , its duration , but on the level of uncertainty you experience during that wait .
Waiting seven minutes for a train with a countdown clock is less frustrating and irritating than waiting four minutes , knuckle-biting going , &quot; When &apos;s this train going to damn well arrive ? &quot;
Here &apos;s a beautiful example of a psychological solution deployed in Korea .
Red traffic lights have a countdown delay .
It &apos;s proven to reduce the accident rate in experiments .
Why ? Because road rage , impatience and general irritation are massively reduced when you can actually see the time you have to wait .
In China , not really understanding the principle behind this , they applied the same principle to green traffic lights .
Which isn &apos;t a great idea .
You &apos;re 200 yards away , you realize you &apos;ve got five seconds to go , you floor it .
The Koreans , very assiduously , did test both .
The accident rate goes down when you apply this to red traffic lights ; it goes up when you apply it to green traffic lights .
This is all I &apos;m asking for really in human decision making , is the consideration of these three things .
I &apos;m not asking for the complete primacy of one over the other .
I &apos;m merely saying that when you solve problems , you should look at all three of these equally and you should seek as far as possible to find solutions which sit in the sweet spot in the middle .
If you actually look at a great business , you &apos;ll nearly always see all of these three things coming into play .
Really , really successful businesses -- Google is great , great technological success , but it &apos;s also based on a very good psychological insight : People believe something that only does one thing is better at that thing than something that does that thing and something else .
It &apos;s an innate thing called goal dilution .
Ayelet Fishbach has written a paper about this .
Everybody else at the time of Google , more or less , was trying to be a portal .
Yes , there &apos;s a search function , but you also have weather , sports scores , bits of news .
Google understood that if you &apos;re just a search engine , people assume you &apos;re a very , very good search engine .
All of you know this actually from when you go in to buy a television .
And in the shabbier end of the row of flat screen TVs you can see are these rather despised things called combined TV and DVD players .
And we have no knowledge whatsoever of the quality of those things , but we look at a combined TV and DVD player and we go , &quot; Uck .
It &apos;s probably a bit of a crap telly and a bit rubbish as a DVD player . &quot;
So we walk out of the shops with one of each .
Google is as much a psychological success as it is a technological one .
I propose that we can use psychology to solve problems that we didn &apos;t even realize were problems at all .
This is my suggestion for getting people to finish their course of antibiotics .
Don &apos;t give them 24 white pills .
Give them 18 white pills and six blue ones and tell them to take the white pills first and then take the blue ones .
It &apos;s called chunking .
The likelihood that people will get to the end is much greater when there is a milestone somewhere in the middle .
One of the great mistakes , I think , of economics is it fails to understand that what something is , whether it &apos;s retirement , unemployment , cost , is a function , not only of its amount , but also its meaning .
This is a toll crossing in Britain .
Quite often queues happen at the tolls .
Sometimes you get very , very severe queues .
You could apply the same principle actually , if you like , to the security lanes in airports .
What would happen if you could actually pay twice as much money to cross the bridge , but go through a lane that &apos;s an express lane ?
It &apos;s not an unreasonable thing to do . It &apos;s an economically efficient thing to do .
Time means more to some people than others .
If you &apos;re waiting trying to get to a job interview , you &apos;d patently pay a couple of pounds more to go through the fast lane .
If you &apos;re on the way to visit your mother in-law , you &apos;d probably prefer to stay on the left .
The only problem is if you introduce this economically efficient solution , people hate it .
Because they think you &apos;re deliberately creating delays at the bridge in order to maximize your revenue , and &quot; Why on earth should I pay to subsidize your imcompetence ? &quot;
On the other hand , change the frame slightly and create charitable yield management , so the extra money you get goes not to the bridge company , it goes to charity , and the mental willingness to pay completely changes .
You have a relatively economically efficient solution , but one that actually meets with public approval and even a small degree of affection , rather than being seen as bastardy .
So where economists make the fundamental mistake is they think that money is money .
Actually my pain experienced in paying five pounds is not just proportionate to the amount , but where I think that money is going .
And I think understanding that could revolutionize tax policy .
It could revolutionize the public services .
It could really change things quite significantly .
Here &apos;s a guy you all need to study .
He &apos;s an Austrian school economist who was first active in the first half of the 20th century in Vienna .
What was interesting about the Austrian school is they actually grew up alongside Freud .
And so they &apos;re predominantly interested in psychology .
They believed that there was a discipline called praxeology , which is a prior discipline to the study of economics .
Praxeology is the study of human choice , action and decision making .
I think they &apos;re right .
I think the danger we have in today &apos;s world is we have the study of economics considers itself to be a prior discipline to the study of human psychology .
But as Charlie Munger says , &quot; If economics isn &apos;t behavioral , I don &apos;t know what the hell is . &quot;
Von Mises , interestingly , believes economics is just a subset of psychology .
I think he just refers to economics as &quot; the study of human praxeology under conditions of scarcity . &quot;
But von Mises , among many other things , I think uses an analogy which is probably the best justification and explanation for the value of marketing , the value of perceived value and the fact that we should actually treat it as being absolutely equivalent to any other kind of value .
We tend to , all of us -- even those of us who work in marketing -- to think of value in two ways .
There &apos;s the real value , which is when you make something in a factory and provide a service , and then there &apos;s a kind of dubious value , which you create by changing the way people look at things .
Von Mises completely rejected this distinction .
And he used this following analogy .
He referred actually to strange economists called the French Physiocrats , who believed that the only true value was what you extracted from the land .
So if you &apos;re a shepherd or a quarryman or a farmer , you created true value .
If however , you bought some wool from the shepherd and charged a premium for converting it into a hat , you weren &apos;t actually creating value , you were exploiting the shepherd .
Now von Mises said that modern economists make exactly the same mistake with regard to advertising and marketing .
He says , if you run a restaurant , there is no healthy distinction to be made between the value you create by cooking the food and the value you create by sweeping the floor .
One of them creates , perhaps , the primary product -- the thing we think we &apos;re paying for -- the other one creates a context within which we can enjoy and appreciate that product .
And the idea that one of them should actually have priority over the other is fundamentally wrong .
Try this quick thought experiment .
Imagine a restaurant that serves Michelin-starred food , but actually where the restaurant smells of sewage and there &apos;s human feces on the floor .
The best thing you can do there to create value is not actually to improve the food still further , it &apos;s to get rid of the smell and clean up the floor .
And it &apos;s vital we understand this .
If that seems like some strange , abstruse thing , in the U.K. , the post office had a 98 percent success rate at delivering first-class mail the next day .
They decided this wasn &apos;t good enough and they wanted to get it up to 99 .
The effort to do that almost broke the organization .
If at the same time you &apos;d gone and asked people , &quot; What percentage of first-class mail arrives the next day ? &quot;
the average answer , or the modal answer would have been 50 to 60 percent .
Now if your perception is much worse than your reality , what on earth are you doing trying to change the reality ?
That &apos;s like trying to improve the food in a restaurant that stinks .
What you need to do is first of all tell people that 98 percent of mail gets there the next day , first-class mail .
That &apos;s pretty good .
I would argue , in Britain there &apos;s a much better frame of reference , which is to tell people that more first-class mail arrives the next day in the U.K. than in Germany .
Because generally in Britain if you want to make us happy about something , just tell us we do it better than the Germans .
Choose your frame of reference and the perceived value and therefore the actual value is completely tranformed .
It has to be said of the Germans that the Germans and the French are doing a brilliant job of creating a united Europe .
The only thing they don &apos;t expect is they &apos;re uniting Europe through a shared mild hatred of the French and Germans .
But I &apos;m British , that &apos;s the way we like it .
What you also notice is that in any case our perception is leaky .
We can &apos;t tell the difference between the quality of the food and the environment in which we consume it .
All of you will have seen this phenomenon if you have your car washed or valeted .
When you drive away , your car feels as if it drives better .
And the reason for this , unless my car valet mysteriously is changing the oil and performing work which I &apos;m not paying him for and I &apos;m unaware of , is because perception is in any case leaky .
Analgesics that are branded are more effective at reducing pain than analgesics that are not branded .
I don &apos;t just mean through reported pain reduction , actual measured pain reduction .
And so perception actually is leaky in any case .
So if you do something that &apos;s perceptually bad in one respect , you can damage the other .
Thank you very much .

Every presentation needs this slide in it .
It &apos;s beautiful , isn &apos;t it ?
Do you see ?
All the points , all the lines -- it &apos;s incredible .
It is the network ; and in my case , the network has been important in media , because I get to connect to people .
Isn &apos;t it amazing ?
Through that , I connect to people .
And the way that I &apos;ve been doing it has been multifaceted .
For example , I get people to dress up their vacuum cleaners .
I put together projects like Earth Sandwich , where I ask people to try and simultaneously place two pieces of bread perfectly opposite each other on the Earth .
And people started laying bread in tribute , and eventually a team was able to do it between New Zealand and Spain .
It &apos;s pretty incredible -- the video &apos;s online .
Connecting to people in projects like YoungmeNowme for example .
In YoungmeNowme , the audience was asked to find a childhood photograph of themselves and restage it as an adult .
This is the same person -- top photo , James , bottom photo , &#91; Jennifer &#93; .
Poignant .
This was a Mother &apos;s Day gift .
Particularly creepy .
My favorite of these photos , which I couldn &apos;t find , is there &apos;s a picture of a 30 year-old woman or so with a little baby on her lap , and the next photo is a 220-lb man with a tiny , little old lady peaking over his shoulder .
But this project changed the way that I thought about connecting to people .
This is project called Ray .
And what happened was I was sent this piece of audio and had no idea who generated the audio .
Somebody said , &quot; You have to listen to this . &quot;
And this is what came to me .
Recording : Hi , my name is Ray , and on yesterday my daughter called me because she was stressed out because of things that were going on on her job that she felt was quite unfair .
Being quite disturbed , she called for comfort , and I didn &apos;t really know what to tell her , because we have to deal with so much mess in our society .
So I was led to write this song just for her , just to give her some encouragement while dealing with stress and pressures on her job .
And I figured I &apos;d put it on the Internet for all employees under stress to help you better deal with what you &apos;re going through on your job .
Here &apos;s how the song goes .
I &apos;m about to whip somebody &apos;s ass Oh , I &apos;m about to whip somebody &apos;s ass Oh , if you don &apos;t leave me alone , you gonna have to send me home &apos; Cause I &apos;m about to whip somebody &apos;s ass Now you might not be able to sing that out loud , but you can hum it to yourself , and you know what the words are .
And let it give you some strength to get the next few moments on your job .
All right . Stay strong . Peace .
Ze Frank : So -- yeah .
No , no , no , shush . We &apos;ve got to go quickly .
So I was so moved by this -- this is incredible . This was connecting , right .
This was , at a distance , realizing that someone was feeling something , wanting to affect them in a particular way , using media to do it , putting it online and realizing that there was a greater impact .
This was incredible ; this is what I wanted to do .
So the first thing I thought of is we have to thank him .
And I asked my audience , I said , &quot; Listen to this piece of audio .
We have to remix it . He &apos;s got a great voice .
It &apos;s actually in the key of B flat .
And have to do something with it . &quot;
Hundreds of remixes came back -- lots of different attempts .
One stood out in particular .
It was done by a guy named Goose .
Remix : I &apos;m about to whip somebody &apos;s ass Oh , I &apos;m about to whip somebody &apos;s ass Oh , if you don &apos;t leave me alone , You gonna have to send me home Cuz I &apos;m about to whip somebody &apos;s ass I &apos;m about to whip some -- ZF : Great , so it was incredible .
That song -- Thank you .
So that song , somebody told me that it was at a baseball game in Kansas City .
In the end , it was one of the top downloads on a whole bunch of music streaming services .
And so I said , &quot; Let &apos;s put this together in an album . &quot;
And the audience came together , and they designed an album cover .
And I said , &quot; If you put it all on this , I &apos;m going to deliver it to him , if you can figure out who this person is , &quot; because all I had was his name -- Ray -- and this little piece of audio and the fact that his daughter was upset .
In two weeks , they found him .
I received and email and it said , &quot; Hi , I &apos;m Ray .
I heard you were looking for me . &quot;
And I was like , &quot; Yeah , Ray .
It &apos;s been an interesting two weeks . &quot;
And so I flew to St. Louis and met Ray , and he &apos;s a preacher -- among other things .
So but anyways , here &apos;s the thing -- is it reminds me of this , which is a sign that you see in Amsterdam on every street corner .
And it &apos;s sort of a metaphor for me for the virtual world .
I look at this photo , and he seems really interested in what &apos;s going on with that button , but it doesn &apos;t seem like he is really that interested in crossing the street .
And it makes me think of this .
On street corners everywhere , people are looking at their cell phones , and it &apos;s easy to dismiss this as some sort of bad trend in human culture .
But the truth is life is being lived there .
When they smile -- right , you &apos;ve seen people stop -- all of a sudden , life is being lived there , somewhere up in that weird , dense network .
And this is it , right , to feel and be felt .
It &apos;s the fundamental force that we &apos;re all after .
We can build all sorts of environments to make it a little bit easier , but ultimately , what we &apos;re trying to do is really connect with one other person .
And that &apos;s not always going to happen in physical spaces .
It &apos;s also going to now happen in virtual spaces , and we have to get better at figuring that out .
I think , of the people that build all this technology in the network , a lot of them aren &apos;t very good at connecting with people .
This is kind of like something I used to do in third grade .
So here &apos;s a series of projects over the last few years where I &apos;ve been inspired by trying to figure out how to really facilitate close connection .
Sometimes they &apos;re very , very simple things .
A Childhood Walk , which is a project where I ask people to remember a walk that they used to take as a child over and over again that was sort of meaningless -- like on the route to the bus stop , to a neighbor &apos;s house , and take it inside of Google Streetview .
And I promise you , if you take that walk inside Google Streetview , you come to a moment where something comes back and hits you in the face .
And I collected those moments -- the photos inside Google Streetview and the memories , specifically .
&quot; Our conversation started with me saying , &apos; I &apos;m bored , &apos; and her replying , &apos; When I &apos;m bored I eat pretzels . &apos; I remember this distinctly because it came up a lot . &quot;
&quot; Right after he told me and my brother he was going to be separating from my mom , I remember walking to a convenience store and getting a cherry cola . &quot;
&quot; They used some of the morbidly artist footage , a close-up of Chad &apos;s shoes in the middle of the highway .
I guess the shoes came off when he was hit .
He slept over at my house once , and he left his pillow .
It had &apos; Chad &apos; written in magic marker on it .
He died long after he left the pillow at my house , but we never got around to returning it . &quot;
Sometimes they &apos;re a little bit more abstract .
This is Pain Pack .
Right after September 11th , last year , I was thinking about pain and the way that we disperse it , the way that we excise it from our bodies .
So what I did is I opened up a hotline -- a hotline where people could leave voicemails of their pain , not necessarily related to that event .
And people called in and left messages like this .
Recording : Okay , here &apos;s something .
I &apos;m not alone , and I am loved .
I &apos;m really fortunate .
But sometimes I feel really lonely .
And when I feel that way even the smallest act of kindness can make me cry .
Like even people in convenience stores saying , &quot; Have a nice day , &quot; when they &apos;re accidentally looking me in the eye .
ZF : So what I did was I took those voicemails , and with their permission , converted them to MP3s and distributed them to sound editors who created short sounds using just those voicemails .
And those were then distributed to DJs who have made hundreds of songs using that source material .
We don &apos;t have time to play much of it .
You can look at it online .
&quot; From 52 to 48 with love &quot; was a project around the time of the last election cycle , where McCain and Obama both , in their speeches after the election , talked about reconciliation , and I was like , &quot; What the hell does that look like ? &quot;
So I thought , &quot; Well let &apos;s just give it a try .
Let &apos;s have people hold up signs about reconciliation . &quot;
And so some really nice things came together .
&quot; I voted blue . I voted red .
Together , for our future . &quot;
These are very , very cute little things right .
Some came from the winning party .
&quot; Dear 48 , I promise to listen to you , to fight for you , to respect you always . &quot;
Some came from the party who had just lost .
&quot; From a 48 to a 52 , may your party &apos;s leadership be as classy as you , but I doubt it . &quot;
But the truth was that as this start becoming popular , a couple rightwing blogs and some message boards apparently found it to be a little patronizing , which I could also see .
And so I started getting amazing amounts of hate mail , death threats even .
And one guy in particular kept on writing me these pretty awful messages , and he was dressed as Batman .
And he said , &quot; I &apos;m dressed as Batman to hide my identity . &quot;
Just in case I thought the real Batman was coming after me ; which actually made me feel a little better -- like , &quot; Phew , it &apos;s not him . &quot;
So what I did -- unfortunately , I was harboring all this kind of awful experience and this pain inside of me , and it started to eat away at my psyche .
And I was protecting the project from it , I realized . I was protecting it -- I didn &apos;t want this special , little group of photographs to get sullied in some way .
So what I did , I took all those emails , and I put them together into something called Angrigami , which was an origami template made out of this sort of vile stuff .
And I asked people to send me beautiful things made out of the Angrigami .
But this was the emotional moment .
One of my viewer &apos;s uncles died on a particular day and he chose to commemorate it with a piece of hate .
It &apos;s amazing .
The last thing I &apos;m going to tell you about is a series of projects called Songs You Already Know , where the idea was , I was trying to figure out to address particular kinds of emotions with group projects .
So one of them was fairly straightforward .
A guy said that his daughter got scared at night and could I write a song for her , his daughter .
And I said , &quot; Oh yeah , I &apos;ll try to write a mantra that she can sing to herself to help herself go to sleep . &quot;
And this was &quot; Scared . &quot;
This is a song that I sing when I &apos;m scared of something I don &apos;t know why but it helps me get over it The words of the song just move me along And somehow I get over it At least I don &apos;t suck at life I keep on trying despite At least I don &apos;t suck at life I keep on trying despite This is a song that I sing when I &apos;m scared of something Okay , so I wrote that song , right . Thank you .
So the nice thing was is he walked by his daughter &apos;s room at some point , and she actually was singing that song to herself .
So I was like , &quot; Awesome . This is great . &quot;
And then I got this email . And there &apos;s a little bit of a back story to this .
And I don &apos;t have much time .
But the idea was that at one point I did a project called Facebook Me Equals You , where I wanted to experience what it was like to live as another person .
So I asked for people &apos;s usernames and passwords to be sent to me .
And I got a lot , like 30 in a half an hour .
And I shut that part down .
And I chose two people to be , and I asked them to send me descriptions of how to act as them on Facebook .
One person sent me a very detailed description ; the other person didn &apos;t .
And the person who didn &apos;t , it turned out , had just moved to a new city and taken on a new job .
So , you know , people were writing me and saying , &quot; How &apos;s your new job ? &quot;
I was like , &quot; I don &apos;t know .
Didn &apos;t know I had one . &quot;
But anyway , this same person , Laura , ended up emailing me a little bit after that project .
And I felt badly for not having done a good job .
And she said , &quot; I &apos;m really anxious , I just moved to a new town , I have this new job , and I &apos;ve just had this incredible amount of anxiety . &quot;
So she had seen the &quot; Scared &quot; song and wondered if I could do something .
So I asked her , &quot; What does it feel like when you feel this way ? &quot;
And she wrote a sort of descriptive set of what it felt like to have had this anxiety .
And so what I decided to do .
I said , &quot; Okay , I &apos;ll think about it . &quot;
And so quietly in the background , I started sending people this .
Hey You &apos;re okay You &apos;ll be fine So I asked people whether they had basic audio capabilities , just so they could sing along to the song with headphones on , so I could just get their voices back .
And this is the kind of thing that I got back .
Recording : Hey You &apos;re okay You &apos;ll be fine ZF : So that &apos;s one of the better ones , really .
But what &apos;s awesome is , as I started getting more and more and more of them , all of a sudden I had 30 , 40 voices from around the world .
And when you put them together , something magical happens , something absolutely incredible happens , and all of a sudden I get a chorus from around the world .
And what was really great is , I &apos;m putting all this work together in the background , and Laura sent me a follow-up email because a good month had passed by .
And she said , &quot; I know you &apos;ve forgotten about me .
I just want to say thanks for even considering it . &quot;
And then a few days later I sent her this .
Right now , it feels like I forgot to turn the light on And things that looked so good yesterday are now shades of gray And it seems like the world is spinning while I &apos;m standing still Or maybe I am spinning I can &apos;t tell And then you say Hey You &apos;re okay You &apos;ll be fine Just breathe And now the words sing Hey You &apos;re okay You &apos;ll be fine Just breathe Now everybody sings Hey You &apos;re okay You &apos;ll be fine Just breathe Hey You &apos;re okay You &apos;ll be fine Just breathe Hey You &apos;re okay You &apos;ll be fine Just breathe Thank you .

Tyler Dewar : The way I feel right now is that all of the other speakers have said exactly what I wanted to say .
And it seems that the only thing left for me to say is to thank you all for your kindness .
TD : But maybe in the spirit of appreciating the kindness of you all , I could share with you a little story about myself .
TD : From the time I was very young , onward , I was given a lot of different responsibilities , and it always seemed to me , when I was young , that everything was laid out before me .
All of the plans for me were already made .
I was given the clothes that I needed to wear and told where I needed to be , given these very precious and holy looking robes to wear , with the understanding that it was something sacred or important .
TD : But before that kind of formal lifestyle happened for me , I was living in eastern Tibet with my family .
And when I was seven years old , all of a sudden , a search party arrived at my home .
They were looking the next Karmapa , and I noticed they were talking to my mom and dad , and the news came to me that they were telling me that I was the Karmapa .
And these days , people ask me a lot , how did that feel .
How did that feel when they came and whisked you away , and your lifestyle completely changed ?
And what I mostly say is that , at that time , it was a pretty interesting idea to me .
I thought that things would be pretty fun and there would be more things to play with .
TD : But it didn &apos;t turn out to be so fun and entertaining , as I thought it would have been .
I was placed in a pretty strictly controlled environment .
And immediately , a lot of different responsibilities , in terms of my education and so forth , were heaped upon me .
I was separated , largely , from my family , including my mother and father .
I didn &apos;t have have many personal friends to spend time with , but I was expected to perform these prescribed duties .
So it turned out that my fantasy about an entertaining life of being the Karmapa wasn &apos;t going to come true .
It more felt to be the case to me that I was being treated like a statue , and I was to sit in one place like a statue would .
TD : Nevertheless , I felt that , even though I &apos;ve been separated from my loved ones -- and , of course , now I &apos;m even further away .
When I was 14 , I escaped from Tibet and became even further removed from my mother and father , my relatives , my friends and my homeland .
But nevertheless , there &apos;s no real sense of separation from me in my heart , in terms of the love that I feel for these people .
I feel , still , a very strong connection of love for all of these people and for the land .
TD : And I still do get to keep in touch with my mother and father , albeit infrequently .
I talk to my mother once in a blue moon on the telephone .
And my experience is that , when I &apos;m talking to her , with every second that passes during our conversation , the feeling of love that binds us is bringing us closer and closer together .
TD : So those were just a few remarks about my personal background .
And in terms of other things that I wanted to share with you , in terms of ideas , I think it &apos;s wonderful to have a situation like this , where so many people from different backgrounds and places can come together , exchange their ideas and form relationships of friendship with each other .
And I think that &apos;s symbolic of what we &apos;re seeing in the world in general , that the world is becoming smaller and smaller , and that all of the peoples in the world are enjoying more opportunities for connection .
That &apos;s wonderful , but we should also remember that we should have a similar process happening on the inside .
Along with outward development and increase of opportunity , there should be inward development and deepening of our heart connections as well as our outward connections .
So we spoke and we heard some about design this week .
I think that it &apos;s important for us to remember that we need to keep pushing forward on the endeavor of the design of the heart .
We heard a lot about technology this week , and it &apos;s important for us to remember to invest a lot of our energy in improving the technology of the heart .
TD : So , even though I &apos;m somewhat happy about the wonderful developments that are happening in the world , still , I feel a sense of impediment , when it comes to the ability that we have to connect with each other on a heart-to-heart , or a mind-to-mind , level .
I feel that there are some things that are getting in the way .
TC : My relationship to this concept of heart-to-heart connection , or mind-to-mind connection , is an interesting one , because , as a spiritual leader , I &apos;m always attempting to open my heart to others and offer myself up for heart-to-heart and mind-to-mind connections in a genuine way with other people , but at the same time , I &apos;ve always been advised that I need to emphasize intelligence over the heart-to-heart connections , because , being someone in a position like mine , if I don &apos;t rely primarily on intelligence , then something dangerous may happen to me .
So it &apos;s an interesting paradox at play there .
But I had a really striking experience once , when a group from Afghanistan came to visit me , and we had a really interesting conversation .
TD : So we ended up talking about the Bamiyan Buddhas , which , as you know , were destroyed some years ago in Afghanistan .
But the basis of our conversation was the different approach to spirituality on the part of the Muslim and Buddhist traditions .
Of course , in Muslim , because of the teachings around the concept of idolatry , you don &apos;t find as many physical representations of divinity or of spiritual liberation as you do in the Buddhist tradition , where , of course , there are many statues of the Buddha that are highly revered .
So , we were talking about the differences between the traditions and what many people perceived as the tragedy of the destruction of the Bamiyan Buddhas , but I offered the suggestion that perhaps we could look at this in a positive way .
What we saw in the destruction of the Bamiyan Buddhas was the depletion of matter , some solid substance falling down and disintegrating .
Maybe we could look at that to be more similar to the falling of the Berlin Wall , where a divide that had kept two types of people apart had collapsed and opened up a door for further communication .
So I think that , in this way , it &apos;s always possible for us to derive something positive that can help us understand one another better .
TD : So , with regard to the development that we &apos;ve been talking about here at this conference , I really feel that the development that we make shouldn &apos;t create a further burden for us as human beings , but should be used to improve our fundamental lifestyle of how we live in the world .
TD : Of course , I rejoice in the development and the growth and the rise of the noble land of India , the great country of India , but at the same time , I think , as some of us have acknowledged , we need to be aware that some aspects of this rise are coming at the cost of the very ground on which we stand .
So , as we are climbing the tree , some of the things that we &apos;re doing in order to climb the tree are actually undermining the tree &apos;s very root .
And so , what I think it comes down to is a question of , not only having information of what &apos;s going on , but paying attention to that and letting that shift our motivation to become more sincere and genuinely positive .
We have hear , this week , about the horrible sufferings , for example , that so many women of the world are enduring day-to-day .
We have that information , but what often happens to us is that we don &apos;t really choose to pay attention to it .
We don &apos;t really choose to allow that to cause there to be a shift in our hearts .
So I think the way forward for the world -- one that will bring the path of outer development in harmony with the real root of happiness -- is that we allow the information that we have to really make a change in our heart .
TD : So I think that sincere motivation is very important for our future well-being , or deep sense of well-being as humans , and I think that means sinking in to whatever it is you &apos;re doing now .
Whatever work you &apos;re trying to do now to benefit the world , sink into that , get a full taste of that .
TD : So , since we &apos;ve been here this week , we &apos;ve taken millions of breaths , collectively , and perhaps we haven &apos;t witnessed any course changes happening in our lives , but we often miss the very subtle changes .
And I think that sometimes we develop grand concepts of what happiness might look like for us , but that , if we pay attention , we can see that there are little symbols of happiness in every breath that we take .
TD : So , every one of you who has come here is so talented , and you have so much to offer to the world , I think it would be a good note to conclude on then to just take a moment to appreciate how fortunate we are to have come together in this way and exchanged ideas and really form a strong aspiration and energy within ourselves that we will take the good that has come from this conference , the momentum , the positivity , and we will spread that and plant it in all of the corners of the world .
His Holiness the Karmapa : Tomorrow is my Talk .
TD : Lakshmi has worked incredibly hard , even in inviting me , let alone everything else that she has done to make this happen , and I was somewhat resistant at times , and I was also very nervous throughout this week .
I was feeling under the weather and dizzy and so forth , and people would ask me , why .
I would tell them , &quot; It &apos;s because I have to talk tomorrow . &quot;
And so Lakshmi had to put up with me through all of that , but I very much appreciate the opportunity she &apos;s given me to be here .
And to you , everyone , thank you very much .
HH : Thank you very much .

Good afternoon .
There &apos;s a medical revolution happening all around us , and it &apos;s one that &apos;s going to help us conquer some of society &apos;s most dreaded conditions , including cancer .
The revolution is called angiogenesis , and it &apos;s based on the process that our bodies use to grow blood vessels .
So why should we care about blood vessels ?
Well , the human body is literally packed with them : 60,000 miles worth in a typical adult .
End to end , that would form a line that would circle the earth twice .
The smallest blood vessels are called capillaries ; we &apos;ve got 19 billion of them in our bodies .
And these are the vessels of life , and , as I &apos;ll show you , they can also be the vessels of death .
Now the remarkable thing about blood vessels is that they have this ability to adapt to whatever environment they &apos;re growing in .
For example , in the liver they form channels to detoxify the blood ; in the lung they line air sacs for gas exchange ; in muscle they corkscrew so that muscles can contract without cutting off circulation ; and in nerves they course along like power lines , keeping those nerves alive .
We get most of these blood vessels when we &apos;re actually still in the womb , And what that means is that as adults , blood vessels don &apos;t normally grow .
Except in a few special circumstances : In women , blood vessels grow every month to build the lining of the uterus ; during pregnancy , they form the placenta , which connects mom and baby .
And after injury , blood vessels actually have to grow under the scab in order to heal a wound .
And this is actually what it looks like , hundreds of blood vessels all growing toward the center of the wound .
So the body has the ability to regulate the amount of blood vessels that are present at any given time .
It does this through an elaborate and elegant system of checks and balances , stimulators and inhibitors of angiogenesis , such that , when we need a brief burst of blood vessels , the body can do this by releasing stimulators , proteins called angiogenic factors that act as natural fertilizer and stimulate new blood vessels to sprout .
And when those excess vessels are no longer needed , the body prunes them back to baseline using naturally occurring inhibitors of angiogenesis .
Now there are other situations where we start beneath the baseline and we need to grow more blood vessels just to get back to normal levels -- for example , after an injury -- and a body can do that too , but only to that normal level , that set point .
But what we now know is that for a number of diseases , there are defects in the system where the body can &apos;t prune back extra blood vessels or can &apos;t grow enough new ones in the right place at the right time .
And in these situations , angiogenesis is out of balance .
And when angiogenesis is out of balance , a myriad of diseases result .
For example , insufficient angiogenesis -- not enough blood vessels -- leads to wounds that don &apos;t heal , heart attacks , legs without circulation , death from stroke , nerve damage .
And on the other end , excessive angiogenesis -- too many blood vessels -- drives disease , and we see this in cancer , blindness , arthritis , obesity , Alzheimer &apos;s disease .
In total , there are more than 70 major diseases affecting more than a billion people worldwide , that all look on the surface to be different from one another , but all actually share abnormal angiogenesis as their common denominator .
And this realization is allowing us to reconceptualize the way that we actually approach these diseases by controlling angiogenesis .
Now I &apos;m going to focus on cancer because angiogenesis is a hallmark of cancer , every type of cancer .
So here we go .
This is a tumor : dark , gray , ominous mass growing inside a brain .
And under the microscope , you can see hundreds of these brown staining blood vessels , capillaries that are feeding cancer cells , bringing oxygen and nutrients .
But cancers don &apos;t start out like this .
And , in fact , cancers don &apos;t start out with a blood supply .
They start out as small , microscopic nests of cells that can only grow to one half a cubic millimeter in size ; that &apos;s the tip of a ballpoint pen .
Then they can &apos;t get any larger because they don &apos;t have a blood supply , so they don &apos;t have enough oxygen or nutrients .
In fact , we &apos;re probably forming these microscopic cancers all the time in our body .
Autopsy studies from people who died in car accidents have shown that about 40 percent of women between the ages of 40 and 50 actually have microscopic cancers in their breasts , about 50 percent of men in their 50s and 60s have microscopic prostate cancers , and virtually 100 percent of us , by the time we reach our 70s , will have microscopic cancers growing in our thyroid .
Yet , without a blood supply , most of these cancers will never become dangerous .
Dr. Judah Folkman , who was my mentor and who was the pioneer of the angiogenesis field , once called this &quot; cancer without disease . &quot;
So the body &apos;s ability to balance angiogenesis , when it &apos;s working properly , prevents blood vessels from feeding cancers .
And this turns out to be one of our most important defense mechanisms against cancer .
In fact , if you actually block angiogenesis and prevent blood vessels from ever reaching cancer cells , tumors simply can &apos;t grow up .
But once angiogenesis occurs , cancers can grow exponentially .
And this is actually how a cancer goes from being harmless to deadly .
Cancer cells mutate and they gain the ability to release lots of those angiogenic factors , natural fertilizer , that tip the balance in favor of blood vessels invading the cancer .
And once those vessels invade the cancer , it can expand , it can invade local tissues .
And the same vessels that are feeding tumors allow cancer cells to exit into the circulation as metastases .
And , unfortunately , this late stage of cancer is the one at which it &apos;s most likely to be diagnosed , when angiogenesis is already turned on and cancer cells are growing like wild .
So , if angiogenesis is a tipping point between a harmless cancer and a harmful one , then one major part of the angiogenesis revolution is a new approach to treating cancer by cutting off the blood supply .
We call this antiangiogenic therapy , and it &apos;s completely different from chemotherapy because it selectively aims at the blood vessels that are feeding the cancers .
And we can do this because tumor blood vessels are unlike normal , healthy vessels we see in other places of the body : They &apos;re abnormal ; they &apos;re very poorly constructed ; and , because of that , they &apos;re highly vulnerable to treatments that target them .
In effect , when we give cancer patients antiangiogenic therapy -- here , an experimental drug for a glioma , which is a type of brain tumor -- you can see that there are dramatic changes that occur when the tumor is being starved .
Here &apos;s a woman with a breast cancer being treated with the antiangiogenic drug called Avastin , which is FDA approved .
And you can see that the halo of blood flow disappears after treatment .
Well , I &apos;ve just shown you two very different types of cancer that both responded to antiangiogenic therapy .
So , a few years ago , I asked myself , &quot; Can we take this one step further and treat other cancers , even in other species ? &quot;
So here is a nine year-old boxer named Milo who had a very aggressive tumor called a malignant neurofibroma growing on his shoulder .
It invaded into his lungs .
His veterinarian only gave him three months to live .
So we created a cocktail of antiangiogenic drugs that could be mixed into his dog food as well as an antiangiogenic cream that could be applied on the surface of the tumor .
And within a few weeks of treatment , we were able to slow down that cancer &apos;s growth such that we were ultimately able to extend milo &apos;s survival to six times what the veterinarian had initially predicted , all with a very good quality of life .
And we subsequently treated more than 600 dogs .
We have about a 60 percent response rate and improved survival for these pets that were about to be euthanized .
So let me show you a couple of even more interesting examples .
This is 20-year-old dolphin living in Florida , and she had these lesions in her mouth that , over the course of three years , developed into invasive squamous cell cancers .
So we created an antiangiogenic paste .
We had it painted on top of the cancer three times a week .
And over the course of seven months , the cancers completely disappeared , and the biopsies came back as normal .
Here &apos;s a cancer growing on the lip of a Wuarter horse named Guinness .
It &apos;s a very , very deadly type of cancer called an angiosarcoma .
It had already spread to his lymph nodes , so we used an antiangiogenic skin cream for the lip and an oral cocktail , so we could treat from the inside as well as the outside .
And over the course of six months , he experienced a complete remission .
And here he is six years later , Guinness , with his very happy owner .
Now , obviously , antiangiogenic therapy could be used for a wide range of cancers .
And , in fact , the first pioneering treatments for people , as well as dogs , are already becoming available .
There &apos;s 12 different drugs , 11 different cancer types .
But the real question is : How well do these work in practice ?
So here &apos;s actually the patient survival data from eight different types of cancer .
The bars represent survival time taken from the era in which there was only chemotherapy , or surgery , or radiation available .
But starting in 2004 , when antiangiogenic therapies first became available , well you can see that there has been a 70 to 100 percent improvement in survival for people with kidney cancer , multiple myeloma , colorectal cancer , and gastrointestinal stromal tumors .
That &apos;s impressive .
But for other tumors and cancer types , the improvements have only been modest .
So I started asking myself , &quot; Why haven &apos;t we been able to do better ? &quot;
And the answer , to me , is obvious ; we &apos;re treating cancer too late in the game , when it &apos;s already established and , oftentimes , it &apos;s already spread or metastasized .
And as a doctor , I know that once a disease progresses to an advanced stage , achieving a cure can be difficult , if not impossible .
So I went back to the biology of angiogenesis and started thinking : Could the answer to cancer be preventing angiogenesis , beating cancer at its own game so the cancers could never become dangerous ?
This could help healthy people as well as people who &apos;ve already beaten cancer once or twice and want to find a way to keep it from coming back .
So to look for a way to prevent angiogenesis in cancer , I went back to look at cancer &apos;s causes .
And what really intrigued me was when I saw that diet accounts for 30 to 35 percent of environmentally caused cancers .
Now , the obvious thing is to think about what we could remove from our diet , what to strip out , take away .
But I actually took a completely opposite approach and began asking : What could we be adding to our diet that &apos;s naturally antiangiogenic , that could boost the body &apos;s defense system and beat back those blood vessels that are feeding cancers ?
In other words , can we eat to starve cancer ?
Well , the answer &apos;s yes , and I &apos;m going to show you how .
Our search for this has taken us to the market , the farm and to the spice cabinet , because what we &apos;ve discovered is that mother nature has laced a large number of foods and beverages and herbs with naturally occurring inhibitors of angiogenesis .
So here &apos;s a test system we developed .
At the center is a ring from which hundreds of blood vessels are growing out in a starburst fashion .
And we can use this system to test dietary factors at concentrations that are obtainable by eating .
So let me show you what happens when we put in an extract from red grapes .
The active ingredient &apos;s resveratrol , it &apos;s also found in red wine .
This inhibits abnormal angiogenesis by 60 percent .
Here &apos;s what happens when we added an extract from strawberries ; it potently inhibits angiogenesis .
And extract from soybeans .
And here is a growing list of our antiangiogenic foods and beverages that we &apos;re interested in studying .
For each food type , we believe that there are different potencies within different strains and varietals .
And we want to measure this because , well , while you &apos;re eating a strawberry or drinking tea , why not select the one that &apos;s most potent for preventing cancer .
So here are four different teas that we &apos;ve tested .
They &apos;re all common ones : Chinese jasmine , Japanese sencha , Earl Grey and a special blend that we prepared .
And you can see clearly that the teas vary in their potency from less potent to more potent .
But what &apos;s very cool is when we actually combined the two less potent teas together , the combination , the blend , is more potent than either one alone .
This means there &apos;s food synergy .
Here &apos;s some more data from our testing .
Now , in the lab , we can simulate tumor angiogenesis represented here in a black bar .
And using this system , we can test the potency of cancer drugs .
So the shorter the bar , less angiogenesis , that &apos;s good .
And here are some common drugs that have been associated with reducing the risk of cancer in people .
Statins , nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and a few others , they inhibit angiogenesis too .
And here are the dietary factors going head to head against these drugs .
You can see , they clearly hold their own and , in some cases , they &apos;re more potent than the actual drugs .
Soy , parsley , garlic , grapes , berries ; I could go home and cook a tasty meal using these ingredients .
So imagine if we could create the world &apos;s first rating system in which we could score foods according to their antiangiogenic , cancer-preventative properties .
And that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing right now .
Now , I &apos;ve shown you a bunch of lab data , and so the real question is : What is the evidence in people that eating certain foods can reduce angiogenesis in cancer ?
Well , the best example I know is a study of 79,000 men followed over 20 years , in which it was found that men who consumed cooked tomatoes two to three times a week had up to a 50 percent reduction in their risk of developing prostate cancer .
Now , we know that tomatoes are a good source of lycopene , and lycopene is antiangiogenic .
But what &apos;s even more interesting from this study is that in those men who did develop prostate cancer , those who ate more servings of tomato sauce actually had fewer blood vessels feeding their cancer .
So this human study is a prime example of how antiangiogenic substances present in food and consumed at practical levels can impact on cancer .
And we &apos;re now studying the role of a healthy diet with Dean Ornish at UCSF and Tufts University on the role of this healthy diet on markers of angiogenesis that we can find in the bloodstream .
Now , obviously , what I &apos;ve shared with you has some far-ranging implications , even beyond cancer research .
Because if we &apos;re right , it could impact on consumer education , food services , public health and even the insurance industry .
And , in fact , some insurance companies are already beginning to think along these lines .
Check out this ad from Blue Cross Blue Shield of Minnesota .
And for many people around the world , dietary cancer prevention may be the only practical solution because not everybody can afford expensive end-stage cancer treatments , but everybody could benefit from a healthy diet based on local , sustainable , antiangiogenic crops .
Now , finally , I &apos;ve talked to you about food , and I &apos;ve talked to you about cancer , so there &apos;s just one more disease that I have to tell you about and that &apos;s obesity .
Because it turns out that adipose tissue , fat , is highly angiogenesis dependent .
And , like a tumor , fat grows when blood vessels grow .
So the question is : Can we shrink fat by cutting off its blood supply ?
So the top curve shows the body weight of a genetically obese mouse that eats nonstop until it turns fat , like this furry tennis ball .
And the bottom curve is the weight of a normal mouse .
If you take the obese mouse and give it an angiogenesis inhibitor , it loses weight .
Stop the treatment , gains the weight back .
Restart the treatment , loses the weight again .
Stop the treatment , it gains the weight back .
And , in fact , you can cycle the weight up and down simply by inhibiting angiogenesis .
So this approach that we &apos;re taking for cancer prevention may also have an application for obesity .
The really , truly interesting thing about this is that we can &apos;t take these obese mice and make them lose more weight than what the normal mouse &apos;s weight is supposed to be .
In other words , we can &apos;t create supermodel mice .
And this speaks to the role of angiogenesis in regulating healthy set points .
Albert Szent-Gyorgi once said that , &quot; Discovery consists of seeing what everyone has seen , and thinking what no one has thought . &quot;
I hope I &apos;ve convinced you that , for diseases like cancer , obesity and other conditions , that there may be a great power in attacking their common denominator : angiogenesis .
And that &apos;s what I think the world needs now . Thank you .
I have a quick question for you . So these drugs aren &apos;t exactly ...
they &apos;re not exactly in mainstream cancer treatments right now .
For anyone out here who has cancer , what would you recommend ?
Do you recommend pursuing these treatments now , for most cancer patients ?
William Li : So there are antiangiogenic treatments that are FDA approved , and if you &apos;re a cancer patient or working for one or advocating for one , you should ask about them .
And there are many clinical trials .
The Angiogenesis Foundation is following almost 300 companies , and there are about 100 more drugs in that pipeline .
So consider the approved ones , look for clinical trials , but then between what the doctor can do for you , we need to start asking what can we do for ourselves .
And this is one of the themes that I &apos;m talking about is we can empower ourselves to do the things that doctors can &apos;t do for us , which is to use knowledge and take action .
And if Mother Nature has given us some clues , we think that there might be a new future in the value of how we eat .
And what we eat is really our chemotherapy three times a day .
Right . And along those lines , for people who might have risk factors for cancer , would you recommend pursuing any treatments sort of prophylactically or simply pursuing the right diet with lots of tomato sauce ?
WL : Well , you know , there &apos;s abundant epidemiological evidence .
And I think in the information age , it doesn &apos;t take long to go to a credible source like PubMed , the National Library of Medicine , to look for epidemiological studies for cancer risk reduction based on diet and based on common medications .
And that &apos;s certainly something that anybody can look into .
Okay . Well , thank you so much .

This is the Large Hadron Collider .
It &apos;s 27 kilometers in circumference .
It &apos;s the biggest scientific experiment ever attempted .
Over 10,000 physicists and engineers from 85 countries around the world have come together over several decades to build this machine .
What we do is we accelerate protons -- so , hydrogen nuclei -- around 99.999999 percent the speed of light .
Right ? At that speed , they go around that 27 kilometers 11,000 times a second .
And we collide them with another beam of protons going in the opposite direction .
We collide them inside giant detectors .
They &apos;re essentially digital cameras .
And this is the one that I work on , ATLAS .
You get some sense of the size -- you can just see these EU standard-size people underneath .
You get some sense of the size : 44 meters wide , 22 meters in diameter , 7,000 tons .
And we re-create the conditions that were present less than a billionth of a second after the universe began up to 600 million times a second inside that detector -- immense numbers .
And if you see those metal bits there -- those are huge magnets that bend electrically charged particles , so it can measure how fast they &apos;re traveling .
This is a picture about a year ago .
Those magnets are in there .
And , again , a EU standard-size , real person , so you get some sense of the scale .
And it &apos;s in there that those mini-Big Bangs will be created , sometime in the summer this year .
And actually , this morning , I got an email saying that we &apos;ve just finished , today , building the last piece of ATLAS .
So as of today , it &apos;s finished . I &apos;d like to say that I planned that for TED , but I didn &apos;t . So it &apos;s been completed as of today .
Yeah , it &apos;s a wonderful achievement .
So , you might be asking , &quot; Why ?
Why create the conditions that were present less than a billionth of a second after the universe began ? &quot;
Well , particle physicists are nothing if not ambitious .
And the aim of particle physics is to understand what everything &apos;s made of , and how everything sticks together .
And by everything I mean , of course , me and you , the Earth , the Sun , the 100 billion suns in our galaxy and the 100 billion galaxies in the observable universe .
Absolutely everything .
Now you might say , &quot; Well , OK , but why not just look at it ?
You know ? If you want to know what I &apos;m made of , let &apos;s look at me . &quot;
Well , we found that as you look back in time , the universe gets hotter and hotter , denser and denser , and simpler and simpler .
Now , there &apos;s no real reason I &apos;m aware of for that , but that seems to be the case .
So , way back in the early times of the universe , we believe it was very simple and understandable .
All this complexity , all the way to these wonderful things -- human brains -- are a property of an old and cold and complicated universe .
Back at the start , in the first billionth of a second , we believe , or we &apos;ve observed , it was very simple .
It &apos;s almost like ...
imagine a snowflake in your hand , and you look at it , and it &apos;s an incredibly complicated , beautiful object . But as you heat it up , it &apos;ll melt into a pool of water , and you would be able to see that , actually , it was just made of H20 , water .
So it &apos;s in that same sense that we look back in time to understand what the universe is made of .
And , as of today , it &apos;s made of these things .
Just 12 particles of matter , stuck together by four forces of nature .
The quarks , these pink things , are the things that make up protons and neutrons that make up the atomic nuclei in your body .
The electron -- the thing that goes around the atomic nucleus -- held around in orbit , by the way , by the electromagnetic force that &apos;s carried by this thing , the photon .
The quarks are stuck together by other things called gluons .
And these guys , here , they &apos;re the weak nuclear force , probably the least familiar .
But , without it , the sun wouldn &apos;t shine .
And when the sun shines , you get copious quantities of these things , called neutrinos , pouring out .
Actually , if you just look at your thumbnail -- about a square centimeter -- there are something like 60 billion neutrinos per second from the sun , passing through every square centimeter of your body .
But you don &apos;t feel them , because the weak force is correctly named -- very short range and very weak , so they just fly through you .
And these particles have been discovered over the last century , pretty much .
The first one , the electron , was discovered in 1897 , and the last one , this thing called the tau neutrino , in the year 2000 . Actually just -- I was going to say , just up the road in Chicago . I know it &apos;s a big country , America , isn &apos;t it ?
Just up the road .
Relative to the universe , it &apos;s just up the road .
So , this thing was discovered in the year 2000 , so it &apos;s a relatively recent picture .
One of the wonderful things , actually , I find , is that we &apos;ve discovered any of them , when you realize how tiny they are .
You know , they &apos;re a step in size from the entire observable universe .
So , 100 billion galaxies , 13.7 billion light years away -- a step in size from that to Monterey , actually , is about the same as from Monterey to these things .
Absolutely , exquisitely minute , and yet we &apos;ve discovered pretty much the full set .
So , one of my most illustrious forebears at Manchester University , Ernest Rutherford , discoverer of the atomic nucleus , once said , &quot; All science is either physics or stamp collecting . &quot;
Now , I don &apos;t think he meant to insult the rest of science , although he was from New Zealand , so it &apos;s possible .
But what he meant was that what we &apos;ve done , really , is stamp collect there .
OK , we &apos;ve discovered the particles , but unless you understand the underlying reason for that pattern -- you know , why it &apos;s built the way it is -- really you &apos;ve done stamp collecting . You haven &apos;t done science .
Fortunately , we have probably one of the greatest scientific achievements of the twentieth century that underpins that pattern .
It &apos;s the Newton &apos;s laws , if you want , of particle physics .
It &apos;s called the standard model -- beautifully simple mathematical equation .
You could stick it on the front of a T-shirt , which is always the sign of elegance .
This is it .
I &apos;ve been a little disingenuous , because I &apos;ve expanded it out in all its gory detail .
This equation , though , allows you to calculate everything -- other than gravity -- that happens in the universe .
So , you want to know why the sky is blue , why atomic nuclei stick together -- in principle , you &apos;ve got a big enough computer -- why DNA is the shape it is .
In principle , you should be able to calculate it from that equation .
But there &apos;s a problem .
Can anyone see what it is ?
A bottle of champagne for anyone that tells me .
I &apos;ll make it easier , actually , by blowing one of the lines up .
Basically , each of these terms refers to some of the particles .
So those Ws there refer to the Ws , and how they stick together .
These carriers of the weak force , the Zs , the same .
But there &apos;s an extra symbol in this equation : H.
Right , H.
H stands for Higgs particle .
Higgs particles have not been discovered .
But they &apos;re necessary : they &apos;re necessary to make that mathematics work .
So all the exquisitely detailed calculations we can do with that wonderful equation wouldn &apos;t be possible without an extra bit .
So it &apos;s a prediction : a prediction of a new particle .
What does it do ?
Well , we had a long time to come up with good analogies .
And back in the 1980s , when we wanted the money for the LHC from the U.K. government , Margaret Thatcher , at the time , said , &quot; If you guys can explain , in language a politician can understand , I want to know what this Higgs particle does . &quot;
And we came up with this analogy , and it seemed to work .
Well , what the Higgs does is , it gives mass to the fundamental particles .
And the picture is that the whole universe -- and that doesn &apos;t mean just space , it means me as well , and inside you -- the whole universe is full of something called a Higgs field .
Higgs particles , if you will .
The analogy is that these people in a room are the Higgs particles .
Now when a particle moves through the universe , it can interact with these Higgs particles .
But imagine someone who &apos;s not very popular moves through the room .
Then everyone ignores them . They can just pass through the room very quickly , essentially at the speed of light . They &apos;re massless .
And imagine someone incredibly important and popular and intelligent walks into the room .
They &apos;re surrounded by people , and their passage through the room is impeded .
It &apos;s almost like they get heavy . They get massive .
And that &apos;s exactly the way the Higgs mechanism works .
The picture is that the electrons and the quarks in your body and in the universe that we see around us are heavy , in a sense , and massive , because they &apos;re surrounded by Higgs particles .
They &apos;re interacting with the Higgs field .
If that picture &apos;s true , then we have to discover those Higgs particles at the LHC .
If it &apos;s not true -- because it &apos;s quite a convoluted mechanism , although it &apos;s the simplest we &apos;ve been able to think of -- then whatever does the job of the Higgs particles we know have to turn up at the LHC .
So , that &apos;s one of the prime reasons we built this giant machine .
I &apos;m glad you recognize Margaret Thatcher .
Actually , I thought about making it more culturally relevant , but -- anyway .
So that &apos;s one thing .
That &apos;s essentially a guarantee of what the LHC will find .
There are many other things . You &apos;ve heard many of the big problems in particle physics .
One of them you heard about : dark matter , dark energy .
There &apos;s another issue , which is that the forces in nature -- it &apos;s quite beautiful , actually -- seem , as you go back in time , they seem to change in strength .
Well , they do change in strength .
So , the electromagnetic force , the force that holds us together , gets stronger as you go to higher temperatures .
The strong force , the strong nuclear force , which sticks nuclei together , gets weaker . And what you see is the standard model -- you can calculate how these change -- is the forces , the three forces , other than gravity , almost seem to come together at one point .
It &apos;s almost as if there was one beautiful But they just miss .
Now there &apos;s a theory called super-symmetry , which doubles the number of particles in the standard model , which , at first sight , doesn &apos;t sound like a simplification .
But actually , with this theory , we find that the forces of nature do seem to unify together , back at the Big Bang -- absolutely beautiful prophecy . The model wasn &apos;t built to do that , but it seems to do it .
Also , those super-symmetric particles are very strong candidates for the dark matter .
So a very compelling theory that &apos;s really mainstream physics .
And if I was to put money on it , I would put money on -- in a very unscientific way -- that that these things would also crop up at the LHC .
Many other things that the LHC could discover .
But in the last few minutes , I just want to give you a different perspective of what I think -- what particle physics really means to me -- particle physics and cosmology .
And that &apos;s that I think it &apos;s given us a wonderful narrative -- almost a creation story , if you &apos;d like -- about the universe , from modern science over the last few decades .
And I &apos;d say that it deserves , in the spirit of Wade Davis &apos; talk , to be at least put up there with these wonderful creation stories of the peoples of the high Andes and the frozen north .
This is a creation story , I think , equally as wonderful .
The story goes like this : we know that the universe began 13.7 billion years ago , in an immensely hot , dense state , much smaller than a single atom .
It began to expand about a million , billion , billion , billion billionth of a second -- I think I got that right -- after the Big Bang .
Gravity separated away from the other forces .
The universe then underwent an exponential expansion called inflation .
In about the first billionth of a second or so , the Higgs field kicked in , and the quarks and the gluons and the electrons that make us up got mass .
The universe continued to expand and cool .
After about a few minutes , there was hydrogen and helium in the universe . That &apos;s all .
The universe was about 75 percent hydrogen , 25 percent helium . It still is today .
It continued to expand about 300 million years .
Then light began to travel through the universe .
It was big enough to be transparent to light , and that &apos;s what we see in the cosmic microwave background that George Smoot described as looking at the face of God .
After about 400 million years , the first stars formed , and that hydrogen , that helium , then began to cook into the heavier elements .
So the elements of life -- carbon , and oxygen and iron , all the elements that we need to make us up -- were cooked in those first generations of stars , which then ran out of fuel , exploded , threw those elements back into the universe .
They then re-collapsed into another generation of stars and planets .
And on some of those planets , the oxygen , which had been created in that first generation of stars , could fuse with hydrogen to form water , liquid water on the surface .
On at least one , and maybe only one of those planets , primitive life evolved , which evolved over millions of years into things that walked upright and left footprints about three and a half million years ago in the mud flats of Tanzania , and eventually left a footprint on another world .
And built this civilization , this wonderful picture , that turned the darkness into light , and you can see the civilization from space .
As one of my great heroes , Carl Sagan , said , these are the things -- and actually , not only these , but I was looking around -- these are the things , like Saturn V rockets , and Sputnik , and DNA , and literature and science -- these are the things that hydrogen atoms do when given 13.7 billion years .
Absolutely remarkable .
And , the laws of physics . Right ?
So , the right laws of physics -- they &apos;re beautifully balanced .
If the weak force had been a little bit different , then carbon and oxygen wouldn &apos;t be stable inside the hearts of stars , and there would be none of that in the universe .
And I think that &apos;s a wonderful and significant story .
50 years ago , I couldn &apos;t have told that story , because we didn &apos;t know it .
It makes me really feel that that civilization -- which , as I say , if you believe the scientific creation story , has emerged purely as a result of the laws of physics , and a few hydrogen atoms -- then I think , to me anyway , it makes me feel incredibly valuable .
So that &apos;s the LHC .
The LHC is certainly , when it turns on in summer , going to write the next chapter of that book .
And I &apos;m certainly looking forward with immense excitement to it being turned on .
Thanks .

Now , if President Obama invited me to be the next Czar of Mathematics , then I would have a suggestion for him that I think would vastly improve the mathematics education in this country .
And it would be easy to implement and inexpensive .
The mathematics curriculum that we have is based on a foundation of arithmetic and algebra .
And everything we learn after that is building up towards one subject .
And at top of that pyramid , it &apos;s calculus .
And I &apos;m here to say that I think that that is the wrong summit of the pyramid ...
that the correct summit -- that all of our students , every high school graduate should know -- should be statistics : probability and statistics .
I mean , don &apos;t get me wrong . Calculus is an important subject .
It &apos;s one of the great products of the human mind .
The laws of nature are written in the language of calculus .
And every student who studies math , science , engineering , economics , they should definitely learn calculus by the end of their freshman year of college .
But I &apos;m here to say , as a professor of mathematics , that very few people actually use calculus in a conscious , meaningful way , in their day-to-day lives .
On the other hand , statistics -- that &apos;s a subject that you could , and should , use on daily basis . Right ?
It &apos;s risk . It &apos;s reward . It &apos;s randomness .
It &apos;s understanding data .
I think if our students , if our high school students -- if all of the American citizens -- knew about probability and statistics , we wouldn &apos;t be in the economic mess that we &apos;re in today .
Not only -- thank you -- not only that ...
but if it &apos;s taught properly , it can be a lot of fun .
I mean , probability and statistics , it &apos;s the mathematics of games and gambling .
It &apos;s analyzing trends . It &apos;s predicting the future .
Look , the world has changed from analog to digital .
And it &apos;s time for our mathematics curriculum to change from analog to digital , from the more classical , continuous mathematics , to the more modern , discrete mathematics -- the mathematics of uncertainty , of randomness , of data -- that being probability and statistics .
In summary , instead of our students learning about the techniques of calculus , I think it would be far more significant if all of them knew what two standard deviations from the mean means . And I mean it .
Thank you very much .

When I was a child , I always wanted to be a superhero .
I wanted to save the world and then make everyone happy .
But I knew that I &apos;d need superpowers to make my dreams come true .
So I used to embark on these imaginary journeys to find intergalactic objects from planet Krypton , which was a lot of fun , but didn &apos;t get much result .
When I grew up and realized that science fiction was not a good source for superpowers , I decided instead to embark on a journey of real science , to find a more useful truth .
I started my journey in California with a UC Berkley 30-year longitudinal study that examined the photos of students in an old yearbook and tried to measure their success and well-being throughout their life .
By measuring their student smiles , researchers were able to predict how fulfilling and long-lasting a subject &apos;s marriage will be , how well she would score on standardized tests of well-being and how inspiring she would be to others .
In another yearbook , I stumbled upon Barry Obama &apos;s picture .
When I first saw his picture , I thought that these superpowers came from his super collar .
But now I know it was all in his smile .
Another aha ! moment came from a 2010 Wayne State University research project that looked into pre-1950s baseball cards of Major League players .
The researchers found that the span of a player &apos;s smile could actually predict the span of his life .
Players who didn &apos;t smile in their pictures lived an average of only 72.9 years , where players with beaming smiles lived an average of almost 80 years .
The good news is that we &apos;re actually born smiling .
Using 3D ultrasound technology , we can now see that developing babies appear to smile , even in the womb .
When they &apos;re born , babies continue to smile -- initially , mostly in their sleep .
And even blind babies smile to the sound of the human voice .
Smiling is one of the most basic , biologically-uniform expressions of all humans .
In studies conducted in Papua New Guinea , Paul Ekman , the world &apos;s most renowned researcher on facial expressions , found that even members of the Fore tribe , who were completely disconnected from Western culture , and also known for their unusual cannibalism rituals , attributed smiles to descriptions of situations the same way you and I would .
So from Papua New Guinea to Hollywood all the way to modern art in Beijing , we smile often , and you smile to express joy and satisfaction .
How many people here in this room smile more than 20 times per day ?
Raise your hand if you do . Oh , wow .
Outside of this room , more than a third of us smile more than 20 times per day , whereas less than 14 percent of us smile less than five .
In fact , those with the most amazing superpowers are actually children , who smile as many as 400 times per day .
Have you ever wondered why being around children who smile so frequently makes you smile very often ?
A recent study at Uppsala University in Sweden found that it &apos;s very difficult to frown when looking at someone who smiles .
You ask , why ?
Because smiling is evolutionarily contagious , and it suppresses the control we usually have on our facial muscles .
Mimicking a smile and experiencing it physically help us understand whether our smile is fake or real , so we can understand the emotional state of the smiler .
In a recent mimicking study at the University of Clermont-Ferrand in France , subjects were asked to determine whether a smile was real or fake while holding a pencil in their mouth to repress smiling muscles .
Without the pencil , subjects were excellent judges , but with the pencil in their mouth -- when they could not mimic the smile they saw -- their judgment was impaired .
In addition to theorizing on evolution in &quot; The Origin of Species , &quot; Charles Darwin also wrote the facial feedback response theory .
His theory states that the act of smiling itself actually makes us feel better -- rather than smiling being merely a result of feeling good .
In his study , Darwin actually cited a French neurologist , Guillaume Duchenne , who used electric jolts to facial muscles to induce and stimulate smiles .
Please , don &apos;t try this at home .
In a related German study , researchers used fMRI imaging to measure brain activity before and after injecting Botox to suppress smiling muscles .
The finding supported Darwin &apos;s theory by showing that facial feedback modifies the neural processing of emotional content in the brain in a way that helps us feel better when we smile .
Smiling stimulates our brain reward mechanism in a way that even chocolate -- a well-regarded pleasure inducer -- cannot match .
British researchers found that one smile can generate the same level of brain stimulation as up to 2,000 bars of chocolate .
Wait . The same study found that smiling is as stimulating as receiving up to 16,000 pounds Sterling in cash .
That &apos;s like 25 grand a smile .
It &apos;s not bad .
And think about it this way : 25,000 times 400 -- quite a few kids out there feel like Mark Zuckerberg every day .
And , unlike lots of chocolate , lots of smiling can actually make you healthier .
Smiling can help reduce the level of stress-enhancing hormones like cortisol , adrenaline and dopamine , increase the level of mood-enhancing hormones like endorphin and reduce overall blood pressure .
And if that &apos;s not enough , smiling can actually make you look good in the eyes of others .
A recent study at Penn State University found that when you smile , you don &apos;t only appear to be more likable and courteous , but you actually appear to be more competent .
So whenever you want to look great and competent , reduce your stress or improve your marriage , or feel as if you just had a whole stack of high-quality chocolate -- without incurring the caloric cost -- or as if you found 25 grand in a pocket of an old jacket you hadn &apos;t worn for ages , or whenever you want to tap into a superpower that will help you and everyone around you live a longer , healthier , happier life , smile .

Namaste . Good morning .
I &apos;m very happy to be here in India .
And I &apos;ve been thinking a lot about what I have learned over these last particularly 11 years with V-Day and &quot; The Vagina Monologues , &quot; traveling the world , essentially meeting with women and girls across the planet to stop violence against women .
What I want to talk about today is this particular cell , or grouping of cells , that is in each and every one of us .
And I want to call it the girl cell .
And it &apos;s in men as well as in women .
I want you to imagine that this particular grouping of cells is central to the evolution of our species and the continuation of the human race .
And I want you imagine that at some point in history a group of powerful people invested in owning and controlling the world understood that the suppression of this particular cell , the oppression of these cells , the reinterpretation of these cells , the undermining of these cells , getting us to believe in the weakness of these cells and the crushing , eradicating , destroying , reducing these cells , basically began the process of killing off the girl cell , which was , by the way , patriarchy .
I want you to imagine that the girl is a chip in the huge macrocosm of collective consciousness .
And it is essential to balance , to wisdom and to actually the future of all of us .
And then I want you to imagine that this girl cell is compassion , and it &apos;s empathy , and it &apos;s passion itself , and it &apos;s vulnerability , and it &apos;s openness , and it &apos;s intensity , and it &apos;s association , and it &apos;s relationship , and it is intuitive .
And then let &apos;s think how compassion informs wisdom , and that vulnerability is our greatest strength , and that emotions have inherent logic , which lead to radical , appropriate , saving action .
And then let &apos;s remember that we &apos;ve been taught the exact opposite by the powers that be , that compassion clouds your thinking , that it gets in the way , that vulnerability is weakness , that emotions are not to be trusted , and you &apos;re not supposed to take things personally , which is one of my favorites .
I think the whole world has essentially been brought up not to be a girl .
How do we bring up boys ? What does it mean to be a boy ?
To be a boy really means not to be a girl .
To be a man means not to be a girl .
To be a woman means not to be a girl .
To be strong means not to be a girl .
To be a leader means not to be a girl .
I actually think that being a girl is so powerful that we &apos;ve had to train everyone not to be that .
And I &apos;d also like to say that the irony of course , is that denying girl , suppressing girl , suppressing emotion , refusing feeling has lead thus here .
Where we have now come to live in a world where the most extreme forms of violence , the most horrific poverty , genocide , mass rapes , the destruction of the Earth , is completely out of control .
And because we have suppressed our girl cells and suppressed our girl-ship , we do not feel what is going on .
So , we are not being charged with the adequate response to what is happening .
I want to talk a little bit about the Democratic Republic of Congo .
For me , it was the turning point of my life .
I have spent a lot of time there in the last three years .
I feel up to that point I had seen a lot in the world , a lot of violence .
I essentially lived in the rape mines of the world for the last 12 years .
But the Democratic Republic of Congo really was the turning point in my soul .
I went and I spent time in a place called Bukavu in a hospital called the Panzi Hospital , with a doctor who was as close to a saint as any person I &apos;ve ever met .
His name is Dr. Denis Mukwege .
In the Congo , for those of you who don &apos;t know , there has been a war raging for the last 12 years , a war that has killed nearly six million people .
It is estimated that somewhere between 300,000 and 500,000 women have been raped there .
When I spent my first weeks at Panzi hospital I sat with women who sat and lined up every day to tell me their stories .
Their stories were so horrific , and so mind-blowing and so on the other side of human existence , that to be perfectly honest with you , I was shattered .
And I will tell you that what happened is through that shattering , listening to the stories of eight-year-old girls who had their insides eviscerated , who had guns and bayonets and things shoved inside them so they had holes , literally , inside them where their pee and poop came out of them .
Listening to the story of 80-year-old women who were tied to chains and circled , and where groups of men would come and rape them periodically , all in the name of economic exploitation to steal the minerals so the West can have it and profit from them .
My mind was so shattered .
But what happened for me is that that shattering actually emboldened me in a way I have never been emboldened .
That shattering , that opening of my girl cell , that kind of massive breakthrough of my heart allowed me to become more courageous , and braver , and actually more clever than I had been in the past in my life .
I want to say that I think the powers that be know that empire-building is actually -- that feelings get in the way of empire-building .
Feelings get in the way of the mass acquisition of the Earth , and excavating the Earth , and destroying things .
I remember , for example , when my father , who was very , very violent , used to beat me .
And he would actually say , while he was beating me , &quot; Don &apos;t you cry . Don &apos;t you dare cry . &quot;
Because my crying somehow exposed his brutality to him .
And even in the moment he didn &apos;t want to be reminded of what he was doing .
I know that we have systematically annihilated the girl cell .
And I want to say we &apos;ve annihilated it in men as well as in women .
And I think in some ways we &apos;ve been much harsher to men in the annihilation of their girl cell .
I see how boys have been brought up , and I see this across the planet : to be tough , to be hardened , to distance themselves from their tenderness , to not cry .
I actually realized once in Kosovo , when I watched a man break down , that bullets are actually hardened tears , that when we don &apos;t allow men to have their girl self and have their vulnerability , and have their compassion , and have their hearts , that they become hardened and hurtful and violent .
And I think we have taught men to be secure when they are insecure , to pretend they know things when they don &apos;t know things , or why would we be where we are ?
To pretend they &apos;re not a mess when they are a mess .
And I will tell you a very funny story .
On my way here on the airplane , I was walking up and down the aisle of the plane .
And all these men , literally at least 10 men , were in their little seats watching chick flicks .
And they were all alone , and I thought , &quot; This is the secret life of men . &quot;
I &apos;ve traveled , as I said , to many , many countries , and I &apos;ve seen , if we do what we do to the girl inside us then obviously it &apos;s horrific to think what we do to girls in the world .
And we heard from Sunitha yesterday , and Kavita about what we do to girls .
But I just want to say that I &apos;ve met girls with knife wounds and cigarette burns , who are literally being treated like ashtrays .
I &apos;ve seen girls be treated like garbage cans .
I &apos;ve seen girls who were beaten by their mothers and brothers and fathers and uncles .
I &apos;ve seen girls starving themselves to death in America in institutions to look like some idealized version of themselves .
I &apos;ve seen that we cut girls and we control them and we keep them illiterate , or we make them feel bad about being too smart .
We silence them . We make them feel guilty for being smart . We get them to behave , to tone it down , not to be too intense .
We sell them , we kill them as embryos , we enslave them , we rape them .
We are so accustomed to robbing girls of the subject of being the subjects of their lives that we have now actually objectified them and turned them into commodities .
The selling of girls is rampant across the planet .
And in many places they are worth less than goats and cows .
But I also want to talk about the fact that if one in eight people on the planet are girls between the ages of 10 to 24 , they are they key , really , in the developing world , as well as in the whole world , to the future of humanity .
And if girls are in trouble because they face systematic disadvantages that keep them where society wants them to be , including lack of access to healthcare , education , healthy foods , labor force participation .
The burden of all the household tasks usually falls on girls and younger siblings , which ensures that they will never overcome these barriers .
The state of girls , the condition of girls , will , in my belief -- and that &apos;s the girl inside us and the girl in the world -- determine whether the species survives .
And what I want to suggest is that , having talked to girls , because I just finished a new book called &quot; I Am an Emotional Creature : The Secret Life of Girls Around the World , &quot; I &apos;ve been talking to girls for five years , and one of the things that I &apos;ve seen is true everywhere is that the verb that &apos;s been enforced on girl is the verb &quot; to please . &quot;
Girls are trained to please .
I want to change the verb .
I want us all to change the verb .
I want the verb to be &quot; educate , &quot; or &quot; activate , &quot; or &quot; engage , &quot; or &quot; confront , &quot; or &quot; defy , &quot; or &quot; create . &quot;
If we teach girls to change the verb we will actually enforce the girl inside us and the girl inside them .
And I have to now share a few stories of girls I &apos;ve seen across the planet who have engaged their girl , who have taken on their girl in spite of all the circumstances around them .
I know a 14-year-old girl in the Netherlands , and go around the entire world by herself .
There is a teenage girl who just recently went out and knew that she needed 56 stars tattooed on the right side of her face .
There is a girl , Julia Butterfly Hill , who lived for a year in a tree because she wanted to protect the wild oaks .
There is a girl who I met 14 years ago in Afghanistan who I have adopted as my daughter because her mother was killed . Her mother was a revolutionary .
And this girl , when she was 17 years old , wore a burqa in Afghanistan , and went into the stadiums and documented the atrocities that were going on towards women , underneath her burqa , with a video .
And that video became the video that went out all over the world after 9 / 11 to show what was going on in Afghanistan .
I want to talk about Rachel Corrie who was in her teens when she stood in front of an Israeli tank to say , &quot; End the occupation . &quot;
And she knew she risked death and she was literally gunned down and rolled over by that tank .
And I want to talk about a girl that I just met recently in Bukavu , who was impregnated by her rapist .
And she was holding her baby .
And I asked her if she loved her baby .
And she looked into her baby &apos;s eyes and she said , &quot; Of course I love my baby . How could I not love my baby ?
It &apos;s my baby and it &apos;s full of love . &quot;
The capacity for girls to overcome situations and to move on levels , to me , is mind-blowing .
There is a girl named Dorcas , and I just met her in Kenya .
Dorcas is 15 years old , and she was trained in self-defense .
A few months ago she was picked up on the street by three older men .
They kidnapped her , they put her in a car .
And through her self-defense , she grabbed their Adam &apos;s apples , she punched them in the eyes and she got herself free and out of the car .
In Kenya , in August , I went to visit one of the V-Day safe houses for girls , a house we opened seven years ago with an amazing woman named Agnes Pareyio .
Agnes was a woman who was cut when she was a little girl , she was female genitally mutilated .
And she made a decision as many women do across this planet , that what was done to her would not be enforced and done to other women and girls .
So , for years Agnes walked through the Rift valley .
She taught girls what a healthy vagina looked like , and what a mutilated vagina looked like .
And in that time she saved many girls . And when we met her we asked her what we could do for her , and she said , &quot; Well , if you got me a Jeep I could get around a lot faster . &quot;
So , we got her a Jeep . And then she saved 4,500 girls .
And then we asked her , &quot; Okay , what else do you need ? &quot;
And she said , &quot; Well , now , I need a house . &quot;
So , seven years ago Agnes built the first V-Day safe house in Narok , Kenya , in the Masai land .
And it was a house where girls could run away , they could save their clitoris , they wouldn &apos;t be cut , they could go to school .
And in the years that Agnes has had the house , she has changed the situation there .
She has literally become deputy mayor .
She &apos;s changed the rules .
The whole community has bought in to what she &apos;s doing .
When we were there she was doing a ritual where she reconciles girls , who have run away , with their families .
And there was a young girl named Jaclyn .
Jaclyn was 14 years old and she was in her Masai family and there &apos;s a drought in Kenya .
So cows are dying , and cows are the most valued possession .
And Jaclyn overheard her father talking to an old man about how he was about to sell her for the cows .
And she knew that meant she would be cut .
She knew that meant she wouldn &apos;t go to school .
She knew that meant she wouldn &apos;t have a future .
She knew she would have to marry that old man , and she was 14 .
So , one afternoon , she &apos;d heard about the safe house , Jaclyn left her father &apos;s house and she walked for two days , two days through Masai land .
She slept with the hyenas . She hid at night .
She imagined her father killing her on one hand , and Mama Agnes greeting her , with the hope that she would greet her when she got to the house .
And when she got to the house she was greeted .
Agnes took her in , and Agnes loved her , and Agnes supported her for the year .
She went to school and she found her voice , and she found her identity , and she found her heart .
Then , her time was ready when she had to go back to talk to her father about the reconciliation , after a year .
I had the privilege of being in the hut when she was reunited with her father and reconciled .
In that hut , we walked in , and her father and his four wives were sitting there , and her sisters who had just returned because they had all fled when she had fled , and her primary mother , who had been beaten in standing up for her with the elders .
When her father saw her and saw who she had become , in her full girl self , he threw his arms around her and broke down crying .
He said , &quot; You are beautiful . You have grown into a gorgeous woman .
We will not cut you .
And I give you my word , here and now , that we will not cut your sisters either . &quot;
And what she said to him was , &quot; You were willing to sell me for four cows , and a calf and some blankets .
But I promise you , now that I will be educated I will always take care of you , and I will come back and I will build you a house .
And I will be in your corner for the rest of your life . &quot;
For me , that is the power of girls .
And that is the power of transformation .
I want to close today with a new piece from my book .
And I want to do it tonight for the girl in everybody here .
And I want to do it for Sunitha .
And I want to do it for the girls that Sunitha talked about yesterday , the girls who survive , the girls who can become somebody else .
But I really want to do it for each and every person here , to value the girl in us , to value the part that cries , to value the part that &apos;s emotional , to value the part that &apos;s vulnerable , to understand that &apos;s where the future lies .
This is called &quot; I &apos;m An Emotional Creature . &quot;
And it happened because I met a girl in Watts , L.A.
I was asking girls if they like being a girl , and all the girls were like , &quot; No , I hate it . I can &apos;t stand it .
It &apos;s all bad . My brothers get everything . &quot;
And this girl just sat up and went , &quot; I love being a girl .
I &apos;m an emotional creature ! &quot;
This is for her : I love being a girl .
I can feel what you &apos;re feeling as you &apos;re feeling inside the feeling before .
I am an emotional creature .
Things do not come to me as intellectual theories or hard-pressed ideas .
They pulse through my organs and legs and burn up my ears .
Oh , I know when your girlfriend &apos;s really pissed off , even though she appears to give you what you want .
I know when a storm is coming .
I can feel the invisible stirrings in the air .
I can tell you he won &apos;t call back . It &apos;s a vibe I share .
I am an emotional creature .
I love that I do not take things lightly .
Everything is intense to me , the way I walk in the street , the way my momma wakes me up , the way it &apos;s unbearable when I lose , the way I hear bad news .
I am an emotional creature .
I am connected to everything and everyone . I was born like that .
Don &apos;t you say all negative that it &apos;s only only a teenage thing , or it &apos;s only because I &apos;m a girl .
These feelings make me better .
They make me present . They make me ready . They make me strong .
I am an emotional creature .
There is a particular way of knowing .
It &apos;s like the older women somehow forgot .
I rejoice that it &apos;s still in my body .
Oh , I know when the coconut &apos;s about to fall .
I know we have pushed the Earth too far .
I know my father isn &apos;t coming back , and that no one &apos;s prepared for the fire .
I know that lipstick means more than show , and boys are super insecure , and so-called terrorists are made , not born .
I know that one kiss could take away all my decision-making ability .
And you know what ? Sometimes it should .
This is not extreme . It &apos;s a girl thing , what we would all be if the big door inside us flew open .
Don &apos;t tell me not to cry , to calm it down , not to be so extreme , to be reasonable .
I am an emotional creature .
It &apos;s how the earth got made , how the wind continues to pollinate .
You don &apos;t tell the Atlantic Ocean to behave .
I am an emotional creature .
Why would you want to shut me down or turn me off ?
I am your remaining memory .
I can take you back .
Nothing &apos;s been diluted .
Nothing &apos;s leaked out .
I love , hear me , I love that I can feel the feelings inside you , even if they stop my life , even if they break my heart , even if they take me off track , they make me responsible .
I am an emotional , I am an emotional , incondotional , devotional creature .
And I love , hear me , I love , love , love being a girl .
Can you say it with me ?
I love , I love , love , love being a girl !
Thank you very much .

I am a Ph.D. student and that means I have a question : how can we make digital content graspable ?
Because you see , on the one hand , there is the digital world and no question , many things are happening there right now .
And for us humans , it &apos;s not quite material , it &apos;s not really there -- it &apos;s virtual .
On the other hand , we humans , we live in a physical world .
It &apos;s rich , it tastes good , it feels good , it smells good .
So the question is : how do we get the stuff over from the digital into the physical ?
That &apos;s my question .
If you look at the iPhone with its touch and the Wii with its bodily activity , you can see the tendency ; it &apos;s getting physical .
The question is : what &apos;s next ?
Now , I have three options that I would like to show you .
The first one is mass .
As humans , we are sensitive to where an object in our hand is heavy .
So , could we use that in mobile phones ?
Let me show you the weight-shifting mobile .
It is a mobile phone-shaped box that has an iron weight inside , which we can move around , and you can feel where it &apos;s heavy .
We shift the gravitational center of it .
For example , we can augment digital content with physical mass .
So you move around the content on a display , but you can also feel where it is just from the weight of the device .
Another thing it &apos;s good for is navigation -- it can guide you around in a city .
It can tell you by its weight , &quot; Okay , move right . Walk ahead . Make a left here . &quot;
And the good thing about that is you don &apos;t have to look at the device all the time ; you have your eyes free to see the city .
Now , mass is the first thing ; the second thing , that &apos;s shape .
We &apos;re also sensitive to the shape of objects we have in &#91; our &#93; hands .
So if I download an e-book and it has 20 pages -- well , they could be thin , right -- but if it has 500 pages , I want to feel that &quot; Harry Potter &quot; -- it &apos;s thick .
So let me show you the shape-changing mobile .
Again , it &apos;s a mobile phone-shaped box , and this one can change its shape .
We can play with the shape itself .
For example , it can be thin in your pocket , which we of course want it to be ; but then if you hold it in your hand , it can lean towards you , be thick .
It &apos;s like tapered to the downside .
If you change the grasp , it can adjust to that .
It &apos;s also useful if you want to put it down on your nightstand to watch a movie or use as an alarm clock , it stands .
It &apos;s fairly simple .
Another thing is , sometimes we watch things on a mobile phone , they are bigger than the phone itself .
So in that case -- like here , there &apos;s an app that &apos;s bigger than the phone &apos;s screen -- the shape of the phone could tell you , &quot; Okay , off the screen right here , there is more content .
You can &apos;t see it , but it &apos;s there . &quot;
And you can feel that because it &apos;s thicker at that edge .
The shape is the second thing .
The third thing operates on a different level .
As humans , we are social , we are empathic , and that &apos;s great .
Wouldn &apos;t that be a way to make mobile phones more intuitive ?
Think of a hamster in the pocket .
Well , I can feel it , it &apos;s doing all right -- I don &apos;t have to check it .
Let me show you the living mobile phone .
So , once again , mobile phone-shaped box , but this one , it has a breath and a heartbeat , and it feels very organic .
And you can tell , it &apos;s relaxed right now .
Oh now , missed call , a new call , new girlfriend maybe -- very exciting .
How do we calm it down ?
You give it a pat behind the ears , and everything is all right again .
So , that &apos;s very intuitive , and that &apos;s what we want .
So , what we have seen are three ways to make the digital graspable for us .
And I think making it physical is a good way to do that .
What &apos;s behind that is a postulation , namely that not humans should get much more technical in the future ; rather than that , technology , a bit more human .

&lt; url &gt; http : / / www.ted.com / talks / aditi _ shankardass _ a _ second _ opinion _ on _ learning _ disorders.html &lt; / url &gt;
When I was 10 years old , a cousin of mine took me on a tour of his medical school .
And as a special treat , he took me to the pathology lab and took a real human brain out of the jar and placed it in my hands .
And there it was , the seat of human consciousness , the powerhouse of the human body , sitting in my hands .
And that day I knew that when I grew up , I was going to become a brain doctor , scientist , something or the other .
Years later , when I finally grew up , my dream came true .
And it was while I was doing my Ph.D.
on the neurological causes of dyslexia in children that I encountered a startling fact that I &apos;d like to share with you all today .
It is estimated that one in six children , that &apos;s one in six children , suffer from some developmental disorder .
This is a disorder that retards mental development in the child and causes permanent mental impairments .
Which means that each and every one of you here today knows at least one child that is suffering from a developmental disorder .
But here &apos;s what really perplexed me .
Despite the fact that each and every one of these disorders originates in the brain , most of these disorders are diagnosed solely on the basis of observable behavior .
But diagnosing a brain disorder without actually looking at the brain is analogous to treating a patient with a heart problem based on their physical symptoms , without even doing an ECG or a chest X-ray to look at the heart .
It seemed so intuitive to me .
To diagnose and treat a brain disorder accurately , it would be necessary to look at the brain directly .
Looking at behavior alone can miss a vital piece of the puzzle and provide an incomplete , or even a misleading , picture of the child &apos;s problems .
Yet , despite all the advances in medical technology , the diagnosis of brain disorders in one in six children still remained so limited .
And then I came across a team at Harvard University that had taken one such advanced medical technology and finally applied it , instead of in brain research , towards diagnosing brain disorders in children .
Their groundbreaking technology records the EEG , or the electrical activity of the brain , in real time , allowing us to watch the brain as it performs various functions and then detect even the slightest abnormality in any of these functions : vision , attention , language , audition .
A program called Brain Electrical Activity Mapping then triangulates the source of that abnormality in the brain .
And another program called Statistical Probability Mapping then performs mathematical calculations to determine whether any of these abnormalities are clinically significant , allowing us to provide a much more accurate neurological diagnosis of the child &apos;s symptoms .
And so I became the head of neurophysiology for the clinical arm of this team , and we &apos;re finally able to use this technology towards actually helping children with brain disorders .
And I &apos;m happy to say that I &apos;m now in the process of setting up this technology here in India .
I &apos;d like to tell you about one such child , whose story was also covered by ABC News .
Seven-year-old Justin Senigar came to our clinic with this diagnosis of very severe autism .
Like many autistic children , his mind was locked inside his body .
There were moments when he would actually space out for seconds at a time .
And the doctors told his parents he was never going to be able to communicate or interact socially , and he would probably never have too much language .
When we used this groundbreaking EEG technology to actually look at Justin &apos;s brain , the results were startling .
It turned out that Justin was almost certainly not autistic .
He was suffering from brain seizures that were impossible to see with the naked eye , but that were actually causing symptoms that mimicked those of autism .
After Justin was given anti-seizure medication , the change in him was amazing .
Within a period of 60 days , his vocabulary went from two to three words to 300 words .
And his communication and social interaction were improved so dramatically that he was enrolled into a regular school and even became a karate super champ .
Research shows that 50 percent of children , almost 50 percent of children diagnosed with autism are actually suffering from hidden brain seizures .
These are the faces of the children that I have tested with stories just like Justin .
All these children came to our clinic with a diagnosis of autism , attention deficit disorder , mental retardation , language problems .
Instead , our EEG scans revealed very specific problems hidden within their brains that couldn &apos;t possibly have been detected by their behavioral assessments .
So these EEG scans enabled us to provide these children with a much more accurate neurological diagnosis and much more targeted treatment .
For too long now , children with developmental disorders have suffered from misdiagnosis while their real problems have gone undetected and left to worsen .
And for too long , these children and their parents have suffered undue frustration and desperation .
But we are now in a new era of neuroscience , one in which we can finally look directly at brain function in real time with no risks and no side effects , non-invasively , and find the true source of so many disabilities in children .
So if I could inspire even a fraction of you in the audience today to share this pioneering diagnostic approach with even one parent whose child is suffering from a developmental disorder , then perhaps one more puzzle in one more brain will be solved .
One more mind will be unlocked .
And one more child who has been misdiagnosed or even undiagnosed by the system will finally realize his or her true potential while there &apos;s still time for his or her brain to recover .
And all this by simply watching the child &apos;s brainwaves .
Thank you .

Now , I want to start with a question : When was the last time you were called childish ?
For kids like me , being called childish can be a frequent occurrence .
Every time we make irrational demands , exhibit irresponsible behavior or display any other signs of being normal American citizens , we are called childish .
Which really bothers me .
After all , take a look at these events : Imperialism and colonization , world wars , George W. Bush .
Ask yourself , who &apos;s responsible ? Adults .
Now , what have kids done ?
Well , Anne Frank touched millions with her powerful account of the Holocaust , Ruby Bridges helped to end segregation in the United States , and , most recently , Charlie Simpson helped to raise 120,000 pounds for Haiti on his little bike .
So , as you can see evidenced by such examples , age has absolutely nothing to do with it .
The traits the word childish addresses are seen so often in adults that we should abolish this age-discriminatory word when it comes to criticizing behavior associated with irresponsibility and irrational thinking .
Thank you .
Then again , who &apos;s to say that certain types of irrational thinking aren &apos;t exactly what the world needs ?
Maybe you &apos;ve had grand plans before but stopped yourself , thinking , &quot; That &apos;s impossible , &quot; or , &quot; That costs too much , &quot; or , &quot; That won &apos;t benefit me . &quot;
For better or worse , we kids aren &apos;t hampered as much when it comes to thinking about reasons why not to do things .
Kids can be full of inspiring aspirations and hopeful thinking .
Like my wish that no one went hungry or that everything were a free kind of utopia .
How many of you still dream like that and believe in the possibilities ?
Sometimes a knowledge of history and the past failures of utopian ideals can be a burden because you know that if everything were free , then the food stocks would become depleted and scarce and lead to chaos .
On the other hand , we kids still dream about perfection .
And that &apos;s a good thing because in order to make anything a reality , you have to dream about it first .
In many ways , our audacity to imagine helps push the boundaries of possibility .
For instance , the Museum of Glass in Tacoma , Washington , my home state -- yoohoo Washington !
-- has a program called Kids Design Glass , and kids draw their own ideas for glass art .
Now , the resident artist said they got some of their best ideas through the program because kids don &apos;t think about the limitations of how hard it can be to blow glass into certain shapes ; they just think of good ideas .
Now , when you think of glass , you might think of colorful Chihuly designs or maybe Italian vases , but kids challenge glass artists to go beyond that into the realm of broken-hearted snakes and bacon boys , who you can see has meat vision .
Now , our inherent wisdom doesn &apos;t have to be insider &apos;s knowledge .
Kids already do a lot of learning from adults , and we have a lot to share .
I think that adults should start learning from kids .
Now , I do most of my speaking in front of an education crowd , teachers and students , and I like this analogy : It shouldn &apos;t just be a teacher at the head of the classroom telling students , &quot; Do this , do that . &quot;
The students should teach their teachers .
Learning between grown ups and kids should be reciprocal .
The reality , unfortunately , is a little different , and it has a lot to do with trust , or a lack of it .
Now , if you don &apos;t trust someone , you place restrictions on them , right ?
If I doubt my older sister &apos;s ability to pay back the 10 percent interest I established on her last loan , I &apos;m going to withhold her ability to get more money from me until she pays it back .
True story , by the way .
Now , adults seem to have a prevalently restrictive attitude towards kids from every &quot; don &apos;t do that , don &apos;t do this &quot; in the school handbook to restrictions on school Internet use .
As history points out , regimes become oppressive when they &apos;re fearful about keeping control .
And although adults may not be quite at the level of totalitarian regimes , kids have no , or very little say in making the rules , when really the attitude should be reciprocal , meaning that the adult population should learn and take into account the wishes of the younger population .
Now , what &apos;s even worse than restriction is that adults often underestimate kids abilities .
We love challenges , but when expectations are low , trust me , we will sink to them .
My own parents had anything but low expectations for me and my sister .
Okay , so they didn &apos;t tell us to become doctors or lawyers or anything like that , but my dad did read to us about Aristotle and pioneer germ fighters when lots of other kids were hearing &quot; The Wheels on the Bus Go Round and Round . &quot;
Well , we heard that one too , but &quot; Pioneer Germ Fighters &quot; totally rules .
I loved to write from the age of four , and when I was six my mom bought me my own laptop equipped with Microsoft Word .
Thank you Bill Gates and thank you Ma .
I wrote over 300 short stories on that little laptop , and I wanted to get published .
Instead of just scoffing at this heresy that a kid wanted to get published or saying wait until you &apos;re older , my parents were really supportive .
Many publishers were not quite so encouraging , one large children &apos;s publisher ironically saying that they didn &apos;t work with children -- children &apos;s publisher not working with children ?
I don &apos;t know , you &apos;re kind of alienating a large client there .
Now , one publisher , Action Publishing , was willing to take that leap and trust me and to listen to what I had to say .
They published my first book , &quot; Flying Fingers , &quot; -- you see it here -- and from there on , it &apos;s gone to speaking at hundreds of schools , keynoting to thousands of educators and finally , today , speaking to you .
I appreciate your attention today , because to show that you truly care , you listen .
But there &apos;s a problem with this rosy picture of kids being so much better than adults .
Kids grow up and become adults just like you .
Or just like you ? Really ?
The goal is not to turn kids into your kind of adult , but rather better adults than you have been , which may be a little challenging considering your guys &apos; credentials .
But the way progress happens is because new generations and new eras grow and develop and become better than the previous ones .
It &apos;s the reason we &apos;re not in the Dark Ages anymore .
No matter your position or place in life , it is imperative to create opportunities for children so that we can grow up to blow you away .
Adults and fellow TEDsters , you need to listen and learn from kids and trust us and expect more from us .
You must lend an ear today , because we are the leaders of tomorrow , which means we &apos;re going to be taking care of you when you &apos;re old and senile . No , just kidding .
No , really , we are going to be the next generation , the ones who will bring this world forward .
And in case you don &apos;t think that this really has meaning for you , remember that cloning is possible , and that involves going through childhood again , in which case you &apos;ll want to be heard just like my generation .
Now , the world needs opportunities for new leaders and new ideas .
Kids need opportunities to lead and succeed .
Are you ready to make the match ?
Because the world &apos;s problems shouldn &apos;t be the human family &apos;s heirloom .
Thank you .
Thank you . Thank you .

&lt; url &gt; http : / / www.ted.com / talks / terry _ moore _ why _ is _ x _ the _ unknown.html &lt; / url &gt;
I have the answer to a question that we &apos;ve all asked .
The question is , Why is it that the letter X represents the unknown ?
Now I know we learned that in math class , but now it &apos;s everywhere in the culture -- The X prize , the X-Files , Project X , TEDx .
Where &apos;d that come from ?
About six years ago I decided that I would learn Arabic , which turns out to be a supremely logical language .
To write a word or a phrase or a sentence in Arabic is like crafting an equation , because every part is extremely precise and carries a lot of information .
That &apos;s one of the reasons so much of what we &apos;ve come to think of as Western science and mathematics and engineering was really worked out in the first few centuries of the Common Era by the Persians and the Arabs and the Turks .
This includes the little system in Arabic called al-jebra .
And al-jebr roughly translates to &quot; the system for reconciling disparate parts . &quot;
Al-jebr finally came into English as algebra .
One example among many .
The Arabic texts containing this mathematical wisdom finally made their way to Europe -- which is to say Spain -- in the 11th and 12th centuries .
And when they arrived there was tremendous interest in translating this wisdom into a European language .
But there were problems .
One problem is there are some sounds in Arabic that just don &apos;t make it through a European voice box without lots of practice .
Trust me on that one .
Also , those very sounds tend not to be represented by the characters that are available in European languages .
Here &apos;s one of the culprits .
This is the letter SHeen , and it makes the sound we think of as SH -- &quot; sh . &quot;
It &apos;s also the very first letter of the word shalan , which means &quot; something &quot; just like the the English word &quot; something &quot; -- some undefined , unknown thing .
Now in Arabic , we can make this definite by adding the definite article &quot; al . &quot;
So this is al-shalan -- the unknown thing .
And this is a word that appears throughout early mathematics , such as this 10th century derivation of proofs .
The problem for the Medieval Spanish scholars who were tasked with translating this material is that the letter SHeen and the word shalan can &apos;t be rendered into Spanish because Spanish doesn &apos;t have that SH , that &quot; sh &quot; sound .
So by convention , they created a rule in which they borrowed the CK sound , &quot; ck &quot; sound , from the classical Greek in the form of the letter Kai .
Later when this material was translated into a common European language , which is to say Latin , they simply replaced the Greek Kai with the Latin X.
And once that happened , once this material was in Latin , it formed the basis for mathematics textbooks for almost 600 years .
But now we have the answer to our question .
Why is it that X is the unknown ?
X is the unknown because you can &apos;t say &quot; sh &quot; in Spanish .
And I thought that was worth sharing .

So I &apos;m a doctor , but I kind of slipped sideways into research , and now I &apos;m an epidemiologist .
And nobody really knows what epidemiology is .
Epidemiology is the science of how we know in the real world if something is good for you or bad for you .
And it &apos;s best understood through example as the science of those crazy , wacky newspaper headlines .
And these are just some of the examples .
These are from the Daily Mail . Every country in the world has a newspaper like this .
It has this bizarre , ongoing philosophical project of dividing all the inanimate objects in the world into the ones that either cause or prevent cancer .
So here are some of the things they said cause cancer recently : divorce , Wi-Fi , toiletries and coffee .
Here are some of the things they say prevents cancer : crusts , red pepper , licorice and coffee .
So already you can see there are contradictions .
Coffee both causes and prevents cancer .
And as you start to read on , you can see that maybe there &apos;s some kind of political valence behind some of this .
So for women , housework prevents breast cancer , but for men , shopping could make you impotent .
So we know that we need to start unpicking the science behind this .
And what I hope to show is that unpicking dodgy claims , unpicking the evidence behind dodgy claims , isn &apos;t a kind of nasty carping activity ; it &apos;s socially useful , but it &apos;s also an extremely valuable explanatory tool .
Because real science is all about critically appraising the evidence for somebody else &apos;s position .
That &apos;s what happens in academic journals .
That &apos;s what happens at academic conferences .
The Q &amp; amp ; A session after a post-op presents data is often a blood bath .
And nobody minds that . We actively welcome it .
It &apos;s like a consenting intellectual S &amp; amp ; M activity .
So what I &apos;m going to show you is all of the main things , all of the main features of my discipline -- evidence-based medicine .
And I will talk you through all of these and demonstrate how they work , exclusively using examples of people getting stuff wrong .
So we &apos;ll start with the absolute weakest form of evidence known to man , and that is authority .
In science , we don &apos;t care how many letters you have after your name .
In science , we want to know what your reasons are for believing something .
How do you know that something is good for us or bad for us ?
But we &apos;re also unimpressed by authority , because it &apos;s so easy to contrive .
This is somebody called Dr. Gillian McKeith Ph.D , or , to give her full medical title , Gillian McKeith .
Again , every country has somebody like this .
She is our TV diet guru .
She has massive five series of prime-time television , giving out very lavish and exotic health advice .
She , it turns out , has a non-accredited correspondence course Ph.D.
from somewhere in America .
She also boasts that she &apos;s a certified professional member of the American Association of Nutritional Consultants , which sounds very glamorous and exciting .
You get a certificate and everything .
This one belongs to my dead cat Hetti . She was a horrible cat .
You just go to the website , fill out the form , give them $ 60 , and it arrives in the post .
Now that &apos;s not the only reason that we think this person is an idiot .
She also goes and says things like , you should eat lots of dark green leaves , because they contain lots of chlorophyll , and that will really oxygenate your blood .
And anybody who &apos;s done school biology remembers that chlorophyll and chloroplasts only make oxygen in sunlight , and it &apos;s quite dark in your bowels after you &apos;ve eaten spinach .
Next , we need proper science , proper evidence .
So , &quot; Red wine can help prevent breast cancer . &quot;
This is a headline from the Daily Telegraph in the U.K.
&quot; A glass of red wine a day could help prevent breast cancer . &quot;
So you go and find this paper , and what you find is it is a real piece of science .
It is a description of the changes in one enzyme when you drip a chemical extracted from some red grape skin onto some cancer cells in a dish on a bench in a laboratory somewhere .
And that &apos;s a really useful thing to describe in a scientific paper , but on the question of your own personal risk of getting breast cancer if you drink red wine , it tells you absolutely bugger all .
Actually , it turns out that your risk of breast cancer actually increases slightly with every amount of alcohol that you drink .
So what we want is studies in real human people .
And here &apos;s another example .
This is from Britain &apos;s leading diet and nutritionist in the Daily Mirror , which is our second biggest selling newspaper .
&quot; An Australian study in 2001 found that olive oil in combination with fruits , vegetables and pulses offers measurable protection against skin wrinklings . &quot;
And then they give you advice : &quot; If you eat olive oil and vegetables , you &apos;ll have fewer skin wrinkles . &quot;
And they very helpfully tell you how to go and find the paper .
So you go and find the paper , and what you find is an observational study .
Obviously nobody has been able to go back to 1930 , get all the people born in one maternity unit , and half of them eat lots of fruit and veg and olive oil , and then half of them eat McDonald &apos;s , and then we see how many wrinkles you &apos;ve got later .
You have to take a snapshot of how people are now .
And what you find is , of course , people who eat veg and olive oil have fewer skin wrinkles .
But that &apos;s because people who eat fruit and veg and olive oil , they &apos;re freaks , they &apos;re not normal , they &apos;re like you ; they come to events like this .
They are posh , they &apos;re wealthy , they &apos;re less likely to have outdoor jobs , they &apos;re less likely to do manual labor , they have better social support , they &apos;re less likely to smoke -- so for a whole host of fascinating , interlocking social , political and cultural reasons , they are less likely to have skin wrinkles .
That doesn &apos;t mean that it &apos;s the vegetables or the olive oil .
So ideally what you want to do is a trial .
And everybody thinks they &apos;re very familiar with the idea of a trial .
Trials are very old . The first trial was in the Bible -- Daniel 1 : 12 .
It &apos;s very straightforward -- you take a bunch of people , you split them in half , you treat one group one way , you treat the other group the other way , and a little while later , you follow them up and see what happened to each of them .
So I &apos;m going to tell you about one trial , which is probably the most well-reported trial in the U.K. news media over the past decade .
And this is the trial of fish oil pills .
And the claim was fish oil pills improve school performance and behavior in mainstream children .
And they said , &quot; We &apos;ve done a trial .
All the previous trials were positive , and we know this one &apos;s gonna be too . &quot;
That should always ring alarm bells .
Because if you already know the answer to your trial , you shouldn &apos;t be doing one .
Either you &apos;ve rigged it by design , or you &apos;ve got enough data so there &apos;s no need to randomize people anymore .
So this is what they were going to do in their trial .
They were taking 3,000 children , they were going to give them all these huge fish oil pills , six of them a day , and then a year later , they were going to measure their school exam performance and compare their school exam performance against what they predicted their exam performance would have been if they hadn &apos;t had the pills .
Now can anybody spot a flaw in this design ?
And no professors of clinical trial methodology are allowed to answer this question .
So there &apos;s no control ; there &apos;s no control group .
But that sounds really techie .
That &apos;s a technical term .
The kids got the pills , and then their performance improved .
What else could it possibly be if it wasn &apos;t the pills ?
They got older . We all develop over time .
And of course , also there &apos;s the placebo effect .
The placebo effect is one of the most fascinating things in the whole of medicine .
It &apos;s not just about taking a pill , and your performance and your pain getting better .
It &apos;s about our beliefs and expectations .
It &apos;s about the cultural meaning of a treatment .
And this has been demonstrated in a whole raft of fascinating studies comparing one kind of placebo against another .
So we know , for example , that two sugar pills a day are a more effective treatment for getting rid of gastric ulcers than one sugar pill .
Two sugar pills a day beats one sugar pill a day .
And that &apos;s an outrageous and ridiculous finding , but it &apos;s true .
We know from three different studies on three different types of pain that a saltwater injection is a more effective treatment for pain than taking a sugar pill , taking a dummy pill that has no medicine in it -- not because the injection or the pills do anything physically to the body , but because an injection feels like a much more dramatic intervention .
So we know that our beliefs and expectations can be manipulated , which is why we do trials where we control against a placebo -- where one half of the people get the real treatment and the other half get placebo .
But that &apos;s not enough .
What I &apos;ve just shown you are examples of the very simple and straightforward ways that journalists and food supplement pill peddlers and naturopaths can distort evidence for their own purposes .
What I find really fascinating is that the pharmaceutical industry uses exactly the same kinds of tricks and devices , but slightly more sophisticated versions of them , in order to distort the evidence that they give to doctors and patients , and which we use to make vitally important decisions .
So firstly , trials against placebo : everybody thinks they know that a trial should be a comparison of your new drug against placebo .
But actually in a lot of situations that &apos;s wrong .
Because often we already have a very good treatment that is currently available , so we don &apos;t want to know that your alternative new treatment is better than nothing .
We want to know that it &apos;s better than the best currently available treatment that we have .
And yet , repeatedly , you consistently see people doing trials still against placebo .
And you can get license to bring your drug to market with only data showing that it &apos;s better than nothing , which is useless for a doctor like me trying to make a decision .
But that &apos;s not the only way you can rig your data .
You can also rig your data by making the thing you compare your new drug against really rubbish .
You can give the competing drug in too low a dose , so that people aren &apos;t properly treated .
You can give the competing drug in too high a dose , so that people get side effects .
And this is exactly what happened which antipsychotic medication for schizophrenia .
20 years ago , a new generation of antipsychotic drugs were brought in and the promise was that they would have fewer side effects .
So people set about doing trials of these new drugs against the old drugs , but they gave the old drugs in ridiculously high doses -- 20 milligrams a day of haloperidol .
And it &apos;s a foregone conclusion , if you give a drug at that high a dose , that it will have more side effects and that your new drug will look better .
10 years ago , history repeated itself , interestingly , when risperidone , which was the first of the new-generation antipscyhotic drugs , came off copyright , so anybody could make copies .
Everybody wanted to show that their drug was better than risperidone , so you see a bunch of trials comparing new antipsychotic drugs against risperidone at eight milligrams a day .
Again , not an insane dose , not an illegal dose , but very much at the high end of normal .
And so you &apos;re bound to make your new drug look better .
And so it &apos;s no surprise that overall , industry-funded trials are four times more likely to give a positive result than independently sponsored trials .
But -- and it &apos;s a big but -- it turns out , when you look at the methods used by industry-funded trials , that they &apos;re actually better than independently sponsored trials .
And yet , they always manage to to get the result that they want .
So how does this work ?
How can we explain this strange phenomenon ?
Well it turns out that what happens is the negative data goes missing in action ; it &apos;s withheld from doctors and patients .
And this is the most important aspect of the whole story .
It &apos;s at the top of the pyramid of evidence .
We need to have all of the data on a particular treatment to know whether or not it really is effective .
And there are two different ways that you can spot whether some data has gone missing in action .
You can use statistics , or you can use stories .
I personally prefer statistics , so that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to do first .
This is something called funnel plot .
And a funnel plot is a very clever way of spotting if small negative trials have disappeared , have gone missing in action .
So this is a graph of all of the trials that have been done on a particular treatment .
And as you go up towards the top of the graph , what you see is each dot is a trial .
And as you go up , those are the bigger trials , so they &apos;ve got less error in them .
So they &apos;re less likely to be randomly false positives , randomly false negatives .
So they all cluster together .
The big trials are closer to the true answer .
Then as you go further down at the bottom , what you can see is , over on this side , the spurious false negatives , and over on this side , the spurious false positives .
If there is publication bias , if small negative trials have gone missing in action , you can see it on one of these graphs .
So you can see here that the small negative trials that should be on the bottom left have disappeared .
This is a graph demonstrating the presence of publication bias in studies of publication bias .
And I think that &apos;s the funniest epidemiology joke that you will ever hear .
That &apos;s how you can prove it statistically , but what about stories ?
Well they &apos;re heinous , they really are .
This is a drug called reboxetine .
This is a drug that I myself have prescribed to patients .
And I &apos;m a very nerdy doctor .
I hope I try to go out of my way to try and read and understand all the literature .
I read the trials on this . They were all positive . They were all well-conducted .
I found no flaw .
Unfortunately , it turned out , that many of these trials were withheld .
In fact , 76 percent of all of the trials that were done on this drug were withheld from doctors and patients .
if I tossed a coin a hundred times , and I &apos;m allowed to withhold from you the answers half the times , then I can convince you that I have a coin with two heads .
If we remove half of the data , we can never know what the true effect size of these medicines is .
And this is not an isolated story .
Around half of all of the trial data on antidepressants has been withheld , but it goes way beyond that .
The Nordic Cochrane Group were trying to get a hold of the data on that to bring it all together .
The Cochrane Groups are an international nonprofit collaboration that produce systematic reviews of all of the data that has ever been shown .
And they need to have access to all of the trial data .
But the companies withheld that data from them , and so did the European Medicines Agency for three years .
This is a problem that is currently lacking a solution .
And to show how big it goes , this is a drug called Tamiflu , which governments around the world have spent billions and billions of dollars on .
And they spend that money on the promise that this is a drug which will reduce the rate of complications with flu .
We already have the data showing that it reduces the duration of your flu by a few hours .
But I don &apos;t really care about that . Governments don &apos;t care about that .
I &apos;m very sorry if you have the flu , I know it &apos;s horrible , but we &apos;re not going to spend billions of dollars trying to reduce the duration of your flu symptoms by half a day .
We prescribe these drugs , we stockpile them for emergencies on the understanding that they will reduce the number of complications , which means pneumonia and which means death .
The infectious diseases Cochrane Group , which are based in Italy , has been trying to get the full data in a usable form out of the drug companies so that they can make a full decision about whether this drug is effective or not , and they &apos;ve not been able to get that information .
This is undoubtedly the single biggest ethical problem facing medicine today .
We cannot make decisions in the absence of all of the information .
So it &apos;s a little bit difficult from there to spin in some kind of positive conclusion .
But I would say this : I think that sunlight is the best disinfectant .
All of these things are happening in plain sight , and they &apos;re all protected by a force field of tediousness .
And I think , with all of the problems in science , one of the best things that we can do is to lift up the lid , finger around in the mechanics and peer in .
Thank you very much .

&lt; url &gt; http : / / www.ted.com / talks / gever _ tulley _ on _ 5 _ dangerous _ things _ for _ kids.html &lt; / url &gt;
Welcome to &quot; Five Dangerous Things You Should Let Your Children Do . &quot;
I don &apos;t have children .
I borrow my friends &apos; children , so take all this advice with a grain of salt .
I &apos;m Gever Tulley .
I &apos;m a contract computer scientist by trade , but I &apos;m the founder of something called the Tinkering School .
It &apos;s a summer program which aims to help kids to learn how to build the things that they think of .
So we build a lot of things .
And I do put power tools into the hands of second-graders .
So if you &apos;re thinking about sending your kid to Tinkering School , they do come back bruised , scraped and bloody .
So , you know , we live in a world that &apos;s subjected to ever more stringent child safety regulations .
There doesn &apos;t seem to be any limit on how crazy child safety regulations can get .
We put suffocation warnings on all the -- on every piece of plastic film manufactured in the United States or for sale with an item in the United States .
We put warnings on coffee cups to tell us that the contents may be hot .
And we seem to think that any item sharper than a golf ball is too sharp for children under the age of 10 .
So where does this trend stop ?
When we round every corner and eliminate every sharp object , every pokey bit in the world , then the first time that kids come in contact with anything sharp or not made out of round plastic , they &apos;ll hurt themselves with it .
So , as the boundaries of what we determine as the safety zone grow ever smaller , we cut off our children from valuable opportunities to learn how to interact with the world around them .
And despite all of our best efforts and intentions , kids are always going to figure out how to do the most dangerous thing they can , in whatever environment they can .
So despite the provocative title , this presentation is really about safety and about some simple things that we can do to raise our kids to be creative , confident and in control of the environment around them .
And what I now present to you is an excerpt from a book in progress .
The book is called &quot; 50 Dangerous Things . &quot;
This is five dangerous things .
Thing number one -- play with fire .
Learning to control one of the most elemental forces in nature is a pivotal moment in any child &apos;s personal history .
Whether we remember it or not , it &apos;s a -- it &apos;s the first time we really get control of one of these mysterious things .
These mysteries are only revealed to those who get the opportunity to play with it .
So , playing with fire .
This is like one of the great things we ever discovered , fire .
From playing with it , they learn some basic principles about fire , about intake , about combustion , about exhaust .
These are the three working elements of fire that you have to have to have a good controlled fire .
And you can think of the open-pit fire as a laboratory .
You don &apos;t know what they &apos;re going to learn from playing with it .
You know , let them fool around with it on their own terms and trust me , they &apos;re going to learn things that you can &apos;t get out of playing with Dora the Explorer toys .
Number two -- own a pocketknife .
Pocketknives are kind of drifting out of our cultural consciousness , which I think is a terrible thing .
Your first -- your first pocketknife is like the first universal tool that you &apos;re given .
You know , it &apos;s a spatula , it &apos;s a pry bar , it &apos;s a screwdriver and it &apos;s a blade .
And it &apos;s a -- it &apos;s a powerful and empowering tool .
And in a lot of cultures they give knives -- like , as soon as they &apos;re toddlers they have knives .
These are Inuit children cutting whale blubber .
I first saw this in a Canadian Film Board film when I was 10 , and it left a lasting impression , to see babies playing with knives .
And it shows that kids can develop an extended sense of self through a tool at a very young age .
You lay down a couple of very simple rules -- always cut away from your body , keep the blade sharp , never force it -- and these are things kids can understand and practice with .
And yeah , they &apos;re going to cut themselves .
I have some terrible scars on my legs from where I stabbed myself .
But you know , they &apos;re young . They heal fast .
Number three -- throw a spear .
It turns out that our brains are actually wired for throwing things and , like muscles , if you don &apos;t use parts of your brain , they tend to atrophy over time .
But when you exercise them , any given muscle adds strength to the whole system and that applies to your brain too .
So practicing throwing things has been shown to stimulate the frontal and parietal lobes , which have to do with visual acuity , 3D understanding , and structural problem solving , so it gives a sense -- it helps develop their visualization skills and their predictive ability .
And throwing is a combination of analytical and physical skill , so it &apos;s very good for that kind of whole-body training .
These kinds of target-based practice also helps kids develop attention and concentration skills .
So those are great .
Number four -- deconstruct appliances .
There is a world of interesting things inside your dishwasher .
Next time you &apos;re about to throw out an appliance , don &apos;t throw it out .
Take it apart with your kid , or send him to my school and we &apos;ll take it apart with them .
Even if you don &apos;t know what the parts are , puzzling out what they might be for is a really good practice for the kids to get sort of the sense that they can take things apart , and no matter how complex they are , they can understand parts of them and that means that eventually , they can understand all of them .
It &apos;s a sense of knowability , that something is knowable .
So these black boxes that we live with and take for granted are actually complex things made by other people and you can understand them .
Number five -- two-parter .
Break the Digital Millennium Copyright Act .
There are laws beyond safety regulations that attempt to limit how we can interact with the things that we own -- in this case , digital media .
It &apos;s a very simple exercise -- buy a song on ITunes , write it to a CD , then rip the CD to an MP3 and play it on your very same computer .
You &apos;ve just broken a law .
Technically the RIAA can come and persecute you .
It &apos;s an important lesson for kids to understand -- that some of these laws get broken by accident and that laws have to be interpreted .
And it &apos;s something we often talk about with the kids when we &apos;re fooling around with things and breaking them open and taking them apart and using them for other things -- and also when we go out and drive a car .
Driving a car is a -- is a really empowering act for a young child , so this is the ultimate .
For those of you who aren &apos;t comfortable actually breaking the law , you can drive a car with your child .
This is -- this is a great stage for a kid .
This happens about the same time that they get latched onto things like dinosaurs , these big things in the outside world that they &apos;re trying to get a grip on .
A car is a similar object , and they can get in a car and drive it .
And that &apos;s a really , like -- it gives them a handle on a world in a way that they wouldn &apos;t -- that they don &apos;t often have access to .
So -- and it &apos;s perfectly legal .
Find a big empty lot , make sure there &apos;s nothing in it and it &apos;s on private property , and let them drive your car .
It &apos;s very safe actually .
And it &apos;s fun for the whole family .
So , let &apos;s see .
I think that &apos;s it . That &apos;s number five and a half . OK .

As a magician , I &apos;m always interested in performances that incorporate elements of illusion .
And one of the most remarkable was the tanagra theater , which was popular in the early part of the 20th century .
It used mirrors to create the illusion of tiny people performing on a miniature stage . Now , I won &apos;t use mirrors , but this is my digital tribute to the tanagra theater .
So let the story begin .
On a dark and stormy night -- really ! -- it was the 10th of July , 1856 .
Lightning lit the sky , and a baby was born .
His name was Nikola , Nikola Tesla .
Now the baby grew into a very smart guy .
Let me show you .
Tesla , what is 236 multiplied by 501 ?
Nikola Tesla : The result is 118,236 .
Marco Tempest : Now Tesla &apos;s brain worked in the most extraordinary way .
When a word was mentioned , an image of it instantly appeared in his mind .
Tree . Chair . Girl .
They were hallucinations , which vanished the moment he touched them .
Probably a form of synesthesia .
But it was something he later turned to his advantage .
Where other scientists would play in their laboratory , Tesla created his inventions in his mind .
NT : To my delight , I discovered I could visualize my inventions with the greatest facility .
MT : And when they worked in the vivid playground of his imagination , he would build them in his workshop .
NT : I needed no models , drawings or experiments .
I could picture them as real in my mind , and there I run it , test it and improve it .
Only then do I construct it .
MT : His great idea was alternating current .
But how could he convince the public that the millions of volts required to make it work were safe ?
To sell his idea , he became a showman .
NT : We are at the dawn of a new age , the age of electricity .
I have been able , through careful invention , to transmit , with the mere flick of a switch , electricity across the ether .
It is the magic of science .
Tesla has over 700 patents to his name : radio , wireless telegraphy , remote control , robotics .
He even photographed the bones of the human body .
But the high point was the realization of a childhood dream : harnessing the raging powers of Niagara Falls , and bringing light to the city .
But Tesla &apos;s success didn &apos;t last .
NT : I had bigger ideas .
Illuminating the city was only the beginning .
A world telegraphy center -- imagine news , messages , sounds , images delivered to any point in the world instantly and wirelessly .
MT : It &apos;s a great idea ; it was a huge project . Expensive , too .
NT : They wouldn &apos;t give me the money .
MT : Well , maybe you shouldn &apos;t have told them it could be used to contact other planets .
NT : Yes , that was a big mistake .
MT : Tesla &apos;s career as an inventor never recovered .
He became a recluse .
Dodged by death , he spent much of his time in his suite at the Waldorf-Astoria .
NT : Everything I did , I did for mankind , for a world where there would be no humiliation of the poor by the violence of the rich , where products of intellect , science and art will serve society for the betterment and beautification of life .
MT : Nikola Tesla died on the 7th of January , 1943 .
His final resting place is a golden globe that contains his ashes at the Nikola Tesla Museum in Belgrade .
His legacy is with us still .
Tesla became the man who lit the world , but this was only the beginning .
Tesla &apos;s insight was profound .
NT : Tell me , what will man do when the forests disappear , and the coal deposits are exhausted ?
MT : Tesla thought he had the answer .
We are still asking the question .
Thank you .

This is a work in process , based on some comments that were made at TED two years ago about the need for the storage of vaccine .
On this planet , 1.6 billion people don &apos;t have access to electricity , refrigeration or stored fuels .
This is a problem .
It impacts : the spread of disease , the storage of food and medicine and the quality of life .
So here &apos;s the plan : inexpensive refrigeration that doesn &apos;t use electricity , propane , gas , kerosene or consumables .
Time for some thermodynamics .
And the story of the Intermittent Absorption Refrigerator .
Adam Grosser : So 29 years ago , I had this thermo teacher who talked about absorption and refrigeration .
It &apos;s one of those things that stuck in my head .
It was a lot like the Stirling engine : it was cool , but you didn &apos;t know what to do with it .
And it was invented in 1858 , by this guy Ferdinand Carre , but he couldn &apos;t actually build anything with it because of the tools of the time .
This crazy Canadian named Powel Crosley commercialized this thing called the IcyBall in 1928 , and it was a really neat idea , and I &apos;ll get to why it didn &apos;t work , but here &apos;s how it works .
There &apos;s two spheres and they &apos;re separated in distance .
One has a working fluid , water and ammonia , and the other is a condenser .
You heat up one side , the hot side .
The ammonia evaporates and it re-condenses in the other side .
You let it cool to room temperature , and then , as the ammonia re-evaporates and combines with the water back on the erstwhile hot side , it creates a powerful cooling effect .
So , it was a great idea that didn &apos;t work at all : it blew up .
Because using ammonia you get hugely high pressures if you heated them wrong .
It topped 400 psi . The ammonia was toxic . It sprayed everywhere .
But it was kind of an interesting thought .
So , the great thing about 2006 is there &apos;s a lot of really great computational work you can do .
So , we got the whole thermodynamics department at Stanford involved -- a lot of computational fluid dynamics .
We proved that most of the ammonia refrigeration tables are wrong .
We found some non-toxic refrigerants that worked at very low vapor pressures .
Brought in a team from the U.K. -- there &apos;s a lot of great refrigeration people , it turned out , in the U.K. -- and built a test rig , and proved that , in fact , we could make a low pressure , non-toxic refrigerator .
So , this is the way it works .
You put it on a cooking fire .
Most people have cooking fires in the world , whether it &apos;s camel dung or wood .
It heats up for about 30 minutes , cools for an hour .
Put it into a container and it will refrigerate for 24 hours .
It looks like this . This is the fifth prototype . It &apos;s not quite done .
Weighs about eight pounds , and this is the way it works .
You put it into a 15-liter vessel , about three gallons , and it &apos;ll cool it down to just above freezing -- three degrees above freezing -- for 24 hours in a 30 degree C environment . It &apos;s really cheap .
We think we can build these in high volumes for about 25 dollars , in low volumes for about 40 dollars .
And we think we can make refrigeration something that everybody can have .
Thank you .

&lt; url &gt; http : / / www.ted.com / talks / jason _ fried _ why _ work _ doesn _ t _ happen _ at _ work.html &lt; / url &gt;
So I &apos;m going to talk about work , specifically why people can &apos;t seem to get work done at work , which is a problem we all kind of have .
But let &apos;s , sort of , start at the beginning .
So we have companies and non-profits and charities and all these groups that have employees or volunteers of some sort .
And they expect these people who work for them to do great work -- I would hope , at least .
At least good work , hopefully , at least it &apos;s good work -- hopefully great work .
And so what they typically do is they decide that all these people need to come together in one place to do that work .
So a company , or a charity , or an organization of any kind , they typically -- unless you &apos;re working in Africa , if you &apos;re really lucky to do that -- most people have to go to an office every day .
And so these companies , they build offices .
They go out and they buy a building , or they rent a building , or they lease some space , and they fill the space with stuff .
They fill it with tables , or desks , chairs , computer equipment , software , Internet access , maybe a fridge , maybe a few other things , and they expect their employees , or their volunteers , to come to that location every day to do great work .
It seems like it &apos;s perfectly reasonable to ask that .
However , if you actually talk to people and even question yourself , and you ask yourself , where do you really want to go when you really need to get something done ?
You &apos;ll find out that people don &apos;t say what businesses think they would say .
If you ask people the question : where do you really need to go when you need to get something done ?
Typically you get three different kinds of answers .
One is kind of a place or a location or a room .
Another one is a moving object and a third is a time .
So here &apos;s some examples .
When I ask people -- and I &apos;ve been asking people this question for about 10 years -- I ask them , &quot; Where do you go when you really need to get something done ? &quot;
I &apos;ll hear things like , the porch , the deck , the kitchen .
I &apos;ll hear things like an extra room in the house , the basement , the coffee shop , the library .
And then you &apos;ll hear things like the train , a plane , a car -- so , the commute .
And then you &apos;ll hear people say , &quot; Well , it doesn &apos;t really matter where I am , as long as it &apos;s really early in the morning or really late at night or on the weekends . &quot;
You almost never hear someone say the office .
But businesses are spending all this money on this place called the office , and they &apos;re making people go to it all the time , yet people don &apos;t do work in the office .
What is that about ?
Why is that ?
Why is that happening ?
And what you find out is that , if you dig a little bit deeper , you find out that people -- this is what happens -- people go to work , and they &apos;re basically trading in their workday for a series of &quot; work moments . &quot;
That &apos;s what happens at the office .
You don &apos;t have a workday anymore . You have work moments .
It &apos;s like the front door of the office is like a Cuisinart , and you walk in and your day is shredded to bits , because you have 15 minutes here and 30 minutes there , and then something else happens and you &apos;re pulled off your work , and you &apos;ve got to do something else , then you have 20 minutes , then it &apos;s lunch .
Then you have something else to do .
Then you &apos;ve got 15 minutes , and someone pulls you aside and asks you this question , and before you know it , it &apos;s 5 p.m. , and you look back on the day , and you realize that you didn &apos;t get anything done .
I mean , we &apos;ve all been through this .
We probably went through it yesterday , or the day before , or the day before that .
You look back on your day , and you &apos;re like , I got nothing done today .
I was at work .
I sat at my desk . I used my expensive computer .
I used the software they told me to use .
I went to these meetings I was asked to go to .
I did these conference calls . I did all this stuff .
But I didn &apos;t actually do anything .
I just did tasks .
I didn &apos;t actually get meaningful work done .
And what you find is that , especially with creative people -- designers , programmers , writers , engineers , thinkers -- that people really need long stretches of uninterrupted time to get something done .
You cannot ask somebody to be creative in 15 minutes and really think about a problem .
You might have a quick idea , but to be in deep thought about a problem and really consider a problem carefully , you need long stretches of uninterrupted time .
And even though the workday is typically eight hours , how many people here have ever had eight hours to themselves at the office ?
How about seven hours ?
Six ? Five ? Four ?
When &apos;s the last time you had three hours to yourself at the office ?
Two hours ? One , maybe ?
Very , very few people actually have long stretches of uninterrupted time at an office .
And this is why people choose to do work at home , or they might go to the office , but they might go to the office really early in the day , or late at night when no one &apos;s around , or they stick around after everyone &apos;s left , or they go in on the weekends , or they get work done on the plane , or they get work done in the car or in the train because there are no distractions .
Now , there are different kinds of distractions , but there aren &apos;t the really bad kinds of distractions that I &apos;ll talk about in just a minute .
And this sort of whole phenomenon of having short bursts of time to get things done reminds me of another thing that doesn &apos;t work when you &apos;re interrupted , and that is sleep .
I think that sleep and work are very closely related , and it &apos;s not just that you can work while you &apos;re sleeping and you can sleep while you &apos;re working .
That &apos;s not really what I mean .
I &apos;m talking specifically about the fact that sleep and work are phased-based , or stage-based , events .
So sleep is about sleep phases , or stages -- some people call them different things .
There &apos;s five of them , and in order to get to the really deep ones , the really meaningful ones , you have to go through the early ones .
And if you &apos;re interrupted while you &apos;re going through the early ones -- if someone bumps you in bed , or if there &apos;s a sound , or whatever happens -- you don &apos;t just pick up where you left off .
If you &apos;re interrupted and woken up , you have to start again .
So you have to go back a few phases and start again .
And what ends up happening -- sometimes you might have days like this where you wake up at eight in the morning , or seven in the morning , or whenever you get up , and you &apos;re like , man , I didn &apos;t really sleep very well .
I did the sleep thing -- I went to bed , I laid down -- but I didn &apos;t really sleep .
People say you go to sleep , but you really don &apos;t go to sleep , you go towards sleep .
It just takes a while . You &apos;ve got to go through these phases and stuff , and if you &apos;re interrupted , you don &apos;t sleep well .
So how do we expect -- does anyone here expect someone to sleep well if they &apos;re interrupted all night ?
I don &apos;t think anyone would say yes .
Why do we expect people to work well if they &apos;re being interrupted all day at the office ?
How can we possibly expect people to do their job if they &apos;re going to the office to be interrupted ?
That doesn &apos;t really seem like it makes a lot of sense to me .
So what are these interruptions that happen at the office that don &apos;t happen at other places ?
Because in other places , you can have interruptions , like , you can have the TV , or you could go for a walk , or there &apos;s a fridge downstairs , or you &apos;ve got your own couch , or whatever you want to do .
And if you talk to certain managers , they &apos;ll tell you that they don &apos;t want their employees to work at home because of these distractions .
They &apos;ll also say -- sometimes they &apos;ll also say , &quot; Well , if I can &apos;t see the person , how do I know they &apos;re working ? &quot;
which is ridiculous , of course , but that &apos;s one of the excuses that managers give .
And I &apos;m one of these managers .
I understand . I know how this goes .
We all have to improve on this sort of thing .
But oftentimes they &apos;ll cite distractions .
&quot; I can &apos;t let someone work at home .
They &apos;ll watch TV . They &apos;ll do this other thing . &quot;
It turns out that those aren &apos;t the things that are really distracting .
Because those are voluntary distractions .
You decide when you want to be distracted by the TV .
You decide when you want to turn something on .
You decide when you want to go downstairs or go for a walk .
At the office , most of the interruptions and distractions that really cause people not to get work done are involuntary .
So let &apos;s go through a couple of those .
Now , managers and bosses will often have you think that the real distractions at work are things like Facebook and Twitter and YouTube and other websites , and in fact , they &apos;ll go so far as to actually ban these sites at work .
Some of you may work at places where you can &apos;t get to these certain sites .
I mean , is this China ? What the hell is going on here ?
You can &apos;t go to a website at work , and that &apos;s the problem , that &apos;s why people aren &apos;t getting work done , because they &apos;re going to Facebook and they &apos;re going to Twitter ?
That &apos;s kind of ridiculous . It &apos;s a total decoy .
And today &apos;s Facebook and Twitter and YouTube , these things are just modern-day smoke breaks .
No one cared about letting people take a smoke break for 15 minutes 10 years ago , so why does everyone care about someone going to Facebook here and there , or Twitter here and there , or YouTube here and there ?
Those aren &apos;t the real problems in the office .
The real problems are what I like to call the M &amp; amp ; Ms , the Managers and the Meetings .
Those are the real problems in the modern office today .
And this is why things don &apos;t get done at work -- it &apos;s because of the M &amp; amp ; Ms.
Now what &apos;s interesting is , if you listen to all the places that people talk about doing work -- like at home , or in a car , or on a plane , or late at night , or early in the morning -- you don &apos;t find managers and meetings .
You find a lot of other distractions , but you don &apos;t find managers and meetings .
So these are the things that you don &apos;t find elsewhere , but you do find at the office .
And managers are basically people whose job it is to interrupt people .
That &apos;s pretty much what managers are for . They &apos;re for interrupting people .
They don &apos;t really do the work , so they have to make sure everyone else is doing the work , which is an interruption .
And we have a lot of managers in the world now , and there &apos;s a lot of people in the world now , and there &apos;s a lot of interruptions in the world now because of these managers .
They have to check in : &quot; Hey , how &apos;s it going ?
Show me what &apos;s up , &quot; and this sort of thing and they keep interrupting you at the wrong time , while you &apos;re actually trying to do something they &apos;re paying you to do , they tend to interrupt you .
That &apos;s kind of bad .
But what &apos;s even worse is the thing that managers do most of all , which is call meetings .
And meetings are just toxic , terrible , poisonous things during the day at work .
We all know this to be true , and you would never see a spontaneous meeting called by employees .
It doesn &apos;t work that way .
The manager calls the meeting so the employees can all come together , and it &apos;s an incredibly disruptive thing to do to people -- is to say , &quot; Hey look , we &apos;re going to bring 10 people together right now and have a meeting .
I don &apos;t care what you &apos;re doing .
Just , you &apos;ve got to stop doing what you &apos;re doing , so you can have this meeting . &quot;
I mean , what are the chances that all 10 people are ready to stop ?
What if they &apos;re thinking about something important ?
What if they &apos;re doing important work ?
All of a sudden you &apos;re telling them that they have to stop doing that to do something else .
So they go into a meeting room , they get together , and they talk about stuff that doesn &apos;t really matter usually .
Because meetings aren &apos;t work .
Meetings are places to go to talk about things you &apos;re supposed to be doing later .
But meetings also procreate .
So one meeting tends to lead to another meeting and tends to lead to another meeting .
There &apos;s often too many people in the meetings , and they &apos;re very , very expensive to the organization .
Companies often think of a one-hour meeting as a one-hour meeting , but that &apos;s not true , unless there &apos;s only one person in that meeting .
If there are 10 people in the meeting , it &apos;s a 10-hour meeting ; it &apos;s not a one-hour meeting .
It &apos;s 10 hours of productivity taken from the rest of the organization to have this one one-hour meeting , which probably should have been handled by two or three people talking for a few minutes .
But instead , there &apos;s a long scheduled meeting , because meetings are scheduled the way software works , which is in increments of 15 minutes , or 30 minutes , or an hour .
You don &apos;t schedule an eight-hour meeting with Outlook .
You can go 15 minutes or 30 minutes or 45 minutes or an hour .
And so we tend to fill these times up when things should really go really quickly .
So meetings and managers are two major problems in businesses today , especially to offices .
These things don &apos;t exist outside of the office .
So I have some suggestions to remedy the situation .
What can managers do -- enlightened managers , hopefully -- what can they do to make the office a better place for people to work , so it &apos;s not the last resort , but it &apos;s the first resort ?
It &apos;s that people start to say , &quot; When I really want to get stuff done , I go to the office . &quot;
Because the offices are well equipped , everything should be there for them to do their work , but they don &apos;t want to go there right now , so how do we change that ?
I have three suggestions I &apos;ll share with you guys .
I have about three minutes , so that &apos;ll fit perfectly .
We &apos;ve all heard of the casual Friday thing .
I don &apos;t know if people still do that .
But how about &quot; no-talk Thursdays ? &quot;
How about -- pick one Thursday once a month and cut that day in half and just say the afternoon -- I &apos;ll make it really easy for you .
So just the afternoon , one Thursday .
The first Thursday of the month -- just the afternoon -- nobody in the office can talk to each other .
Just silence , that &apos;s it .
And what you &apos;ll find is that a tremendous amount of work actually gets done when no one talks to each other .
This is when people actually get stuff done , is when no one &apos;s bothering them , when no one &apos;s interrupting them .
And you can give someone -- giving someone four hours of uninterrupted time is the best gift you can give anybody at work .
It &apos;s better than a computer .
It &apos;s better than a new monitor . It &apos;s better than new software , or whatever people typically use .
Giving them four hours of quiet time at the office is going to be incredibly valuable .
And if you try that , I think you &apos;ll find that you agree .
And maybe , hopefully you can do it more often .
So maybe it &apos;s every other week , or every week , once a week , afternoons no one can talk to each other .
That &apos;s something that you &apos;ll find will really , really work .
Another thing you can try is switching from active communication and collaboration , which is like face-to-face stuff , tapping people on the shoulder , saying hi to them , having meetings , and replace that with more passive models of communication , using things like email and instant messaging , or collaboration products -- things like that .
Now some people might say email is really distracting and I.M. is really distracting , and these other things are really distracting , but they &apos;re distracting at a time of your own choice and your own choosing .
You can quit the email app ; you can &apos;t quit your boss .
You can quit I.M. ; you can &apos;t hide your manager .
You can put these things away , and then you can be interrupted on your own schedule , at your own time , when you &apos;re available , when you &apos;re ready to go again .
Because work , like sleep , happens in phases .
So you &apos;re going to be kind of going up and doing some work , and then you &apos;re going to come down from that work , and then maybe it &apos;s time to check that email , or check that I.M.
And there are very , very few things that are that urgent that need to happen , that need to be answered right this second .
So if you &apos;re a manager , start encouraging people to use more things like I.M. and email and other things that someone else can put away and then get back to you on their own schedule .
And the last suggestion I have is that , if you do have a meeting coming up , if you have the power , just cancel . Just cancel that next meeting .
Today &apos;s Friday -- so Monday , usually people have meetings on Monday .
Just don &apos;t have it .
I don &apos;t mean move it ; I mean just erase it from memory , it &apos;s gone .
And you &apos;ll find out that everything will be just fine .
All these discussions and decisions you thought you had to make at this one time at 9 a.m. on Monday , just forget about them , and things will be just fine .
People have a more open morning , they can actually think , and you &apos;ll find out that maybe all these things you thought you had to do , you don &apos;t actually have to do .
So those are just three quick suggestions I wanted to give you guys to think about this .
And I hope that some of these ideas were at least provocative enough for managers and bosses and business owners and organizers and people who are in charge of other people to think about laying off a little bit and giving people some more time to get some work done .
And I think it &apos;ll all pay off in the end .
So thanks for listening .

&lt; title &gt; Jason Fried : Why work doesn &apos;t happen at work &lt; / title &gt;
&lt; description &gt; Jason Fried has a radical theory of working : that the office isn &apos;t a good place to do it . In his talk , he lays out the main problems and offers three suggestions to make work work . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; &lt; / description &gt;

&lt; url &gt; http : / / www.ted.com / talks / al _ gore _ s _ new _ thinking _ on _ the _ climate _ crisis.html &lt; / url &gt;
I have given the slide show that I gave here two years ago about 2,000 times .
I &apos;m giving a short slide show this morning that I &apos;m giving for the very first time , so -- well it &apos;s -- I don &apos;t want or need to raise the bar , I &apos;m actually trying to lower the bar .
Because I &apos;ve cobbled this together to try to meet the challenge of this session .
And I was reminded by Karen Armstrong &apos;s fantastic presentation that religion really properly understood is not about belief , but about behavior .
Perhaps we should say the same thing about optimism .
How dare we be optimistic ?
Optimism is sometimes characterized as a belief , an intellectual posture .
As Mahatma Gandhi famously said , &quot; You must become the change you wish to see in the world . &quot;
And the outcome about which we wish to be optimistic is not going to be created by the belief alone , except to the extent that the belief brings about new behavior . But the word &quot; behavior &quot; is also , I think , sometimes misunderstood in this context .
I &apos;m a big advocate of changing the lightbulbs and buying hybrids , and Tipper and I put 33 solar panels on our house , and dug the geothermal wells , and did all of that other stuff .
But , as important as it is to change the lightbulbs , it is more important to change the laws .
And when we change our behavior in our daily lives , we sometimes leave out the citizenship part and the democracy part . In order to be optimistic about this , we have to become incredibly active as citizens in our democracy .
In order to solve the climate crisis , we have to solve the democracy crisis .
And we have one .
I have been trying to tell this story for a long time .
I was reminded of that recently , by a woman who walked past the table I was sitting at , just staring at me as she walked past . She was in her 70s , looked like she had a kind face . I thought nothing of it until I saw from the corner of my eye she was walking from the opposite direction , also just staring at me . And so I said , &quot; How do you do ? &quot;
And she said , &quot; You know , if you dyed your hair black , you would look just like Al Gore . &quot;
Many years ago , when I was a young congressman , I spent an awful lot of time dealing with the challenge of nuclear arms control -- the nuclear arms race .
And the military historians taught me , during that quest , that military conflicts are typically put into three categories : local battles , regional or theater wars , and the rare but all-important global , world war -- strategic conflicts .
And each level of conflict requires a different allocation of resources , a different approach , a different organizational model .
Environmental challenges fall into the same three categories , and most of what we think about are local environmental problems : air pollution , water pollution , hazardous waste dumps . But there are also regional environmental problems , like acid rain from the Midwest to the Northeast , and from Western Europe to the Arctic , and from the Midwest out the Mississippi into the dead zone of the Gulf of Mexico .
And there are lots of those . But the climate crisis is the rare but all-important global , or strategic , conflict .
Everything is affected . And we have to organize our response appropriately . We need a worldwide , global mobilization for renewable energy , conservation , efficiency and a global transition to a low-carbon economy .
We have work to do . And we can mobilize resources and political will . But the political will has to be mobilized , in order to mobilize the resources .
Let me show you these slides here .
I thought I would start with the logo . What &apos;s missing here , of course , is the North Polar ice cap .
Greenland remains . Twenty-eight years ago , this is what the polar ice cap -- the North Polar ice cap -- looked like at the end of the summer , at the fall equinox .
This last fall , I went to the Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder , Colorado , and talked to the researchers here in Monterey at the Naval Postgraduate Laboratory .
This is what &apos;s happened in the last 28 years .
To put it in perspective , 2005 was the previous record .
Here &apos;s what happened last fall that has really unnerved the researchers .
The North Polar ice cap is the same size geographically -- doesn &apos;t look quite the same size -- but it is exactly the same size as the United States , minus an area roughly equal to the state of Arizona .
The amount that disappeared in 2005 was equivalent to everything east of the Mississippi .
The extra amount that disappeared last fall was equivalent to this much . It comes back in the winter , but not as permanent ice , as thin ice -- vulnerable . The amount remaining could be completely gone in summer in as little as five years .
That puts a lot of pressure on Greenland .
Already , around the Arctic Circle -- this is a famous village in Alaska . This is a town in Newfoundland . Antarctica . Latest studies from NASA .
The amount of a moderate-to-severe snow melting of an area equivalent to the size of California .
&quot; They were the best of times , they were the worst of times &quot; : the most famous opening sentence in English literature . I want to share briefly a tale of two planets . Earth and Venus are exactly the same size . Earth &apos;s diameter is about 400 kilometers larger , but essentially the same size .
They have exactly the same amount of carbon .
But the difference is , on Earth , most of the carbon has been leeched over time out of the atmosphere , deposited in the ground as coal , oil , natural gas , etc . On Venus , most of it is in the atmosphere . The difference is that our temperature is 59 degrees on average . On Venus , it &apos;s 855 . This is relevant to our current strategy of taking as much carbon out of the ground as quickly as possible , and putting it into the atmosphere .
It &apos;s not because Venus is slightly closer to the Sun .
It &apos;s three times hotter than Mercury , which is right next to the Sun . Now , briefly , here &apos;s an image you &apos;ve seen , as one of the only old images , but I show it because I want to briefly give you CSI : Climate .
The global scientific community says : man-made global warming pollution , put into the atmosphere , thickening this , is trapping more of the outgoing infrared .
You all know that . At the last IPCC summary , the scientists wanted to say , &quot; How certain are you ? &quot; They wanted to answer that &quot; 99 percent . &quot;
The Chinese objected , and so the compromise was &quot; more than 90 percent . &quot;
Now , the skeptics say , &quot; Oh , wait a minute , this could be variations in this energy coming in from the sun . &quot; If that were true , the stratosphere would be heated as well as the lower atmosphere , if it &apos;s more coming in .
If it &apos;s more being trapped on the way out , then you would expect it to be warmer here and cooler here . Here is the lower atmosphere .
Here &apos;s the stratosphere : cooler .
CSI : Climate .
Now , here &apos;s the good news . Sixty-eight percent of Americans now believe that human activity is responsible for global warming . Sixty-nine percent believe that the Earth is heating up in a significant way . There has been progress , but here is the key : when given a list of challenges to confront , global warming is still listed at near the bottom .
What is missing is a sense of urgency .
If you agree with the factual analysis , but you don &apos;t feel the sense of urgency , where does that leave you ?
Well , the Alliance for Climate Protection , which I head in conjunction with Current TV -- who did this pro bono -- did a worldwide contest to do commercials on how to communicate this .
This is the winner .
NBC -- I &apos;ll show all of the networks here -- the top journalists for NBC asked 956 questions in 2007 of the presidential candidates : two of them were about the climate crisis . ABC : 844 questions , two about the climate crisis .
Fox : two . CNN : two . C zero .
From laughs to tears -- this is one of the older tobacco commercials .
So here &apos;s what we &apos;re doing .
This is gasoline consumption in all of these countries . And us .
But it &apos;s not just the developed nations .
The developing countries are now following us and accelerating their pace . And actually , their cumulative emissions this year are the equivalent to where we were in 1965 . And they &apos;re catching up very dramatically . The total concentrations : by 2025 , they will be essentially where we were in 1985 .
If the wealthy countries were completely missing from the picture , we would still have this crisis .
But we have given to the developing countries the technologies and the ways of thinking that are creating the crisis . This is in Bolivia -- over thirty years .
This is peak fishing in a few seconds . The &apos; 60s .
&apos;70s . &apos; 80s . &apos; 90s . We have to stop this . And the good news is that we can .
We have the technologies .
We have to have a unified view of how to go about this : the struggle against poverty in the world and the challenge of cutting wealthy country emissions , all has a single , very simple solution .
People say , &quot; What &apos;s the solution ? &quot; Here it is .
Put a price on carbon . We need a CO2 tax , revenue neutral , to replace taxation on employment , which was invented by Bismarck -- and some things have changed since the 19th century .
In the poor world , we have to integrate the responses to poverty with the solutions to the climate crisis .
Plans to fight poverty in Uganda are mooted , if we do not solve the climate crisis .
But responses can actually make a huge difference in the poor countries . This is a proposal that has been talked about a lot in Europe .
This was from Nature magazine . These are concentrating solar , renewable energy plants , linked in a so-called &quot; supergrid &quot; to supply all of the electrical power to Europe , largely from developing countries -- high-voltage DC currents .
This is not pie in the sky ; this can be done .
We need to do it for our own economy .
The latest figures show that the old model is not working . There are a lot of great investments that you can make . If you are investing in tar sands or shale oil , then you have a portfolio that is crammed with sub-prime carbon assets .
And it is based on an old model .
Junkies find veins in their toes when the ones in their arms and their legs collapse . Developing tar sands and coal shale is the equivalent . Here are just a few of the investments that I personally think make sense .
I have a stake in these , so I &apos;ll have a disclaimer there .
But geothermal , concentrating solar , advanced photovoltaics , efficiency and conservation .
You &apos;ve seen this slide before , but there &apos;s a change .
The only two countries that didn &apos;t ratify -- and now there &apos;s only one . Australia had an election .
And there was a campaign in Australia that involved television and Internet and radio commercials to lift the sense of urgency for the people there .
And we trained 250 people to give the slide show in every town and village and city in Australia .
Lot of other things contributed to it , but the new Prime Minister announced that his very first priority would be to change Australia &apos;s position on Kyoto , and he has . Now , they came to an awareness partly because of the horrible drought that they have had .
This is Lake Lanier . My friend Heidi Cullen said that if we gave droughts names the way we give hurricanes names , we &apos;d call the one in the southeast now Katrina , and we would say it &apos;s headed toward Atlanta .
We can &apos;t wait for the kind of drought Australia had to change our political culture .
Here &apos;s more good news . The cities supporting Kyoto in the U.S.
are up to 780 -- and I thought I saw one go by there , just to localize this -- which is good news .
Now , to close , we heard a couple of days ago about the value of making individual heroism so commonplace that it becomes banal or routine .
What we need is another hero generation . Those of us who are alive in the United States of America today especially , but also the rest of the world , have to somehow understand that history has presented us with a choice -- just as Jill &#91; Bolte &#93; Taylor was figuring out how to save her life while she was distracted by the amazing experience that she was going through .
We now have a culture of distraction .
But we have a planetary emergency .
And we have to find a way to create , in the generation of those alive today , a sense of generational mission .
I wish I could find the words to convey this .
This was another hero generation that brought democracy to the planet .
Another that ended slavery . And that gave women the right to vote .
We can do this . Don &apos;t tell me that we don &apos;t have the capacity to do it .
If we had just one week &apos;s worth of what we spend on the Iraq War , we could be well on the way to solving this challenge .
We have the capacity to do it .
One final point : I &apos;m optimistic , because I believe we have the capacity , at moments of great challenge , to set aside the causes of distraction and rise to the challenge that history is presenting to us .
Sometimes I hear people respond to the disturbing facts of the climate crisis by saying , &quot; Oh , this is so terrible .
What a burden we have . &quot; I would like to ask you to reframe that . How many generations in all of human history have had the opportunity to rise to a challenge that is worthy of our best efforts ?
A challenge that can pull from us more than we knew we could do ? I think we ought to approach this challenge with a sense of profound joy and gratitude that we are the generation about which , a thousand years from now , philharmonic orchestras and poets and singers will celebrate by saying , they were the ones that found it within themselves to solve this crisis and lay the basis for a bright and optimistic human future .
Let &apos;s do that . Thank you very much .
For so many people at TED , there is deep pain that basically a design issue on a voting form -- one bad design issue meant that your voice wasn &apos;t being heard like that in the last eight years in a position where you could make these things come true .
That hurts .
You have no idea .
When you look at what the leading candidates in your own party are doing now -- I mean , there &apos;s -- are you excited by their plans on global warming ?
AG : The answer to the question is hard for me because , on the one hand , I think that we should feel really great about the fact that the Republican nominee -- certain nominee -- John McCain , and both of the finalists for the Democratic nomination -- all three have a very different and forward-leaning position on the climate crisis . All three have offered leadership , and all three are very different from the approach taken by the current administration . And I think that all three have also been responsible in putting forward plans and proposals . But the campaign dialogue that -- as illustrated by the questions -- that was put together by the League of Conservation Voters , by the way , the analysis of all the questions -- and , by the way , the debates have all been sponsored by something that goes by the Orwellian label , &quot; Clean Coal . &quot; Has anybody noticed that ?
Every single debate has been sponsored by &quot; Clean Coal . &quot;
&quot; Now , even lower emissions ! &quot;
The richness and fullness of the dialogue in our democracy has not laid the basis for the kind of bold initiative that is really needed .
So they &apos;re saying the right things and they may -- whichever of them is elected -- may do the right thing , but let me tell you : when I came back from Kyoto in 1997 , with a feeling of great happiness that we &apos;d gotten that breakthrough there , and then confronted the United States Senate , only one out of 100 senators was willing to vote to confirm , to ratify that treaty . Whatever the candidates say has to be laid alongside what the people say .
This challenge is part of the fabric of our whole civilization .
CO2 is the exhaling breath of our civilization , literally .
And now we mechanized that process . Changing that pattern requires a scope , a scale , a speed of change that is beyond what we have done in the past .
So that &apos;s why I began by saying , be optimistic in what you do , but be an active citizen .
Demand -- change the light bulbs , but change the laws . Change the global treaties .
We have to speak up . We have to solve this democracy -- this -- We have sclerosis in our democracy . And we have to change that .
Use the Internet . Go on the Internet .
Connect with people . Become very active as citizens .
Have a moratorium -- we shouldn &apos;t have any new coal-fired generating plants that aren &apos;t able to capture and store CO2 , which means we have to quickly build these renewable sources .
Now , nobody is talking on that scale . But I do believe that between now and November , it is possible .
This Alliance for Climate Protection is going to launch a nationwide campaign -- grassroots mobilization , television ads , Internet ads , radio , newspaper -- with partnerships with everybody from the Girl Scouts to the hunters and fishermen .
We need help . We need help .
In terms of your own personal role going forward , Al , is there something more than that you would like to be doing ?
AG : I have prayed that I would be able to find the answer to that question . What can I do ?
Buckminster Fuller once wrote , &quot; If the future of all human civilization depended on me , what would I do ?
How would I be ? &quot; It does depend on all of us , but again , not just with the light bulbs .
We , most of us here , are Americans . We have a democracy .
We can change things , but we have to actively change .
What &apos;s needed really is a higher level of consciousness .
And that &apos;s hard to -- that &apos;s hard to create -- but it is coming .
There &apos;s an old African proverb that some of you know that says , &quot; If you want to go quickly , go alone ; if you want to go far , go together . &quot; We have to go far , quickly .
So we have to have a change in consciousness .
A change in commitment . A new sense of urgency .
A new appreciation for the privilege that we have of undertaking this challenge .
Al Gore , thank you so much for coming to TED .
AG : Thank you . Thank you very much .

&lt; url &gt; http : / / www.ted.com / talks / michael _ pritchard _ invents _ a _ water _ filter.html &lt; / url &gt;
Good morning everybody .
I &apos;d like to talk about a couple of things today .
The first thing is water .
Now I see you &apos;ve all been enjoying the water that &apos;s been provided for you here at the conference , over the past couple of days .
And I &apos;m sure you &apos;ll feel that it &apos;s from a safe source .
But what if it wasn &apos;t ?
What if it was from a source like this ?
Then statistics would actually say that half of you would now be suffering with diarrhea .
I talked a lot in the past about statistics , and the provision of safe drinking water for all .
But they just don &apos;t seem to get through .
And I think I &apos;ve worked out why .
It &apos;s because , using current thinking , the scale of the problem just seems too huge to contemplate solving .
So we just switch off : us , governments and aid agencies .
Well , today , I &apos;d like to show you that through thinking differently , the problem has been solved .
By the way , since I &apos;ve been speaking , another 13,000 people around the world are suffering now with diarrhea .
And four children have just died .
I invented Lifesaver bottle because I got angry .
I , like most of you , was sitting down , the day after Christmas in 2004 , when I was watching the devastating news of the Asian tsunami as it rolled in , playing out on TV .
The days and weeks that followed , people fleeing to the hills , being forced to drink contaminated water or face death .
That really stuck with me .
Then , a few months later , Hurricane Katrina slammed into the side of America .
&quot; Okay , &quot; I thought , &quot; here &apos;s a First World country , let &apos;s see what they can do . &quot;
Day one : nothing .
Day two : nothing .
Do you know it took five days to get water to the Superdome ?
People were shooting each other on the streets for TV sets and water .
That &apos;s when I decided I had to do something .
Now I spent a lot of time in my garage , over the next weeks and months , and also in my kitchen -- much to the dismay of my wife .
However , after a few failed prototypes , I finally came up with this , the Lifesaver bottle .
Okay , now for the science bit .
Before Lifesaver , the best hand filters were only capable of filtering down to about 200 nanometers .
The smallest bacteria is about 200 nanometers .
So a 200-nanometer bacteria is going to get through a 200-nanometer hole .
The smallest virus , on the other hand , is about 25 nanometers .
So that &apos;s definitely going to get through those 200 nanometer holes .
Lifesaver pores are 15 nanometers .
So nothing is getting through .
Okay , I &apos;m going to give you a bit of a demonstration .
Would you like to see that ?
I spent all the time setting this up , so I guess I should .
We &apos;re in the fine city of Oxford .
So -- someone &apos;s done that up .
Fine city of Oxford , so what I &apos;ve done is I &apos;ve gone and got some water from the River Cherwell , and the River Thames , that flow through here . And this is the water .
But I got to thinking , you know , if we were in the middle of a flood zone in Bangladesh , the water wouldn &apos;t look like this .
So I &apos;ve gone and got some stuff to add into it .
And this is from my pond .
Have a smell of that , mister cameraman .
Okay . Right .
We &apos;re just going to pour that in there .
Audience : Ugh !
Michael Pritchard : Okay . We &apos;ve got some runoff from a sewage plant farm .
So I &apos;m just going to put that in there .
Put that in there . There we go .
And some other bits and pieces , chuck that in there .
And I &apos;ve got a gift here from a friend of mine &apos;s rabbit .
So we &apos;re just going to put that in there as well .
Okay . Now .
The Lifesaver bottle works really simply .
You just scoop the water up .
Today I &apos;m going to use a jug just to show you all . Let &apos;s get a bit of that poo in there .
That &apos;s not dirty enough . Let &apos;s just stir that up a little bit .
Okay , so I &apos;m going to take this really filthy water , and put it in here . Do you want a drink yet ?
Okay . There we go .
Replace the top .
Give it a few pumps . Okay ?
That &apos;s all that &apos;s necessary .
Now as soon as I pop the teat , sterile drinking water is going to come out .
I &apos;ve got to be quick . Okay , ready ?
There we go . Mind the electrics .
That is safe , sterile drinking water .
Cheers .
There you go Chris .
What &apos;s it taste of ?
Delicious .
Michael Pritchard : Okay .
Let &apos;s see Chris &apos;s program throughout the rest of the show . Okay ?
Okay . Lifesaver bottle is used by thousands of people around the world .
It &apos;ll last for 6,000 liters .
And when it &apos;s expired , using failsafe technology , the system will shut off , protecting the user .
Pop the cartridge out . Pop a new one in .
It &apos;s good for another 6,000 liters .
So let &apos;s look at the applications .
Traditionally , in a crisis , what do we do ?
We ship water .
Then , after a few weeks , we set up camps .
And people are forced to come into the camps to get their safe drinking water .
What happens when 20,000 people congregate in a camp ?
Diseases spread . More resources are required .
The problem just becomes self-perpetuating .
But by thinking differently , and shipping these , people can stay put .
They can make their own sterile drinking water , and start to get on with rebuilding their homes and their lives .
Now , it doesn &apos;t require a natural disaster for this to work .
Using the old thinking , of national infrastructure and pipe work , is too expensive .
When you run the numbers on a calculator , you run out of noughts .
So here is the &quot; thinking different &quot; bit .
Instead of shipping water , and using man-made processes to do it , let &apos;s use Mother Nature . She &apos;s got a fantastic system .
She picks the water up from there , desalinates it , for free , transports it over there , and dumps it onto the mountains , rivers , and streams .
And where do people live ? Near water .
All we &apos;ve go to do is make it sterile . How do we do that ?
Well , we could use the Lifesaver bottle .
Or we could use one of these .
The same technology , in a jerry can .
This will process 25,000 liters of water ; that &apos;s good enough for a family of four , for three years .
And how much does it cost ?
About half a cent a day to run .
Thank you .
So , by thinking differently , and processing water at the point of use , mothers and children no longer have to walk four hours a day to collect their water .
They can get it from a source nearby .
So with just eight billion dollars , we can hit the millennium goal &apos;s target of halving the number of people without access to safe drinking water .
To put that into context , The U.K. government spends about 12 billion pounds a year on foreign aid .
But why stop there ?
With 20 billion dollars , everyone can have access to safe drinking water .
So the three-and-a-half billion people that suffer every year as a result , and the two million kids that die every year , will live .
Thank you .

&lt; url &gt; http : / / www.ted.com / talks / david _ bismark _ e _ voting _ without _ fraud.html &lt; / url &gt;
So there are a few things that bring us humans together in the way that an election does .
We stand in elections ; we vote in elections ; we observe elections .
Our democracies rely on elections .
We all understand why we have elections , and we all leave the house on the same day to go and vote .
We cherish the opportunity to have our say , to help decide the future of the country .
The fundamental idea is that politicians are given mandate to speak for us , to make decisions on our behalf that affect us all .
Without that mandate , they would be corrupt .
Well unfortunately , power corrupts , and so people will do lots of things to get power and to stay in power , including doing bad things to elections .
You see , even if the idea of the election is perfect , running a countrywide election is a big project , and big projects are messy .
Whenever there is an election , it seems like something always goes wrong , someone tries to cheat , or something goes accidentally awry -- a ballot box goes missing here , chads are left hanging over here .
To make sure as few things as possible go wrong , we have all these procedures around the election .
So for example , you come to the polling station , and a poll station worker asks for your ID before giving you a ballot form and asking you to go into a voting booth to fill out your vote .
When you come back out , you get to drop your vote into the ballot box where it mixes with all the other votes , so that no one knows how you voted .
Well , what I want us to think about for a moment is what happens after that , after you drop your vote into the ballot box .
And most people would go home and feel sure that their vote has been counted , because they trust that the election system works .
They trust that election workers and election observers do their jobs and do their jobs correctly .
The ballot boxes go to counting places .
They &apos;re unsealed and the votes are poured out and laboriously counted .
Most of us have to trust that that happens correctly for our own vote , and we all have to trust that that happens correctly for all the votes in the election .
So we have to trust a lot of people .
We have to trust a lot of procedures .
And sometimes we even have to trust computers .
So imagine hundreds of millions of voters casting hundreds of millions of votes , all to be counted correctly and all the things that can possibly go wrong causing all these bad headlines , and you cannot help but feel exhausted at the idea of trying to make elections better .
Well in the face of all these bad headlines , researchers have taken a step back and thought about how we can do elections differently .
They &apos;ve zoomed out and looked at the big picture .
And the big picture is this : elections should be verifiable .
Voters should be able to check that their votes are counted correctly , without breaking election secrecy , which is so very important .
And that &apos;s the tough part .
How do we make an election system completely verifiable while keeping the votes absolutely secret ?
Well , the way we &apos;ve come up with uses computers but doesn &apos;t depend on them .
And the secret is the ballot form .
And if you look closely at these ballot forms , you &apos;ll notice that the candidate list is in a different order on each one .
And that means , if you mark your choices on one of them and then remove the candidate list , I won &apos;t be able to tell from the bit remaining what your vote is for .
And on each ballot form there is this encrypted value in the form of this 2D barcode on the right .
And there &apos;s some complicated cryptography going on in there , but what &apos;s not complicated is voting with one of these forms .
So we can let computers do all the complicated cryptography for us , and then we &apos;ll use the paper for verification .
So this is how you vote .
You get one of these ballot forms at random , and then you go into the voting booth , and you mark your choices , and you tear along a perforation .
And you shred the candidate list .
And the bit that remains , the one with your marks -- this is your encrypted vote .
So you let a poll station worker scan your encrypted vote .
And because it &apos;s encrypted , it can be submitted , stored and counted centrally and displayed on a website for anyone to see , including you .
So you take this encrypted vote home as your receipt .
And after the close of the election , you can check that your vote was counted by comparing your receipt to the vote on the website .
And remember , the vote is encrypted from the moment you leave the voting booth , so if an election official wants to find out how you voted , they will not be able to .
If the government wants to find out how you voted , they won &apos;t be able to .
No hacker can break in and find out how you voted .
No hacker can break in and change your vote , because then it won &apos;t match your receipt .
Votes can &apos;t go missing because then you won &apos;t find yours when you look for it .
But the election magic doesn &apos;t stop there .
Instead , we want to make the whole process so transparent that news media and international observers and anyone who wants to can download all the election data and do the count themselves .
They can check that all the votes were counted correctly .
They can check that the announced result of the election is the correct one .
And these are elections by the people , for the people .
So the next step for our democracies are transparent and verifiable elections .
Thank you .

&lt; url &gt; http : / / www.ted.com / talks / joe _ sabia _ the _ technology _ of _ storytelling.html &lt; / url &gt;
Ladies and gentlemen , gather around .
I would love to share with you a story .
Once upon a time in 19th century Germany , there was the book .
Now during this time , the book was the king of storytelling .
It was venerable .
It was ubiquitous .
But it was a little bit boring .
Because in its 400 years of existence , storytellers never evolved the book as a storytelling device .
But then one author arrived , and he changed the game forever .
His name was Lothar , Lothar Meggendorfer .
Lothar Meggendorfer put his foot down , and he said , &quot; Genug ist genug ! &quot;
He grabbed his pen , he snatched his scissors .
This man refused to fold to the conventions of normalcy and just decided to fold .
History would know Lothar Meggendorfer as -- who else ? -- the world &apos;s first true inventor of the children &apos;s pop-up book .
For this delight and for this wonder , people rejoiced .
They were happy because the story survived , and that the world would keep on spinning .
Lothar Meggendorfer wasn &apos;t the first to evolve the way a story was told , and he certainly wasn &apos;t the last .
Whether storytellers realized it or not , they were channeling Meggendorfer &apos;s spirit when they moved opera to vaudville , radio news to radio theater , film to film in motion to film in sound , color , 3D , on VHS and on DVD .
There seemed to be no cure for this Meggendorferitis .
And things got a lot more fun when the Internet came around .
Because , not only could people broadcast their stories throughout the world , but they could do so using what seemed to be an infinite amount of devices .
For example , one company would tell a story of love through its very own search engine .
One Taiwanese production studio would interpret American politics in 3D .
And one man would tell the stories of his father by using a platform called Twitter to communicate the excrement his father would gesticulate .
And after all this , everyone paused ; they took a step back .
They realized that , in 6,000 years of storytelling , they &apos;ve gone from depicting hunting on cave walls to depicting Shakespeare on Facebook walls .
And this was a cause for celebration .
The art of storytelling has remained unchanged .
And for the most part , the stories are recycled .
But the way that humans tell the stories has always evolved with pure , consistent novelty .
And they remembered a man , one amazing German , every time a new storytelling device popped up next .
And for that , the audience -- the lovely , beautiful audience -- would live happily ever after .

&lt; url &gt; http : / / www.ted.com / talks / dean _ ornish _ says _ your _ genes _ are _ not _ your _ fate.html &lt; / url &gt;
One way to change our genes is to make new ones , as Craig Venter has so elegantly shown .
Another is to change our lifestyles .
And what we &apos;re learning is how powerful and dynamic these changes can be , that you don &apos;t have to wait very long to see the benefits .
When you eat healthier , manage stress , exercise and love more , your brain actually gets more blood flow and more oxygen .
But more than that , your brain gets measurably bigger .
Things that were thought impossible just a few years ago can actually be measured now .
This was figured out by Robin Williams a few years before the rest of us .
Now , there &apos;s some things that you can do to make your brain grow new brain cells .
Some of my favorite things , like chocolate and tea , blueberries , alcohol in moderation , stress management and cannabinoids found in marijuana .
I &apos;m just the messenger .
What were we just talking about ?
And other things that can make it worse , that can cause you to lose brain cells .
The usual suspects , like saturated fat and sugar , nicotine , opiates , cocaine , too much alcohol and chronic stress .
Your skin gets more blood flow when you change your lifestyle , so you age less quickly . Your skin doesn &apos;t wrinkle as much .
Your heart gets more blood flow .
We &apos;ve shown that you can actually reverse heart disease .
That these clogged arteries that you see on the upper left , after only a year become measurably less clogged .
And the cardiac PET scan shown on the lower left , the blue means no blood flow .
A year later -- orange and white is maximum blood flow .
We &apos;ve shown you may be able to stop and reverse the progression of early prostate cancer and , by extension , breast cancer , simply by making these changes .
We &apos;ve found that tumor growth in vitro was inhibited 70 percent in the group that made these changes , whereas only nine percent in the comparison group .
These differences were highly significant .
Even your sexual organs get more blood flow , so you increase sexual potency .
One of the most effective anti-smoking ads was done by the Department of Health Services , showing that nicotine , which constricts your arteries , can cause a heart attack or a stroke , but it also causes impotence .
Half of guys who smoke are impotent .
How sexy is that ?
Now we &apos;re also about to publish a study -- the first study showing you can change gene expression in men with prostate cancer .
This is what &apos;s called a heat map -- and the different colors -- and along the side , on the right , are different genes .
And we found that over 500 genes were favorably changed -- in effect , turning on the good genes , the disease-preventing genes , turning off the disease-promoting genes .
And so these findings I think are really very powerful , giving many people new hope and new choices .
And companies like Navigenics and DNA Direct and 23andMe , that are giving you your genetic profiles , are giving some people a sense of , &quot; Gosh , well , what can I do about it ? &quot;
Well , our genes are not our fate , and if we make these changes -- they &apos;re a predisposition -- but if we make bigger changes than we might have made otherwise , we can actually change how our genes are expressed .
Thank you .

&lt; url &gt; http : / / www.ted.com / talks / jennifer _ healey _ if _ cars _ could _ talk _ accidents _ might _ be _ avoidable.html &lt; / url &gt;
Let &apos;s face it : Driving is dangerous .
It &apos;s one of the things that we don &apos;t like to think about , but the fact that religious icons and good luck charms show up on dashboards around the world betrays the fact that we know this to be true .
Car accidents are the leading cause of death in people ages 16 to 19 in the United States -- leading cause of death -- and 75 percent of these accidents have nothing to do with drugs or alcohol .
So what happens ?
No one can say for sure , but I remember my first accident .
I was a young driver out on the highway , and the car in front of me , I saw the brake lights go on .
I &apos;m like , &quot; Okay , all right , this guy is slowing down , I &apos;ll slow down too . &quot;
I step on the brake .
But no , this guy isn &apos;t slowing down .
This guy is stopping , dead stop , dead stop on the highway .
It was just going 65 -- to zero ?
I slammed on the brakes .
I felt the ABS kick in , and the car is still going , and it &apos;s not going to stop , and I know it &apos;s not going to stop , and the air bag deploys , the car is totaled , and fortunately , no one was hurt .
But I had no idea that car was stopping , and I think we can do a lot better than that .
I think we can transform the driving experience by letting our cars talk to each other .
I just want you to think a little bit about what the experience of driving is like now .
Get into your car . Close the door . You &apos;re in a glass bubble .
You can &apos;t really directly sense the world around you .
You &apos;re in this extended body .
You &apos;re tasked with navigating it down partially-seen roadways , in and amongst other metal giants , at super-human speeds .
Okay ? And all you have to guide you are your two eyes .
Okay , so that &apos;s all you have , eyes that weren &apos;t really designed for this task , but then people ask you to do things like , you want to make a lane change , what &apos;s the first thing they ask you do ?
Take your eyes off the road . That &apos;s right .
Stop looking where you &apos;re going , turn , check your blind spot , and drive down the road without looking where you &apos;re going .
You and everyone else . This is the safe way to drive .
Why do we do this ? Because we have to , we have to make a choice , do I look here or do I look here ?
What &apos;s more important ?
And usually we do a fantastic job picking and choosing what we attend to on the road .
But occasionally we miss something .
Occasionally we sense something wrong or too late .
In countless accidents , the driver says , &quot; I didn &apos;t see it coming . &quot;
And I believe that . I believe that .
We can only watch so much .
But the technology exists now that can help us improve that .
In the future , with cars exchanging data with each other , we will be able to see not just three cars ahead and three cars behind , to the right and left , all at the same time , bird &apos;s eye view , we will actually be able to see into those cars .
We will be able to see the velocity of the car in front of us , to see how fast that guy &apos;s going or stopping .
If that guy &apos;s going down to zero , I &apos;ll know .
And with computation and algorithms and predictive models , we will be able to see the future .
You may think that &apos;s impossible .
How can you predict the future ? That &apos;s really hard .
Actually , no . With cars , it &apos;s not impossible .
Cars are three-dimensional objects that have a fixed position and velocity .
They travel down roads .
Often they travel on pre-published routes .
It &apos;s really not that hard to make reasonable predictions about where a car &apos;s going to be in the near future .
Even if , when you &apos;re in your car and some motorcyclist comes -- bshoom ! -- 85 miles an hour down , lane-splitting -- I know you &apos;ve had this experience -- that guy didn &apos;t &quot; just come out of nowhere . &quot;
That guy &apos;s been on the road probably for the last half hour .
Right ? I mean , somebody &apos;s seen him .
Ten , 20 , 30 miles back , someone &apos;s seen that guy , and as soon as one car sees that guy and puts him on the map , he &apos;s on the map -- position , velocity , good estimate he &apos;ll continue going 85 miles an hour .
You &apos;ll know , because your car will know , because that other car will have whispered something in his ear , like , &quot; By the way , five minutes , motorcyclist , watch out . &quot;
You can make reasonable predictions about how cars behave .
I mean , they &apos;re Newtonian objects .
That &apos;s very nice about them .
So how do we get there ?
We can start with something as simple as sharing our position data between cars , just sharing GPS .
If I have a GPS and a camera in my car , I have a pretty precise idea of where I am and how fast I &apos;m going .
With computer vision , I can estimate where the cars around me are , sort of , and where they &apos;re going .
And same with the other cars .
They can have a precise idea of where they are , and sort of a vague idea of where the other cars are .
What happens if two cars share that data , if they talk to each other ?
I can tell you exactly what happens .
Both models improve .
Everybody wins .
Professor Bob Wang and his team have done computer simulations of what happens when fuzzy estimates combine , even in light traffic , when cars just share GPS data , and we &apos;ve moved this research out of the computer simulation and into robot test beds that have the actual sensors that are in cars now on these robots : stereo cameras , GPS , and the two-dimensional laser range finders that are common in backup systems .
We also attach a discrete short-range communication radio , and the robots talk to each other .
When these robots come at each other , they track each other &apos;s position precisely , and they can avoid each other .
We &apos;re now adding more and more robots into the mix , and we encountered some problems .
One of the problems , when you get too much chatter , it &apos;s hard to process all the packets , so you have to prioritize , and that &apos;s where the predictive model helps you .
If your robot cars are all tracking the predicted trajectories , you don &apos;t pay as much attention to those packets .
You prioritize the one guy who seems to be going a little off course .
That guy could be a problem .
And you can predict the new trajectory .
So you don &apos;t only know that he &apos;s going off course , you know how .
And you know which drivers you need to alert to get out of the way .
And we wanted to do -- how can we best alert everyone ?
How can these cars whisper , &quot; You need to get out of the way ? &quot;
Well , it depends on two things : one , the ability of the car , and second the ability of the driver .
If one guy has a really great car , but they &apos;re on their phone or , you know , doing something , they &apos;re not probably in the best position to react in an emergency .
So we started a separate line of research doing driver state modeling .
And now , using a series of three cameras , we can detect if a driver is looking forward , looking away , looking down , on the phone , or having a cup of coffee .
We can predict the accident and we can predict who , which cars , are in the best position to move out of the way to calculate the safest route for everyone .
Fundamentally , these technologies exist today .
I think the biggest problem that we face is our own willingness to share our data .
I think it &apos;s a very disconcerting notion , this idea that our cars will be watching us , talking about us to other cars , that we &apos;ll be going down the road in a sea of gossip .
But I believe it can be done in a way that protects our privacy , just like right now , when I look at your car from the outside , I don &apos;t really know about you .
If I look at your license plate number , I don &apos;t really know who you are .
I believe our cars can talk about us behind our backs .
And I think it &apos;s going to be a great thing .
I want you to consider for a moment if you really don &apos;t want the distracted teenager behind you to know that you &apos;re braking , that you &apos;re coming to a dead stop .
By sharing our data willingly , we can do what &apos;s best for everyone .
So let your car gossip about you .

&lt; description &gt; When we drive , we get into a glass bubble , lock the doors and press the accelerator , relying on our eyes to guide us -- even though we can only see the few cars ahead of and behind us . But what if cars could share data with each other about their position and velocity , and use predictive models to calculate the safest routes for everyone on the road ?

&lt; url &gt; http : / / www.ted.com / talks / becky _ blanton _ the _ year _ i _ was _ homeless.html &lt; / url &gt;
I &apos;m a writer and a journalist , and I &apos;m also an insanely curious person , so in 22 years as a journalist , I &apos;ve learned how to do a lot of new things .
And three years ago , one of the things I learned how to do was to become invisible .
I became one of the working homeless .
I quit my job as a newspaper editor after my father died in February of that same year , and decided to travel .
His death hit me pretty hard .
And there were a lot of things that I wanted to feel and deal with while I was doing that .
I &apos;ve camped my whole life . And I decided that living in a van for a year to do this would be like one long camping trip .
So I packed my cat , my Rottweiler and my camping gear into a 1975 Chevy van , and drove off into the sunset , having fully failed to realize three critical things .
One : that society equates living in a permanent structure , even a shack , with having value as a person .
Two : I failed to realize how quickly the negative perceptions of other people can impact our reality , if we let it .
Three : I failed to realize that homelessness is an attitude , not a lifestyle .
At first , living in the van was great .
I showered in campgrounds . I ate out regularly .
And I had time to relax and to grieve .
But then the anger and the depression about my father &apos;s death set in .
My freelance job ended . And I had to get a full-time job to pay the bills .
What had been a really mild spring turned into a miserably hot summer .
And it became impossible to park anywhere -- -- without being very obvious that I had a cat and a dog with me , and it was really hot .
The cat came and went through an open window in the van .
The doggy went into doggy day care .
And I sweated .
Whenever I could , I used employee showers in office buildings and truck stops .
Or I washed up in public rest rooms .
Nighttime temperatures in the van rarely dropped below 80 degrees Fahrenheit , making it difficult or impossible to sleep .
Food rotted in the heat .
Ice in my ice chest melted within hours , and it was pretty miserable .
I couldn &apos;t afford to find an apartment , or couldn &apos;t afford an apartment that would allow me to have the Rottweiler and the cat .
And I refused to give them up , so I stayed in the van .
And when the heat made me too sick to walk the 50 feet to the public restroom outside my van at night , I used a bucket and a trash bag as a toilet .
When winter weather set in , the temperatures dropped below freezing . And they stayed there .
And I faced a whole new set of challenges .
I parked a different place every night so I would avoid being noticed and hassled by the police .
I didn &apos;t always succeed .
But I felt out of control of my life .
And I don &apos;t know when or how it happened , but the speed at which I went from being a talented writer and journalist to being a homeless woman , living in a van , took my breath away .
I hadn &apos;t changed . My I.Q. hadn &apos;t dropped .
My talent , my integrity , my values , everything about me remained the same .
But I had changed somehow .
I spiraled deeper and deeper into a depression .
And eventually someone referred me to a homeless health clinic .
And I went . I hadn &apos;t bathed in three days .
I was as smelly and as depressed as anyone in line .
I just wasn &apos;t drunk or high .
And when several of the homeless men realized that , including a former university professor , they said , &quot; You aren &apos;t homeless . Why are you really here ? &quot;
Other homeless people didn &apos;t see me as homeless , but I did .
Then the professor listened to my story and he said , &quot; You have a job . You have hope .
The real homeless don &apos;t have hope . &quot;
A reaction to the medication the clinic gave me for my depression left me suicidal . And I remember thinking , &quot; If I killed myself , no one would notice . &quot;
A friend told me , shortly after that , that she had heard that Tim Russert , a nationally renowned journalist , had been talking about me on national T.V.
An essay I &apos;d written about my father , the year before he died , was in Tim &apos;s new book .
And he was doing the talk show circuit . And he was talking about my writing .
And when I realized that Tim Russert , former moderator of &quot; Meet the Press , &quot; was talking about my writing , while I was living in a van in a Wal-Mart parking lot , I started laughing .
You should too .
I started laughing because it got to the point where , was I a writer , or was I a homeless woman ?
So I went in the bookstore . And I found Tim &apos;s book .
And I stood there . And I reread my essay .
And I cried .
Because I was a writer .
I was a writer .
Shortly after that I moved back to Tennessee .
I alternated between living in a van and couch surfing with friends .
And I started writing again .
By the summer of the following year I was a working journalist .
I was winning awards . I was living in my own apartment .
I was no longer homeless .
And I was no longer invisible .
Thousands of people work full and part-time jobs , and live in their cars .
But society continues to stigmatize and criminalize living in your vehicle or on the streets .
So the homeless , the working homeless , primarily remain invisible .
But if you ever meet one , engage them , encourage them , and offer them hope .
The human spirit can overcome anything if it has hope .
And I &apos;m not here to be the poster girl for the homeless .
I &apos;m not here to encourage you to give money to the next panhandler you meet .
But I am here to tell you that , based on my experience , people are not where they live , where they sleep , or what their life situation is at any given time .
Three years ago I was living in a van in a Wal-Mart parking lot , and today I &apos;m speaking at TED .
Hope always , always finds a way . Thank you .

&lt; url &gt; http : / / www.ted.com / talks / derek _ sivers _ how _ to _ start _ a _ movement.html &lt; / url &gt;
So , ladies and gentlemen , at TED we talk a lot about leadership and how to make a movement .
So let &apos;s watch a movement happen , start to finish , in under three minutes and dissect some lessons from it .
First , of course you know , a leader needs the guts to stand out and be ridiculed .
But what he &apos;s doing is so easy to follow .
So here &apos;s his first follower with a crucial role ; he &apos;s going to show everyone else how to follow .
Now , notice that the leader embraces him as an equal .
So , now it &apos;s not about the leader anymore ; it &apos;s about them , plural .
Now , there he is calling to his friends .
Now , if you notice that the first follower is actually an underestimated form of leadership in itself .
It takes guts to stand out like that .
The first follower is what transforms a lone nut into a leader .
And here comes a second follower .
Now it &apos;s not a lone nut , it &apos;s not two nuts -- three is a crowd , and a crowd is news .
So a movement must be public .
It &apos;s important to show not just to show the leader , but the followers , because you find that new followers emulate the followers , not the leader .
Now , here come two more people , and immediately after , three more people .
Now we &apos;ve got momentum . This is the tipping point .
Now we &apos;ve got a movement .
So , notice that , as more people join in , it &apos;s less risky .
So those that were sitting on the fence before , now have no reason not to .
They won &apos;t stand out , they won &apos;t be ridiculed , but they will be part of the in-crowd if they hurry .
So , over the next minute , you &apos;ll see all of those that prefer to stick with the crowd because eventually they would be ridiculed for not joining in .
And that &apos;s how you make a movement .
But let &apos;s recap some lessons from this .
So first , if you are the type , like the shirtless dancing guy that is standing alone , remember the importance of nurturing your first few followers as equals so it &apos;s clearly about the movement , not you .
Okay , but we might have missed the real lesson here .
The biggest lesson , if you noticed -- did you catch it ? -- is that leadership is over-glorified .
That , yes , it was the shirtless guy who was first , and he &apos;ll get all the credit , but it was really the first follower that transformed the lone nut into a leader .
So , as we &apos;re told that we should all be leaders , that would be really ineffective .
If you really care about starting a movement , have the courage to follow and show others how to follow .
And when you find a lone nut doing something great , have the guts to be the first one to stand up and join in .
And what a perfect place to do that , at TED .
Thanks .

How many of you have seen the Alfred Hitchcock film &quot; The Birds &quot; ?
Any of you get really freaked out by that ?
You might want to leave now .
So , this is a vending machine for crows .
And over the past few days , many of you have been asking me , &quot; How did you come to this ? How did you get started doing this ? &quot;
And it started , as with many great ideas , or many ideas you can &apos;t get rid of anyway , at a cocktail party .
About 10 years ago , I was at a cocktail party with a friend of mine , and we &apos;re sitting there , and he was complaining about the crows that he had seen that were all over his yard and making a big mess .
And he was telling me that really , we ought to try and eradicate these things .
We gotta kill them because they &apos;re making a mess .
I said that was stupid , you know , maybe we should just train them to do something useful .
And he said that was impossible .
And I &apos;m sure I &apos;m in good company in finding that tremendously annoying -- when someone tells you it &apos;s impossible .
So , I spent the next 10 years reading about crows in my spare time .
And after 10 years of this , my wife eventually said , &quot; Look , you know , you gotta do this thing you &apos;ve been talking about , and build the vending machine . &quot;
So I did .
But part of the reason that I found this interesting is that I started noticing that we are very aware of all the species that are going extinct on the planet as a result of human habitation expansion , and no one seems to be paying attention to all the species that are actually living -- that are surviving .
And I &apos;m talking specifically about synanthropic species , which are species that have adapted specifically for human ecologies , species like rats and cockroaches and crows .
And as I started looking at them , I was finding that they had hyper-adapted .
They &apos;d become extremely adept at living with us .
And in return , we just tried to kill them all the time .
And in doing so , we were breeding them for parasitism .
We were giving them all sorts of reasons to adapt new ways .
So , for example , rats are incredibly responsive breeders .
And cockroaches , as anyone who &apos;s tried to get rid of them knows , have become really immune to the poisons that we &apos;re using .
So , I thought , let &apos;s build something that &apos;s mutually beneficial .
Well , then let &apos;s build something that we can both benefit from , and find some way to make a new relationship with these species .
And so I built the vending machine .
But the story of the vending machine is a little more interesting if you know more about crows .
It turns out that crows aren &apos;t just surviving with human beings -- they &apos;re actually really thriving .
They &apos;re found everywhere on the planet except for the Arctic and the southern tip of South America .
And in all that area , they &apos;re only rarely found breeding more than five kilometers away from human beings .
So we may not think about them , but they &apos;re always around .
And not surprisingly , given the human population growth , more than half of the human population is living in cities now .
And out of those , nine-tenths of the human growth population is occurring in cities .
We &apos;re seeing a population boom with crows .
So bird counts are indicating that we might be seeing up to exponential growth in their numbers .
So that &apos;s no great surprise .
But what was really interesting to me was to find out that the birds were adapting in a pretty unusual way .
And I &apos;ll give you an example of that .
So this is Betty . She &apos;s a New Caledonian crow .
And these crows use sticks in the wild to get insects and whatnot out of pieces of wood .
Here , she &apos;s trying to get a piece of meat out of a tube .
But the researchers had a problem .
They messed up and left just a stick of wire in there .
And she hadn &apos;t had the opportunity to do this before .
You see , it wasn &apos;t working very well .
So she adapted .
Now this is completely unprompted . She had never seen this done before .
No one taught her to bend this into a hook , had shown her how it could happen .
But she did it all on her own .
So keep in mind that she &apos;s never seen this done .
Right .
Yeah . All right .
That &apos;s the part where the researchers freak out .
So , it turns out we &apos;ve been finding more and more that crows are really , really intelligent .
Their brains are proportionate , in the same proportion as chimpanzee brains are .
There are all kinds of anecdotes for different kinds of intelligence they have .
For example , in Sweden , crows will wait for fishermen to drop lines through holes in the ice .
And when the fishermen move off , the crows fly down , reel up the lines , and eat the fish or the bait .
It &apos;s pretty annoying for the fishermen .
On an entirely different tack , at University of Washington , they , a few years ago , were doing an experiment where they captured some crows on campus .
Some students went out and netted some crows , brought them in , and were -- weighed them , and measured them and whatnot , and then let them back out again .
And were entertained to discover that for the rest of the week , these crows , whenever these particular students walked around campus , these crows would caw at them , and run around and make their life kind of miserable .
They were significantly less entertained when this went on for the next week .
And the next month . And after summer break .
Until they finally graduated and left campus , and -- glad to get away , I &apos;m sure -- came back sometime later , and found the crows still remembered them .
So -- the moral being , don &apos;t piss off crows .
So now , students at the University of Washington that are studying these crows do so with a giant wig and a big mask .
It &apos;s fairly interesting .
So we know that these crows are really smart , but the more I dug into this , the more I found that they actually have an even more significant adaptation .
Crows have become highly skilled at making a living in these new urban environments .
In this Japanese city , they have devised a way of eating a food that normally they can &apos;t manage : drop it among the traffic .
The problem now is collecting the bits , without getting run over .
Wait for the light to stop the traffic .
Then , collect your cracked nut in safety .
Joshua Klein : Yeah , yeah . Pretty interesting .
So what &apos;s significant about this isn &apos;t that crows are using cars to crack nuts .
In fact , that &apos;s old hat for crows .
This happened about 10 years ago in a place called Sendai City , at a driving school in the suburbs of Tokyo .
And since that time , all of the crows in the neighborhood are picking up this behavior .
And now , every crow within five kilometers is standing by a sidewalk , waiting to collect its lunch .
So , they &apos;re learning from each other . And research bears this out .
Parents seem to be teaching their young .
They &apos;ve learned from their peers . They &apos;ve learned from their enemies .
If I have a little extra time , I &apos;ll tell you about a case of crow infidelity that illustrates that nicely .
The point being that they &apos;ve developed cultural adaptation .
And as we heard yesterday , that &apos;s the Pandora &apos;s box that &apos;s getting human beings in trouble , and we &apos;re starting to see it with them .
They &apos;re able to very quickly and very flexibly adapt to new challenges and new resources in their environment , which is really useful if you live in a city .
So we know that there &apos;s lots of crows .
We found out they &apos;re really smart , and we found out that they can teach each other .
And when all this became clear to me , I realized the only obvious thing to do is build a vending machine .
So that &apos;s what we did .
This is a vending machine for crows .
And it uses Skinnerian training to shape their behavior over four stages .
It &apos;s pretty simple .
Basically , what happens is that we put this out in a field , or someplace where there &apos;s lots of crows , and we put coins and peanuts all around the base of the machine .
And crows eventually come by , and eat the peanuts and get used to the machine being there .
And eventually , they eat up all the peanuts .
And then they see that there are peanuts here on the feeder tray , and they hop up and help themselves .
And then they leave , and the machine spits up more coins and peanuts , and life is really dandy , if you &apos;re a crow .
Then you can come back anytime and get yourself a peanut .
So , when they get really used to that , we move on to the crows coming back .
Now , they &apos;re used to the sound of the machine , and they keep coming back , and digging out these peanuts from amongst the pile of coins that &apos;s there .
And when they get really happy about this , we go ahead and stymie them .
And we move to the third stage , where we only give them a coin .
Now , like most of us who have gotten used to a good thing , this really pisses them off .
So , they do what they do in nature when they &apos;re looking for something -- they sweep things out of the way with their beak .
And they do that here , and that knocks the coins down the slot , and when that happens , they get a peanut .
And so this goes on for some time .
The crows learn that all they have to do is show up , wait for the coin to come out , put the coin in the slot , and then they get their peanut .
And when they &apos;re really good and comfortable with that , we move to the final stage , in which they show up and nothing happens .
And this is where we see the difference between crows and other animals .
Squirrels , for example , would show up , look for the peanut , go away .
Come back , look for the peanut , go away .
They do this maybe half a dozen times before they get bored , and then they go off and play in traffic .
Crows , on the other hand , show up , and they try and figure it out .
They know that this machine &apos;s been messing with them , through three different stages of behavior .
They figure it &apos;s gotta have more to it .
So , they poke at it and peck at it and whatnot .
And eventually some crow gets a bright idea that , &quot; Hey , there &apos;s lots of coins lying around from the first stage , lying around on the ground , &quot; hops down , picks it up , drops it in the slot .
And then , we &apos;re off to the races .
That crow enjoys a temporary monopoly on peanuts , until his friends figure out how to do it , and then there we go .
So , what &apos;s significant about this to me isn &apos;t that we can train crows to pick up peanuts .
Mind you , there &apos;s 216 million dollars &apos; worth of change lost every year , but I &apos;m not sure I can depend on that ROI from crows .
Instead , I think we should look a little bit larger .
I think that crows can be trained to do other things .
For example , why not train them to pick up garbage after stadium events ?
Or find expensive components from discarded electronics ?
Or maybe do search and rescue ?
The main thing , the main point of all this for me is that we can find mutually beneficial systems for these species .
We can find ways to interact with these other species that doesn &apos;t involve exterminating them , but involves finding an equilibrium with them that &apos;s a useful balance .
Thanks very much .

I wrote this poem after hearing a pretty well known actress tell a very well known interviewer on television , &quot; I &apos;m really getting into the Internet lately .
I just wish it were more organized . &quot;
So ...
If I controlled the Internet , you could auction your broken heart on eBay .
Take the money ; go to Amazon ; buy a phonebook for a country you &apos;ve never been to -- call folks at random until you find someone who flirts really well in a foreign language .
If I were in charge of the Internet , you could Mapquest your lover &apos;s mood swings .
Hang left at cranky , right at preoccupied , U-turn on silent treatment , all the way back to tongue kissing and good lovin &apos; .
You could navigate and understand every emotional intersection .
Some days , I &apos;m as shallow as a baking pan , but I still stretch miles in all directions .
If I owned the Internet , Napster , Monster and Friendster.com would be one big website .
That way you could listen to cool music while you pretend to look for a job and you &apos;re really just chattin &apos; with your pals .
Heck , if I ran the Web , you could email dead people .
They would not email you back -- but you &apos;d get an automated reply .
Their name in your inbox -- it &apos;s all you wanted anyway .
And a message saying , &quot; Hey , it &apos;s me . I miss you .
Listen , you &apos;ll see being dead is dandy .
Now you go back to raising kids and waging peace and craving candy . &quot;
If I designed the Internet , childhood.com would be a loop of a boy in an orchard , with a ski pole for a sword , trashcan lid for a shield , shouting , &quot; I am the emperor of oranges .
I am the emperor of oranges . I am the emperor of oranges . &quot;
Now follow me , OK ?
Grandma.com would be a recipe for biscuits and spit-bath instructions .
One , two , three .
That links with hotdiggitydog.com.
That is my grandfather .
They take you to gruff-ex-cop-on-his-fourth-marriage.dad.
He forms an attachment to kind-of-ditzy-but-still-sends-ginger-snaps-for-Christmas.mom , who downloads the boy in the orchard , the emperor of oranges , who grows up to be me -- the guy who usually goes too far .
So if I were emperor of the Internet , I guess I &apos;d still be mortal , huh ?
But at that point , I would probably already have the lowest possible mortgage and the most enlarged possible penis -- so I would outlaw spam on my first day in office .
I wouldn &apos;t need it .
I &apos;d be like some kind of Internet genius , and me , I &apos;d like to upgrade to deity and maybe just like that -- pop ! -- I &apos;d go wireless .
Huh ? Maybe Google would hire this .
I could zip through your servers and firewalls like a virus until the World Wide Web is as wise , as wild and as organized as I think a modern-day miracle / oracle can get , but , ooh-eee , you want to bet just how whack and un-PC your Mac or PC is going to be when I &apos;m rocking hot-shit-hot-shot-god.net ?
I guess it &apos;s just like life .
It is not a question of if you can -- it &apos;s : do ya ?
We can interfere with the interface .
We can make &quot; You &apos;ve got Hallelujah &quot; the national anthem of cyberspace every lucky time we log on .
You don &apos;t say a prayer .
You don &apos;t write a psalm .
You don &apos;t chant an &quot; om . &quot;
You send one blessed email to whomever you &apos;re thinking of at dah-da-la-dat-da-dah-da-la-dat.com.

Julian , welcome .
It &apos;s been reported that WikiLeaks , your baby , has , in the last few years has released more classified documents than the rest of the world &apos;s media combined .
Can that possibly be true ?
Julian Assange : Yeah , can it possibly be true ?
It &apos;s a worry -- isn &apos;t it ? -- that the rest of the world &apos;s media is doing such a bad job that a little group of activists is able to release more of that type of information than the rest of the world press combined .
How does it work ?
How do people release the documents ?
And how do you secure their privacy ?
J So these are -- as far as we can tell -- classical whistleblowers , and we have a number of ways for them to get information to us .
So we use this state-of-the-art encryption to bounce stuff around the Internet , to hide trails , pass it through legal jurisdictions like Sweden and Belgium to enact those legal protections .
We get information in the mail , the regular postal mail , encrypted or not , vet it like a regular news organization , format it -- which is sometimes something that &apos;s quite hard to do , when you &apos;re talking about giant databases of information -- release it to the public and then defend ourselves against the inevitable legal and political attacks .
So you make an effort to ensure the documents are legitimate , but you actually almost never know who the identity of the source is ?
J That &apos;s right , yeah . Very rarely do we ever know , and if we find out at some stage then we destroy that information as soon as possible .
God damn it .
I think that &apos;s the CIA asking what the code is for a TED membership .
So let &apos;s take &#91; an &#93; example , actually .
This is something you leaked a few years ago .
If we can have this document up ...
So this was a story in Kenya a few years ago .
Can you tell us what you leaked and what happened ?
J So this is the Kroll Report .
This was a secret intelligence report commissioned by the Kenyan government after its election in 2004 .
Prior to 2004 , Kenya was ruled by Daniel arap Moi for about 18 years .
He was a soft dictator of Kenya .
And when Kibaki got into power -- through a coalition of forces that were trying to clean up corruption in Kenya -- they commissioned this report , spent about two million pounds on this and an associated report .
And then the government sat on it and used it for political leverage on Moi , who was the richest man -- still is the richest man -- in Kenya .
It &apos;s the Holy Grail of Kenyan journalism .
So I went there in 2007 , and we managed to get hold of this just prior to the election -- the national election , December 28 .
When we released that report , we did so three days after the new president , Kibaki , had decided to pal up with the man that he was going to clean out , Daniel arap Moi , so this report then became a dead albatross around President Kibaki &apos;s neck .
And -- I mean , to cut a long story short -- word of the report leaked into Kenya , not from the official media , but indirectly , and in your opinion , it actually shifted the election .
J Yeah . So this became front page of the Guardian and was then printed in all the surrounding countries of Kenya , in Tanzanian and South African press .
And so it came in from the outside .
And that , after a couple of days , made the Kenyan press feel safe to talk about it .
And it ran for 20 nights straight on Kenyan TV , shifted the vote by 10 percent , according to a Kenyan intelligence report , which changed the result of the election .
Wow , so your leak really substantially changed the world ?
J Yep .
Here &apos;s -- We &apos;re going to just show a short clip from this Baghdad airstrike video .
The video itself is longer , but here &apos;s a short clip .
This is -- this is intense material , I should warn you .

J The impact on the people who worked on it was severe .
We ended up sending two people to Baghdad to further research that story .
So this is just the first of three attacks that occurred in that scene .
So , I mean , 11 people died in that attack , right , including two Reuters employees ?
J Yeah . Two Reuters employees , two young children were wounded .
There were between 18 and 26 people killed all together .
And releasing this caused widespread outrage .
What was the key element of this that actually caused the outrage , do you think ?
J I don &apos;t know . I guess people can see the gross disparity in force .
You have guys walking in a relaxed way down the street , and then an Apache helicopter sitting up at one kilometer firing 30-millimeter cannon shells on everyone -- looking for any excuse to do so -- and killing people rescuing the wounded .
And there was two journalists involved that clearly weren &apos;t insurgents because that &apos;s their full-time job .
I mean , there &apos;s been this U.S. intelligence analyst , Bradley Manning , arrested , and it &apos;s alleged that he confessed in a chat room to have leaked this video to you , along with 280,000 classified U.S. embassy cables .
I mean , did he ?
J We have denied receiving those cables .
He has been charged , about five days ago , with obtaining 150,000 cables and releasing 50 .
Now , we had released , early in the year , a cable from the Reykjavik U.S. embassy , but this is not necessarily connected .
I mean , I was a known visitor of that embassy .
I mean , if you did receive thousands of U.S. embassy diplomatic cables ...
J We would have released them .
J Yeah .
J Well , because these sort of things reveal what the true state of , say , Arab governments are like , the true human-rights abuses in those governments .
If you look at declassified cables , that &apos;s the sort of material that &apos;s there .
So let &apos;s talk a little more broadly about this .
I mean , in general , what &apos;s your philosophy ?
Why is it right to encourage leaking of secret information ?
J Well , there &apos;s a question as to what sort of information is important in the world , what sort of information can achieve reform .
And there &apos;s a lot of information .
So information that organizations are spending economic effort into concealing , that &apos;s a really good signal that when the information gets out , there &apos;s a hope of it doing some good -- because the organizations that know it best , that know it from the inside out , are spending work to conceal it .
And that &apos;s what we &apos;ve found in practice , and that &apos;s what the history of journalism is .
But are there risks with that , either to the individuals concerned or indeed to society at large , where leaking can actually have an unintended consequence ?
J Not that we have seen with anything we have released .
I mean , we have a harm immunization policy .
We have a way of dealing with information that has sort of personal -- personally identifying information in it .
But there are legitimate secrets -- you know , your records with your doctor ; that &apos;s a legitimate secret -- but we deal with whistleblowers that are coming forward that are really sort of well-motivated .
So they are well-motivated .
And what would you say to , for example , the , you know , the parent of someone whose son is out serving the U.S. military , and he says , &quot; You know what , you &apos;ve put up something that someone had an incentive to put out .
It shows a U.S. soldier laughing at people dying .
That gives the impression , has given the impression , to millions of people around the world that U.S. soldiers are inhuman people .
Actually , they &apos;re not . My son isn &apos;t . How dare you ? &quot;
What would you say to that ?
J Yeah , we do get a lot of that .
But remember , the people in Baghdad , the people in Iraq , the people in Afghanistan -- they don &apos;t need to see the video ; they see it every day .
So it &apos;s not going to change their opinion . It &apos;s not going to change their perception .
That &apos;s what they see every day .
It will change the perception and opinion of the people who are paying for it all , and that &apos;s our hope .
So you found a way to shine light into what you see as these sort of dark secrets in companies and in government .
Light is good .
But do you see any irony in the fact that , in order for you to shine that light , you have to , yourself , create secrecy around your sources ?
J Not really . I mean , we don &apos;t have any WikiLeaks dissidents yet .
We don &apos;t have sources who are dissidents on other sources .
Should they come forward , that would be a tricky situation for us , but we &apos;re presumably acting in such a way that people feel morally compelled to continue our mission , not to screw it up .
I &apos;d actually be interested , just based on what we &apos;ve heard so far -- I &apos;m curious as to the opinion in the TED audience .
You know , there might be a couple of views of WikiLeaks and of Julian .
You know , hero -- people &apos;s hero -- bringing this important light .
Dangerous troublemaker .
Who &apos;s got the hero view ?
Who &apos;s got the dangerous troublemaker view ?
J Oh , come on . There must be some .
It &apos;s a soft crowd , Julian , a soft crowd .
We have to try better . Let &apos;s show them another example .
Now here &apos;s something that you haven &apos;t yet leaked , but I think for TED you are .
I mean it &apos;s an intriguing story that &apos;s just happened , right ?
What is this ?
J So this is a sample of what we do sort of every day .
So late last year -- in November last year -- there was a series of well blowouts in Albania , like the well blowout in the Gulf of Mexico , but not quite as big .
And we got a report -- a sort of engineering analysis into what happened -- saying that , in fact , security guards from some rival , various competing oil firms had , in fact , parked trucks there and blown them up .
And part of the Albanian government was in this , etc . , etc .
And the engineering report had nothing on the top of it , so it was an extremely difficult document for us .
We couldn &apos;t verify it because we didn &apos;t know who wrote it and knew what it was about .
So we were kind of skeptical that maybe it was a competing oil firm just sort of playing the issue up .
So under that basis , we put it out and said , &quot; Look , we &apos;re skeptical about this thing .
We don &apos;t know , but what can we do ?
The material looks good , it feels right , but we just can &apos;t verify it . &quot;
And we then got a letter just this week from the company who wrote it , wanting to track down the source -- saying , &quot; Hey , we want to track down the source . &quot;
And we were like , &quot; Oh , tell us more .
What document is it , precisely , you &apos;re talking about ?
Can you show that you had legal authority over that document ?
Is it really yours ? &quot;
So they sent us this screen shot with the author in the Microsoft Word ID .
Yeah .
That &apos;s happened quite a lot though .
This is like one of our methods of identifying , of verifying , what a material is , is to try and get these guys to write letters .
Yeah . Have you had information from inside BP ?
J Yeah , we have a lot , but I mean , at the moment , we are undergoing a sort of serious fundraising and engineering effort .
So our publication rate over the past few months has been sort of minimized while we &apos;re re-engineering our back systems for the phenomenal public interest that we have .
That &apos;s a problem .
I mean , like any sort of growing startup organization , we are sort of overwhelmed by our growth , and that means we &apos;re getting enormous quantity of whistleblower disclosures of a very high caliber but don &apos;t have enough people to actually process and vet this information .
So that &apos;s the key bottleneck , basically journalistic volunteers and / or the funding of journalistic salaries ?
J Yep . Yeah , and trusted people .
I mean , we &apos;re an organization that is hard to grow very quickly because of the sort of material we deal with , so we have to restructure in order to have people who will deal with the highest national security stuff , and then lower security cases .
So help us understand a bit about you personally and how you came to do this .
And I think I read that as a kid you went to 37 different schools .
Can that be right ?
J Well , my parents were in the movie business and then on the run from a cult , so the combination between the two ...
I mean , a psychologist might say that &apos;s a recipe for breeding paranoia .
J What , the movie business ?
And you were also -- I mean , you were also a hacker at an early age and ran into the authorities early on .
J Well , I was a journalist .
You know , I was a very young journalist activist at an early age .
I wrote a magazine , was prosecuted for it when I was a teenager .
So you have to be careful with hacker .
I mean there &apos;s like -- there &apos;s a method that can be deployed for various things .
Unfortunately , at the moment , it &apos;s mostly deployed by the Russian mafia in order to steal your grandmother &apos;s bank accounts .
So this phrase is not , not as nice as it used to be .
Yeah , well , I certainly don &apos;t think you &apos;re stealing anyone &apos;s grandmother &apos;s bank account , but what about your core values ?
Can you give us a sense of what they are and maybe some incident in your life that helped determine them ?
J I &apos;m not sure about the incident .
But the core values : well , capable , generous men do not create victims ; they nurture victims .
And that &apos;s something from my father and something from other capable , generous men that have been in my life .
Capable , generous men do not create victims ; they nurture victims ?
J Yeah . And you know , I &apos;m a combative person , so I &apos;m not actually so big on the nurture , but some way -- there is another way of nurturing victims , which is to police perpetrators of crime .
And so that is something that has been in my character for a long time .
So just tell us , very quickly in the last minute , the story : what happened in Iceland ?
You basically published something there , ran into trouble with a bank , then the news service there was injuncted from running the story .
Instead , they publicized your side .
That made you very high-profile in Iceland . What happened next ?
J Yeah , this is a great case , you know .
Iceland went through this financial crisis .
It was the hardest hit of any country in the world .
Its banking sector was 10 times the GDP of the rest of the economy .
Anyway , so we release this report in July last year .
And the national TV station was injuncted five minutes before it went on air , like out of a movie : injunction landed on the news desk , and the news reader was like , &quot; This has never happened before . What do we do ? &quot;
Well , we just show the website instead , for all that time , as a filler , and we became very famous in Iceland , went to Iceland and spoke about this issue .
And there was a feeling in the community that that should never happen again , and as a result , working with Icelandic politicians and some other international legal experts , we put together a new sort of package of legislation for Iceland to sort of become an offshore haven for the free press , with the strongest journalistic protections in the world , with a new Nobel Prize for freedom of speech .
Iceland &apos;s a Nordic country , so , like Norway , it &apos;s able to tap into the system .
And just a month ago , this was passed by the Icelandic parliament unanimously .
Wow .
Last question , Julian .
When you think of the future then , do you think it &apos;s more likely to be Big Brother exerting more control , more secrecy , or us watching Big Brother , or it &apos;s just all to be played for either way ?
J I &apos;m not sure which way it &apos;s going to go .
I mean , there &apos;s enormous pressures to harmonize freedom of speech legislation and transparency legislation around the world -- within the E.U. , between China and the United States .
Which way is it going to go ? It &apos;s hard to see .
That &apos;s why it &apos;s a very interesting time to be in -- because with just a little bit of effort , we can shift it one way or the other .
Well , it looks like I &apos;m reflecting the audience &apos;s opinion to say , Julian , be careful , and all power to you .
J Thank you , Chris .

&lt; title &gt; Julian Assange : Why the world needs WikiLeaks &lt; / title &gt;
&lt; description &gt; The controversial website WikiLeaks collects and posts highly classified documents and video . Founder Julian Assange , who &apos;s reportedly being sought for questioning by US authorities , talks to TED &apos;s Chris Anderson about how the site operates , what it has accomplished -- and what drives him . The interview includes graphic footage of a recent US airstrike in Baghdad . &lt; / description &gt;

What you just heard are the interactions of barometric pressure , wind and temperature readings that were recorded of Hurricane Noel in 2007 .
The musicians played off a three-dimensional graph of weather data like this .
Every single bead , every single colored band , represents a weather element that can also be read as a musical note .
I find weather extremely fascinating .
Weather is an amalgam of systems that is inherently invisible to most of us .
So I use sculpture and music to make it , not just visible , but also tactile and audible .
All of my work begins very simple .
I extract information from a specific environment using very low-tech data collecting devices -- generally anything I can find in the hardware store .
I then compare my information to the things I find on the Internet -- satellite images , weather data from weather stations as well as offshore buoys .
That &apos;s both historical as well as real data .
And then I compile all of these numbers on these clipboards that you see here .
These clipboards are filled with numbers .
And from all of these numbers , I start with only two or three variables .
That begins my translation process .
My translation medium is a very simple basket .
A basket is made up of horizontal and vertical elements .
When I assign values to the vertical and horizontal elements , I can use the changes of those data points over time to create the form .
I use natural reed , because natural reed has a lot of tension in it that I cannot fully control .
That means that it is the numbers that control the form , not me .
What I come up with are forms like these .
These forms are completely made up of weather data or science data .
Every colored bead , every colored string , represents a weather element .
And together , these elements , not only construct the form , but they also reveal behavioral relationships that may not come across through a two-dimensional graph .
When you step closer , you actually see that it is indeed all made up of numbers .
The vertical elements are assigned a specific hour of the day .
So all the way around , you have a 24-hour timeline .
But it &apos;s also used to assign a temperature range .
On that grid , I can then weave the high tide readings , water temperature , air temperature and Moon phases .
I also translate weather data into musical scores .
And musical notation allows me a more nuanced way of translating information without compromising it .
So all of these scores are made up of weather data .
Every single color , dot , every single line , is a weather element .
And together , these variables construct a score .
I use these scores to collaborate with musicians .
This is the 1913 Trio performing one of my pieces at the Milwaukee Art Museum .
Meanwhile , I use these scores as blueprints to translate into sculptural forms like this , that function still in the sense of being a three-dimensional weather visualization , but now they &apos;re embedding the visual matrix of the musical score , so it can actually be read as a musical score .
What I love about this work is that it challenges our assumptions of what kind of visual vocabulary belongs in the world of art , versus science .
This piece here is read very differently depending on where you place it .
You place it in an art museum , it becomes a sculpture .
You place it in a science museum , it becomes a three-dimensional visualization of data .
You place it in a music hall , it all of a sudden becomes a musical score .
And I really like that , because the viewer is really challenged as to what visual language is part of science versus art versus music .
The other reason why I really like this is because it offers an alternative entry point into the complexity of science .
And not everyone has a Ph.D. in science .
So for me , that was my way into it .
Thank you .

I want to talk about the transformed media landscape , and what it means for anybody who has a message that they want to get out to anywhere in the world .
And I want to illustrate that by telling a couple of stories about that transformation .
I &apos;ll start here . Last November there was a presidential election .
You probably read something about it in the papers .
And there was some concern that in some parts of the country there might be voter suppression .
And so a plan came up to video the vote .
And the idea was that individual citizens with phones capable of taking photos or making video would document their polling places , on the lookout for any kind of voter suppression techniques , and would upload this to a central place .
And that this would operate as a kind of citizen observation -- that citizens would not be there just to cast individual votes , but also to help ensure the sanctity of the vote overall .
So this is a pattern that assumes we &apos;re all in this together .
What matters here isn &apos;t technical capital , it &apos;s social capital .
These tools don &apos;t get socially interesting until they get technologically boring .
It isn &apos;t when the shiny new tools show up that their uses start permeating society .
It &apos;s when everybody is able to take them for granted .
Because now that media is increasingly social , innovation can happen anywhere that people can take for granted the idea that we &apos;re all in this together .
And so we &apos;re starting to see a media landscape in which innovation is happening everywhere , and moving from one spot to another .
That is a huge transformation .
Not to put too fine a point on it , the moment we &apos;re living through -- the moment our historical generation is living through -- is the largest increase in expressive capability in human history .
Now that &apos;s a big claim . I &apos;m going to try to back it up .
There are only four periods in the last 500 years where media has changed enough to qualify for the label &quot; revolution . &quot;
The first one is the famous one , the printing press : movable type , oil-based inks , that whole complex of innovations that made printing possible and turned Europe upside-down , starting in the middle of the 1400s .
Then , a couple of hundred years ago , there was innovation in two-way communication , conversational media : first the telegraph , then the telephone .
Slow , text-based conversations , then real-time voice based conversations .
Then , about 150 years ago , there was a revolution in recorded media other than print : first photos , then recorded sound , then movies , all encoded onto physical objects .
And finally , about 100 years ago , the harnessing of electromagnetic spectrum to send sound and images through the air -- radio and television .
This is the media landscape as we knew it in the 20th century .
This is what those of us of a certain age grew up with , and are used to .
But there is a curious asymmetry here .
The media that is good at creating conversations is no good at creating groups .
And the media that &apos;s good at creating groups is no good at creating conversations .
If you want to have a conversation in this world , you have it with one other person .
If you want to address a group , you get the same message and you give it to everybody in the group , whether you &apos;re doing that with a broadcasting tower or a printing press .
That was the media landscape as we had it in the twentieth century .
And this is what changed .
This thing that looks like a peacock hit a windscreen is Bill Cheswick &apos;s map of the Internet .
He traces the edges of the individual networks and then color codes them .
The Internet is the first medium in history that has native support for groups and conversation at the same time .
Whereas the phone gave us the one-to-one pattern , and television , radio , magazines , books , gave us the one-to-many pattern , the Internet gives us the many-to-many pattern .
For the first time , media is natively good at supporting these kinds of conversations .
That &apos;s one of the big changes .
The second big change is that , as all media gets digitized , the Internet also becomes the mode of carriage for all other media , meaning that phone calls migrate to the Internet , magazines migrate to the Internet , movies migrate to the Internet .
And that means that every medium is right next door to every other medium .
Put another way , media is increasingly less just a source of information , and it is increasingly more a site of coordination , because groups that see or hear or watch or listen to something can now gather around and talk to each other as well .
And the third big change is that members of the former audience , as Dan Gilmore calls them , can now also be producers and not consumers .
Every time a new consumer joins this media landscape a new producer joins as well , because the same equipment -- phones , computers -- let you consume and produce .
It &apos;s as if , when you bought a book , they threw in the printing press for free ; it &apos;s like you had a phone that could turn into a radio if you pressed the right buttons .
That is a huge change in the media landscape we &apos;re used to .
And it &apos;s not just Internet or no Internet .
We &apos;ve had the Internet in its public form for almost 20 years now , and it &apos;s still changing as the media becomes more social .
It &apos;s still changing patterns even among groups who know how to deal with the Internet well .
Second story .
Last May , China in the Sichuan province had a terrible earthquake , 7.9 magnitude , massive destruction in a wide area , as the Richter Scale has it .
And the earthquake was reported as it was happening .
People were texting from their phones . They were taking photos of buildings .
They were taking videos of buildings shaking .
They were uploading it to QQ , China &apos;s largest Internet service .
They were Twittering it .
And so as the quake was happening the news was reported .
And because of the social connections , Chinese students coming elsewhere , and going to school , or businesses in the rest of the world opening offices in China -- there were people listening all over the world , hearing this news .
The BBC got their first wind of the Chinese quake from Twitter .
Twitter announced the existence of the quake several minutes before the US Geological Survey had anything up online for anybody to read .
The last time China had a quake of that magnitude it took them three months to admit that it had happened .
Now they might have liked to have done that here , rather than seeing these pictures go up online .
But they weren &apos;t given that choice , because their own citizens beat them to the punch .
Even the government learned of the earthquake from their own citizens , rather than from the Xinhua News Agency .
And this stuff rippled like wildfire .
For a while there the top 10 most clicked links on Twitter , the global short messaging service -- nine of the top 10 links were about the quake .
People collating information , pointing people to news sources , pointing people to the US geological survey .
The 10th one was kittens on a treadmill , but that &apos;s the Internet for you .
But nine of the 10 in those first hours .
And within half a day donation sites were up , and donations were pouring in from all around the world .
This was an incredible , coordinated global response .
And the Chinese then , in one of their periods of media openness , decided that they were going to let it go , that they were going to let this citizen reporting fly .
And then this happened .
People began to figure out , in the Sichuan Provence , that the reason so many school buildings had collapsed -- because tragically the earthquake happened during a school day -- the reason so many school buildings collapsed is that corrupt officials had taken bribes to allow those building to be built to less than code .
And so they started , the citizen journalists started reporting that as well . And there was an incredible picture .
You may have seen in on the front page of the New York Times .
A local official literally prostrated himself in the street , in front of these protesters , in order to get them to go away .
Essentially to say , &quot; We will do anything to placate you , just please stop protesting in public . &quot;
But these are people who have been radicalized , because , thanks to the one child policy , they have lost everyone in their next generation .
Someone who has seen the death of a single child now has nothing to lose .
And so the protest kept going .
And finally the Chinese cracked down .
That was enough of citizen media .
And so they began to arrest the protesters .
They began to shut down the media that the protests were happening on .
China is probably the most successful manager of Internet censorship in the world , using something that is widely described as the Great Firewall of China .
And the Great Firewall of China is a set of observation points that assume that media is produced by professionals , it mostly comes in from the outside world , it comes in relatively sparse chunks , and it comes in relatively slowly .
And because of those four characteristics they are able to filter it as it comes into the country .
But like the Maginot Line , the great firewall of China was facing in the wrong direction for this challenge , because not one of those four things was true in this environment .
The media was produced locally . It was produced by amateurs .
It was produced quickly . And it was produced at such an incredible abundance that there was no way to filter it as it appeared .
And so now the Chinese government , who for a dozen years , has quite successfully filtered the web , is now in the position of having to decide whether to allow or shut down entire services , because the transformation to amateur media is so enormous that they can &apos;t deal with it any other way .
And in fact that is happening this week .
On the 20th anniversary of Tiananmen they just , two days ago , announced that they were simply shutting down access to Twitter , because there was no way to filter it other than that .
They had to turn the spigot entirely off .
Now these changes don &apos;t just affect people who want to censor messages .
They also affect people who want to send messages , because this is really a transformation of the ecosystem as a whole , not just a particular strategy .
The classic media problem , from the 20th century is , how does an organization have a message that they want to get out to a group of people distributed at the edges of a network .
And here is the twentieth century answer .
Bundle up the message . Send the same message to everybody .
National message . Targeted individuals .
Relatively sparse number of producers .
Very expensive to do , so there is not a lot of competition .
This is how you reach people .
All of that is over .
We are increasingly in a landscape where media is global , social , ubiquitous and cheap .
Now most organizations that are trying to send messages to the outside world , to the distributed collection of the audience , are now used to this change .
The audience can talk back .
And that &apos;s a little freaky . But you can get used to it after a while , as people do .
But that &apos;s not the really crazy change that we &apos;re living in the middle of .
The really crazy change is here : it &apos;s the fact that they are no longer disconnected from each other , the fact that former consumers are now producers , the fact that the audience can talk directly to one another ; because there is a lot more amateurs than professionals , and because the size of the network , the complexity of the network is actually the square of the number of participants , meaning that the network , when it grows large , grows very , very large .
As recently at last decade , most of the media that was available for public consumption was produced by professionals .
Those days are over , never to return .
It is the green lines now , that are the source of the free content , which brings me to my last story .
We saw some of the most imaginative use of social media during the Obama campaign .
And I don &apos;t mean most imaginative use in politics -- I mean most imaginative use ever .
And one of the things Obama did , was they famously , the Obama campaign did , was they famously put up MyBarackObama.com , myBO.com And millions of citizens rushed in to participate , and to try and figure out how to help .
An incredible conversation sprung up there .
And then , this time last year , Obama announced that he was going to change his vote on FISA , The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act .
He had said , in January , that he would not sign a bill that granted telecom immunity for possibly warrantless spying on American persons .
By the summer , in the middle of the general campaign , He said , &quot; I &apos;ve thought about the issue more . I &apos;ve changed my mind .
I &apos;m going to vote for this bill . &quot;
And many of his own supporters on his own site went very publicly berserk .
It was Senator Obama when they created it . They changed the name later .
&quot; Please get FISA right . &quot;
Within days of this group being created it was the fastest growing group on myBO.com ; within weeks of its being created it was the largest group .
Obama had to issue a press release .
He had to issue a reply .
And he said essentially , &quot; I have considered the issue .
I understand where you are coming from .
But having considered it all , I &apos;m still going to vote the way I &apos;m going to vote .
But I wanted to reach out to you and say , I understand that you disagree with me , and I &apos;m going to take my lumps on this one . &quot;
This didn &apos;t please anybody . But then a funny thing happened in the conversation .
People in that group realized that Obama had never shut them down .
Nobody in the Obama campaign had ever tried to hide the group or make it harder to join , to deny its existence , to delete it , to take to off the site .
They had understood that their role with myBO.com was to convene their supporters but not to control their supporters .
And that is the kind of discipline that it takes to make really mature use of this media .
Media , the media landscape that we knew , as familiar as it was , as easy conceptually as it was to deal with the idea that professionals broadcast messages to amateurs , is increasingly slipping away .
In a world where media is global , social , ubiquitous and cheap , in a world of media where the former audience are now increasingly full participants , in that world , media is less and less often about crafting a single message to be consumed by individuals .
It is more and more often a way of creating an environment for convening and supporting groups .
And the choice we face , I mean anybody who has a message they want to have heard anywhere in the world , isn &apos;t whether or not that is the media environment we want to operate in .
That &apos;s the media environment we &apos;ve got .
The question we all face now is , &quot; How can we make best use of this media ?
Even though it means changing the way we &apos;ve always done it . &quot;
Thank you very much .

I was speaking to a group of about 300 kids , ages six to eight , at a children &apos;s museum , and I brought with me a bag full of legs , similar to the kinds of things you see up here , and had them laid out on a table for the kids .
And , from my experience , you know , kids are naturally curious about what they don &apos;t know , or don &apos;t understand , or is foreign to them .
They only learn to be frightened of those differences when an adult influences them to behave that way , and maybe censors that natural curiosity , or you know , reins in the question-asking in the hopes of them being polite little kids .
So I just pictured a first grade teacher out in the lobby with these unruly kids , saying , &quot; Now , whatever you do , don &apos;t stare at her legs . &quot;
But , of course , that &apos;s the point .
That &apos;s why I was there , I wanted to invite them to look and explore .
So I made a deal with the adults that the kids could come in without any adults for two minutes on their own .
The doors open , the kids descend on this table of legs , and they are poking and prodding , and they &apos;re wiggling toes , and they &apos;re trying to put their full weight on the sprinting leg to see what happens with that .
And I said , &quot; Kids , really quickly -- I woke up this morning , I decided I wanted to be able to jump over a house -- nothing too big , two or three stories -- but , if you could think of any animal , any superhero , any cartoon character , anything you can dream up right now , what kind of legs would you build me ? &quot;
And immediately a voice shouted , &quot; Kangaroo ! &quot;
&quot; No , no , no ! Should be a frog ! &quot;
&quot; No . It should be Go Go Gadget ! &quot;
&quot; No , no , no ! It should be the Incredibles . &quot;
And other things that I don &apos;t -- aren &apos;t familiar with .
And then , one eight-year-old said , &quot; Hey , why wouldn &apos;t you want to fly too ? &quot;
And the whole room , including me , was like , &quot; Yeah . &quot;
And just like that , I went from being a woman that these kids would have been trained to see as &quot; disabled &quot; to somebody that had potential that their bodies didn &apos;t have yet .
Somebody that might even be super-abled .
Interesting .
So some of you actually saw me at TED , 11 years ago .
And there &apos;s been a lot of talk about how life-changing this conference is for both speakers and attendees , and I am no exception .
TED literally was the launch pad to the next decade of my life &apos;s exploration .
At the time , the legs I presented were groundbreaking in prosthetics .
I had woven carbon fiber sprinting legs modeled after the hind leg of a cheetah , which you may have seen on stage yesterday .
And also these very life-like , intrinsically painted silicone legs .
So at the time , it was my opportunity to put a call out to innovators outside the traditional medical prosthetic community to come bring their talent to the science and to the art of building legs .
So that we can stop compartmentalizing form , function and aesthetic , and assigning them different values .
Well , lucky for me , a lot of people answered that call .
And the journey started , funny enough , with a TED conference attendee -- Chee Pearlman , who hopefully is in the audience somewhere today .
She was the editor then of a magazine called ID , and she gave me a cover story .
This started an incredible journey .
Curious encounters were happening to me at the time ; I &apos;d been accepting numerous invitations to speak on the design of the cheetah legs around the world .
And people would come up to me after the conference , after my talk , men and women .
And the conversation would go something like this , &quot; You know Aimee , you &apos;re very attractive .
You don &apos;t look disabled . &quot;
I thought , &quot; Well , that &apos;s amazing , because I don &apos;t feel disabled . &quot;
And it really opened my eyes to this conversation that could be explored , about beauty .
What does a beautiful woman have to look like ?
What is a sexy body ?
And interestingly , from an identity standpoint , what does it mean to have a disability ?
I mean , people -- Pamela Anderson has more prosthetic in her body than I do .
Nobody calls her disabled .
So this magazine , through the hands of graphic designer Peter Saville , went to fashion designer Alexander McQueen , and photographer Nick Knight , who were also interested in exploring that conversation .
So , three months after TED I found myself on a plane to London , doing my first fashion shoot , which resulted in this cover -- &quot; Fashion-able &quot; ?
Three months after that , I did my first runway show for Alexander McQueen on a pair of hand-carved wooden legs made from solid ash .
Nobody knew -- everyone thought they were wooden boots .
Actually , I have them on stage with me : grapevines , magnolias -- truly stunning .
Poetry matters .
Poetry is what elevates the banal and neglected object to a realm of art .
It can transform the thing that might have made people fearful into something that invites them to look , and look a little longer , and maybe even understand .
I learned this firsthand with my next adventure .
The artist Matthew Barney , in his film opus called the &quot; The Cremaster Cycle . &quot;
This is where it really hit home for me -- that my legs could be wearable sculpture .
And even at this point , I started to move away from the need to replicate human-ness as the only aesthetic ideal .
So we made what people lovingly referred to as glass legs even though they &apos;re actually optically clear polyurethane , a.k.a. bowling ball material .
Heavy !
Then we made these legs that are cast in soil with a potato root system growing in them , and beetroots out the top , and a very lovely brass toe .
That &apos;s a good close-up of that one .
Then another character was a half-woman , half-cheetah -- a little homage to my life as an athlete .
14 hours of prosthetic make-up to get into a creature that had articulated paws , claws and a tail that whipped around , like a gecko .
And then another pair of legs we collaborated on were these -- look like jellyfish legs , also polyurethane .
And the only purpose that these legs can serve , outside the context of the film , is to provoke the senses and ignite the imagination .
So whimsy matters .
Today , I have over a dozen pair of prosthetic legs that various people have made for me , and with them I have different negotiations of the terrain under my feet , and I can change my height -- I have a variable of five different heights .
Today , I &apos;m 6 &apos; 1 &quot; .
And I had these legs made a little over a year ago at Dorset Orthopedic in England and when I brought them home to Manhattan , my first night out on the town , I went to a very fancy party .
And a girl was there who has known me for years at my normal 5 &apos; 8 &quot; .
Her mouth dropped open when she saw me , and she went , &quot; But you &apos;re so tall ! &quot;
And I said , &quot; I know . Isn &apos;t it fun ? &quot;
I mean , it &apos;s a little bit like wearing stilts on stilts , but I have an entirely new relationship to door jams that I never expected I would ever have .
And I was having fun with it .
And she looked at me , and she said , &quot; But , Aimee , that &apos;s not fair . &quot;
And the incredible thing was she really meant it .
It &apos;s not fair that you can change your height , as you want it .
And that &apos;s when I knew -- that &apos;s when I knew that the conversation with society has changed profoundly in this last decade .
It is no longer a conversation about overcoming deficiency .
It &apos;s a conversation about augmentation .
It &apos;s a conversation about potential .
A prosthetic limb doesn &apos;t represent the need to replace loss anymore .
It can stand as a symbol that the wearer has the power to create whatever it is that they want to create in that space .
So people that society once considered to be disabled can now become the architects of their own identities and indeed continue to change those identities by designing their bodies from a place of empowerment .
And what is exciting to me so much right now is that by combining cutting-edge technology -- robotics , bionics -- with the age-old poetry , we are moving closer to understanding our collective humanity .
I think that if we want to discover the full potential in our humanity , we need to celebrate those heartbreaking strengths and those glorious disabilities that we all have .
I think of Shakespeare &apos;s Shylock : &quot; If you prick us , do we not bleed , and if you tickle us , do we not laugh ? &quot;
It is our humanity , and all the potential within it , that makes us beautiful .
Thank you .

The night before I was heading for Scotland , I was invited to host the final of &quot; China &apos;s Got Talent &quot; show in Shanghai with the 80,000 live audience in the stadium .
Guess who was the performing guest ?
Susan Boyle .
And I told her , &quot; I &apos;m going to Scotland the next day . &quot;
She sang beautifully , and she even managed to say a few words in Chinese : 送你葱 So it &apos;s not like &quot; hello &quot; or &quot; thank you , &quot; that ordinary stuff .
It means &quot; green onion for free . &quot;
Why did she say that ?
Because it was a line from our Chinese parallel Susan Boyle -- a 50-some year-old woman , a vegetable vendor in Shanghai , who loves singing Western opera , but she didn &apos;t understand any English or French or Italian , so she managed to fill in the lyrics with vegetable names in Chinese .
And the last sentence of Nessun Dorma that she was singing in the stadium was &quot; green onion for free . &quot;
So &#91; as &#93; Susan Boyle was saying that , 80,000 live audience sang together .
That was hilarious .
So I guess both Susan Boyle and this vegetable vendor in Shanghai belonged to otherness .
They were the least expected to be successful in the business called entertainment , yet their courage and talent brought them through .
And a show and a platform gave them the stage to realize their dreams .
Well , being different is not that difficult .
We are all different from different perspectives .
But I think being different is good , because you present a different point of view .
You may have the chance to make a difference .
My generation has been very fortunate to witness and participate in the historic transformation of China that has made so many changes in the past 20 , 30 years .
I remember that in the year of 1990 , when I was graduating from college , I was applying for a job in the sales department of the first five-star hotel in Beijing , Great Wall Sheraton -- it &apos;s still there .
So after being interrogated by this Japanese manager for a half an hour , he finally said , &quot; So , Miss Yang , do you have any questions to ask me ? &quot;
I summoned my courage and poise and said , &quot; Yes , but could you let me know , what actually do you sell ? &quot;
I didn &apos;t have a clue what a sales department was about in a five-star hotel .
That was the first day I set my foot in a five-star hotel .
Around the same time , I was going through an audition -- the first ever open audition by national television in China -- with another thousand college girls .
The producer told us they were looking for some sweet , innocent and beautiful fresh face .
So when it was my turn , I stood up and said , &quot; Why &#91; do &#93; women &apos;s personalities on television always have to be beautiful , sweet , innocent and , you know , supportive ?
Why can &apos;t they have their own ideas and their own voice ? &quot;
I thought I kind of offended them .
But actually , they were impressed by my words .
And so I was in the second round of competition , and then the third and the fourth .
After seven rounds of competition , I was the last one to survive it .
So I was on a national television prime-time show .
And believe it or not , that was the first show on Chinese television that allowed its hosts to speak out of their own minds without reading an approved script .
And my weekly audience at that time was between 200 to 300 million people .
Well after a few years , I decided to go to the U.S. and Columbia University to pursue my postgraduate studies , and then started my own media company , which was unthought of during the years that I started my career .
So we do a lot of things .
I &apos;ve interviewed more than a thousand people in the past .
And sometimes I have young people approaching me say , &quot; Lan , you changed my life , &quot; and I feel proud of that .
But then we are also so fortunate to witness the transformation of the whole country .
I was in Beijing &apos;s bidding for the Olympic Games .
I was representing the Shanghai Expo .
I saw China embracing the world and vice versa .
But then sometimes I &apos;m thinking , what are today &apos;s young generation up to ?
How are they different , and what are the differences they are going to make to shape the future of China , or at large , the world ?
So today I want to talk about young people through the platform of social media .
First of all , who are they ? &#91; What &#93; do they look like ?
Well this is a girl called Guo Meimei -- 20 years old , beautiful .
She showed off her expensive bags , clothes and car on her microblog , which is the Chinese version of Twitter .
And she claimed to be the general manager of Red Cross at the Chamber of Commerce .
She didn &apos;t realize that she stepped on a sensitive nerve and aroused national questioning , almost a turmoil , against the credibility of Red Cross .
The controversy was so heated that the Red Cross had to open a press conference to clarify it , and the investigation is going on .
So far , as of today , we know that she herself made up that title -- probably because she feels proud to be associated with charity .
All those expensive items were given to her as gifts by her boyfriend , who used to be a board member in a subdivision of Red Cross at Chamber of Commerce .
It &apos;s very complicated to explain .
But anyway , the public still doesn &apos;t buy it .
It is still boiling .
It shows us a general mistrust of government or government-backed institutions , which lacked transparency in the past .
And also it showed us the power and the impact of social media as microblog .
Microblog boomed in the year of 2010 , with visitors doubled and time spent on it tripled .
Sina.com , a major news portal , alone has more than 140 million microbloggers .
On Tencent , 200 million .
The most popular blogger -- it &apos;s not me -- it &apos;s a movie star , and she has more than 9.5 million followers , or fans .
About 80 percent of those microbloggers are young people , under 30 years old .
And because , as you know , the traditional media is still heavily controlled by the government , social media offers an opening to let the steam out a little bit .
But because you don &apos;t have many other openings , the heat coming out of this opening is sometimes very strong , active and even violent .
So through microblogging , we are able to understand Chinese youth even better .
So how are they different ?
First of all , most of them were born in the 80s and 90s , under the one-child policy .
And because of selected abortion by families who favored boys to girls , now we have ended up with 30 million more young men than women .
That could pose a potential danger to the society , but who knows ; we &apos;re in a globalized world , so they can look for girlfriends from other countries .
Most of them have fairly good education .
The illiteracy rate in China among this generation is under one percent .
In cities , 80 percent of kids go to college .
But they are facing an aging China with a population above 65 years old coming up with seven-point-some percent this year , and about to be 15 percent by the year of 2030 .
And you know we have the tradition that younger generations support the elders financially , and taking care of them when they &apos;re sick .
So it means young couples will have to support four parents who have a life expectancy of 73 years old .
So making a living is not that easy for young people .
College graduates are not in short supply .
In urban areas , college graduates find the starting salary is about 400 U.S. dollars a month , while the average rent is above $ 500 .
So what do they do ? They have to share space -- squeezed in very limited space to save money -- and they call themselves &quot; tribe of ants . &quot;
And for those who are ready to get married and buy their apartment , they figured out they have to work for 30 to 40 years to afford their first apartment .
That ratio in America would only cost a couple five years to earn , but in China it &apos;s 30 to 40 years with the skyrocketing real estate price .
Among the 200 million migrant workers , 60 percent of them are young people .
They find themselves sort of sandwiched between the urban areas and the rural areas .
Most of them don &apos;t want to go back to the countryside , but they don &apos;t have the sense of belonging .
They work for longer hours with less income , less social welfare .
And they &apos;re more vulnerable to job losses , subject to inflation , tightening loans from banks , appreciation of the renminbi , or decline of demand from Europe or America for the products they produce .
Last year , though , an appalling incident in a southern OEM manufacturing compound in China : 13 young workers in their late teens and early 20s committed suicide , just one by one like causing a contagious disease .
But they died because of all different personal reasons .
But this whole incident aroused a huge outcry from society about the isolation , both physical and mental , of these migrant workers .
For those who do return back to the countryside , they find themselves very welcome locally , because with the knowledge , skills and networks they have learned in the cities , with the assistance of the Internet , they &apos;re able to create more jobs , upgrade local agriculture and create new business in the less developed market .
So for the past few years , the coastal areas , they found themselves in a shortage of labor .
These diagrams show a more general social background .
The first one is the Engels coefficient , which explains that the cost of daily necessities has dropped its percentage all through the past decade , in terms of family income , to about 37-some percent .
But then in the last two years , it goes up again to 39 percent , indicating a rising living cost .
The Gini coefficient has already passed the dangerous line of 0.4 .
Now it &apos;s 0.5 -- even worse than that in America -- showing us the income inequality .
And so you see this whole society getting frustrated about losing some of its mobility .
And also , the bitterness and even resentment towards the rich and the powerful is quite widespread .
So any accusations of corruption or backdoor dealings between authorities or business would arouse a social outcry or even unrest .
So through some of the hottest topics on microblogging , we can see what young people care most about .
Social justice and government accountability runs the first in what they demand .
For the past decade or so , a massive urbanization and development have let us witness a lot of reports on the forced demolition of private property .
And it has aroused huge anger and frustration among our young generation .
Sometimes people get killed , and sometimes people set themselves on fire to protest .
So when these incidents are reported more and more frequently on the Internet , people cry for the government to take actions to stop this .
So the good news is that earlier this year , the state council passed a new regulation on house requisition and demolition and passed the right to order forced demolition from local governments to the court .
Similarly , many other issues concerning public safety is a hot topic on the Internet .
We heard about polluted air , polluted water , poisoned food .
And guess what , we have faked beef .
They have sorts of ingredients that you brush on a piece of chicken or fish , and it turns it to look like beef .
And then lately , people are very concerned about cooking oil , because thousands of people have been found &#91; refining &#93; cooking oil from restaurant slop .
So all these things have aroused a huge outcry from the Internet .
And fortunately , we have seen the government responding more timely and also more frequently to the public concerns .
While young people seem to be very sure about their participation in public policy-making , but sometimes they &apos;re a little bit lost in terms of what they want for their personal life .
China is soon to pass the U.S.
as the number one market for luxury brands -- that &apos;s not including the Chinese expenditures in Europe and elsewhere .
But you know what , half of those consumers are earning a salary below 2,000 U.S. dollars .
They &apos;re not rich at all .
They &apos;re taking those bags and clothes as a sense of identity and social status .
And this is a girl explicitly saying on a TV dating show that she would rather cry in a BMW than smile on a bicycle .
But of course , we do have young people who would still prefer to smile , whether in a BMW or &#91; on &#93; a bicycle .
So in the next picture , you see a very popular phenomenon called &quot; naked &quot; wedding , or &quot; naked &quot; marriage .
It does not mean they will wear nothing in the wedding , but it shows that these young couples are ready to get married without a house , without a car , without a diamond ring and without a wedding banquet , to show their commitment to true love .
And also , people are doing good through social media .
And the first picture showed us that a truck caging 500 homeless and kidnapped dogs for food processing was spotted and stopped on the highway with the whole country watching through microblogging .
People were donating money , dog food and offering volunteer work to stop that truck .
And after hours of negotiation , 500 dogs were rescued .
And here also people are helping to find missing children .
A father posted his son &apos;s picture onto the Internet .
After thousands of resends in relay , the child was found , and we witnessed the reunion of the family through microblogging .
So happiness is the most popular word we have heard through the past two years .
Happiness is not only related to personal experiences and personal values , but also , it &apos;s about the environment .
People are thinking about the following questions : Are we going to sacrifice our environment further to produce higher GDP ?
How are we going to perform our social and political reform to keep pace with economic growth , to keep sustainability and stability ?
And also , how capable is the system of self-correctness to keep more people content with all sorts of friction going on at the same time ?
I guess these are the questions people are going to answer .
And our younger generation are going to transform this country while at the same time being transformed themselves .
Thank you very much .

&lt; title &gt; Yang Lan : The generation that &apos;s remaking China &lt; / title &gt;
&lt; description &gt; Yang Lan , a journalist and entrepreneur who &apos;s been called &quot; the Oprah of China , &quot; offers insight into the next generation of young Chinese citizens -- urban , connected and alert to injustice . &lt; / description &gt;

&lt; url &gt; http : / / www.ted.com / talks / jeremy _ gilley _ one _ day _ of _ peace.html &lt; / url &gt;
I was basically concerned about what was going on in the world .
I couldn &apos;t understand the starvation , the destruction , the killing of innocent people .
Making sense of those things is a very difficult thing to do .
And when I was 12 , I became an actor .
I was bottom of the class . I haven &apos;t got any qualifications .
I was told I was dyslexic .
In fact , I have got qualifications .
I got a D in pottery , which was the one thing that I did get -- which was useful , obviously .
And so concern is where all of this comes from .
And then , being an actor , I was doing these different kinds of things , and I felt the content of the work that I was involved in really wasn &apos;t cutting it , that there surely had to be more .
And at that point , I read a book by Frank Barnaby , this wonderful nuclear physicist , and he said that media had a responsibility , that all sectors of society had a responsibility to try and progress things and move things forward .
And that fascinated me , because I &apos;d been messing around with a camera most of my life .
And then I thought , well maybe I could do something .
Maybe I could become a filmmaker .
Maybe I can use the form of film constructively to in some way make a difference .
Maybe there &apos;s a little change I can get involved in .
So I started thinking about peace , and I was obviously , as I said to you , very much moved by these images , trying to make sense of that .
Could I go and speak to older and wiser people who would tell me how they made sense of the things that are going on ?
Because it &apos;s obviously incredibly frightening .
But I realized that , having been messing around with structure as an actor , that a series of sound bites in itself wasn &apos;t enough , that there needed to be a mountain to climb , there needed to be a journey that I had to take .
And if I took that journey , no matter whether it failed or succeeded , it would be completely irrelevant .
The point was that I would have something to hook the questions of -- is humankind fundamentally evil ?
Is the destruction of the world inevitable ? Should I have children ?
Is that a responsible thing to do ? Etc . , etc .
So I was thinking about peace , and then I was thinking , well where &apos;s the starting point for peace ?
And that was when I had the idea .
There was no starting point for peace .
There was no day of global unity .
There was no day of intercultural cooperation .
There was no day when humanity came together , separate in all of those things and just shared it together -- that we &apos;re in this together , and that if we united and we interculturally cooperated , then that might be the key to humanity &apos;s survival .
That might shift the level of consciousness around the fundamental issues that humanity faces -- if we did it just for a day .
So obviously we didn &apos;t have any money .
I was living at my mom &apos;s place .
And we started writing letters to everybody .
You very quickly work out what is it that you &apos;ve got to do to fathom that out .
How do you create a day voted by every single head of state in the world to create the first ever Ceasefire Nonviolence Day , the 21st of September ?
And I wanted it to be the 21st of September because it was my granddad &apos;s favorite number .
He was a prisoner of war .
He saw the bomb go off at Nagasaki .
It poisoned his blood . He died when I was 11 .
So he was like my hero .
And the reason why 21 was the number is 700 men left , 23 came back , two died on the boat and 21 hit the ground .
And that &apos;s why we wanted it to be the 21st of September as the date of peace .
So we began this journey , and we launched it in 1999 .
And we wrote to heads of state , their ambassadors , Nobel Peace laureates , NGOs , faiths , various organizations -- literally wrote to everybody .
And very quickly , some letters started coming back .
And we started to build this case .
And I remember the first letter .
One of the first letters was from the Dalai Lama .
And of course we didn &apos;t have the money ; we were playing guitars and getting the money for the stamps that we were sending out all of &#91; this mail &#93; .
A letter came through from the Dalai Lama saying , &quot; This is an amazing thing . Come and see me .
I &apos;d love to talk to you about the first ever day of peace . &quot;
And we didn &apos;t have money for the flight .
And I rang Sir Bob Ayling , who was CEO of BA at the time , and said , &quot; Mate , we &apos;ve got this invitation .
Could you give me a flight ? Because we &apos;re going to go see him . &quot;
And of course , we went and saw him and it was amazing .
And then Dr. Oscar Arias came forward .
And actually , let me go back to that slide , because when we launched it in 1999 -- this idea to create the first ever day of ceasefire and non-violence -- we invited thousands of people .
Well not thousands -- hundreds of people , lots of people -- all the press , because we were going to try and create the first ever World Peace Day , a peace day .
And we invited everybody , and no press showed up .
There were 114 people there -- they were mostly my friends and family .
And that was kind of like the launch of this thing .
But it didn &apos;t matter because we were documenting , and that was the thing .
For me , it was really about the process .
It wasn &apos;t about the end result .
And that &apos;s the beautiful thing about the camera .
They used to say the pen is mightier than the sword . I think the camera is .
And just staying in the moment with it was a beautiful thing and really empowering actually .
So anyway , we began the journey .
And here you see people like Mary Robinson , I went to see in Geneva .
I &apos;m cutting my hair , it &apos;s getting short and long , because every time I saw Kofi Annan , I was so worried that he thought I was a hippie that I cut it , and that was kind of what was going on .
Yeah , I &apos;m not worried about it now .
So Mary Robinson , she said to me , &quot; Listen , this is an idea whose time has come . This must be created . &quot;
Kofi Annan said , &quot; This will be beneficial to my troops on the ground . &quot;
The OAU at the time , led by Salim Ahmed Salim , said , &quot; I must get the African countries involved . &quot;
Dr. Oscar Arias , Nobel Peace laureate , president now of Costa Rica , said , &quot; I &apos;ll do everything that I can . &quot;
So I went and saw Amr Moussa at the League of Arab States .
I met Mandela at the Arusha peace talks , and so on and so on and so on -- while I was building the case to prove whether this idea would make sense .
And then we were listening to the people . We were documenting everywhere .
76 countries in the last 12 years , I &apos;ve visited .
And I &apos;ve always spoken to women and children wherever I &apos;ve gone .
I &apos;ve recorded 44,000 young people .
I &apos;ve recorded about 900 hours of their thoughts .
I &apos;m really clear about how young people feel when you talk to them about this idea of having a starting point for their actions for a more peaceful world through their poetry , their art , their literature , their music , their sport , whatever it might be .
And we were listening to everybody .
And it was an incredibly thing , working with the U.N.
and working with NGOs and building this case .
I felt that I was presenting a case on behalf of the global community to try and create this day .
And the stronger the case and the more detailed it was , the better chance we had of creating this day .
And it was this stuff , this , where I actually was in the beginning kind of thinking no matter what happened , it didn &apos;t actually matter .
It didn &apos;t matter if it didn &apos;t create a day of peace .
The fact is that , if I tried and it didn &apos;t work , then I could make a statement about how unwilling the global community is to unite -- until , it was in Somalia , picking up that young girl .
And this young child who &apos;d taken about an inch and a half out of her leg with no antiseptic , and that young boy who was a child soldier , who told me he &apos;d killed people -- he was about 12 -- these things made me realize that this was not a film that I could just stop .
And that actually , at that moment something happened to me , which obviously made me go , &quot; I &apos;m going to document .
If this is the only film that I ever make , I &apos;m going to document until this becomes a reality . &quot;
Because we &apos;ve got to stop , we &apos;ve got to do something where we unite -- separate from all the politics and religion that , as a young person , is confusing me .
I don &apos;t know how to get involved in that process .
And then on the seventh of September , I was invited to New York .
The Costa Rican government and the British government had put forward to the United Nations General Assembly , with 54 co-sponsors , the idea of the first ever Ceasefire Nonviolence Day , the 21st of September , as a fixed calendar date , and it was unanimously adopted by every head of state in the world .
Yeah , but there were hundreds of individuals , obviously , who made that a reality .
And thank you to all of them .
That was an incredible moment .
I was at the top of the General Assembly just looking down into it and seeing it happen .
And as I mentioned , when it started , we were at the Globe , and there was no press .
And now I was thinking , &quot; Well , the press it really going to hear this story . &quot;
And suddenly , we started to institutionalize this day .
Kofi Annan invited me on the morning of September the 11th to do a press conference .
And it was 8 : 00 AM when I stood there .
And I was waiting for him to come down , and I knew that he was on his way .
And obviously he never came down . The statement was never made .
The world was never told there was a day of global ceasefire and nonviolence .
And it was obviously a tragic moment for the thousands of people who lost their lives , there and then subsequently all over the world .
It never happened .
And I remember thinking , &quot; This is exactly why , actually , we have to work even harder .
And we have to make this day work .
It &apos;s been created ; nobody knows .
But we have to continue this journey , and we have to tell people , and we have to prove it can work . &quot;
And I left New York freaked , but actually empowered .
And I felt inspired by the possibilities that if it did , then maybe we wouldn &apos;t see things like that .
I remember putting that film out and going to cynics .
I was showing the film , and I remember being in Israel and getting it absolutely slaughtered by some guys having watched the film -- that it &apos;s just a day of peace , it doesn &apos;t mean anything .
It &apos;s not going to work ; you &apos;re not going to stop the fighting in Afghanistan ; the Taliban won &apos;t listen , etc . , etc .
It &apos;s just symbolism .
And that was even worse than actually what had just happened in many ways , because it couldn &apos;t not work .
I &apos;d spoken in Somalia , Burundi , Gaza , the West Bank , India , Sri Lanka , Congo , wherever it was , and they &apos;d all tell me , &quot; If you can create a window of opportunity , we can move aid , we can vaccinate children .
Children can lead their projects .
They can unite . They can come together . If people would stop , lives will be saved . &quot;
That &apos;s what I &apos;d heard .
And I &apos;d heard that from the people who really understood what conflict was about .
And so I went back to the United Nations .
I decided that I &apos;d continue filming and make another movie .
And I went back to the U.N. for another couple of years .
We started moving around the corridors of the U.N. system , governments and NGOs , trying desperately to find somebody to come forward and have a go at it , see if we could make it possible .
And after lots and lots of meetings obviously , I &apos;m delighted that this man , Ahmad Fawzi , one of my heroes and mentors really , he managed to get UNICEF involved .
And UNICEF , God bless them , they said , &quot; Okay , we &apos;ll have a go . &quot;
And then UNAMA became involved in Afghanistan .
It was historical . Could it work in Afghanistan with UNAMA and WHO and civil society , etc . , etc . , etc . ?
And I was getting it all on film and I was recording it , and I was thinking , &quot; This is it . This is the possibility of it maybe working .
But even if it doesn &apos;t , at least the door is open and there &apos;s a chance . &quot;
And so I went back to London , and I went and saw this chap , Jude Law .
And I saw him because he was an actor , I was an actor , I had a connection to him , because we needed to get to the press , we needed this attraction , we needed the media to be involved .
Because if we start pumping it up a bit maybe more people would listen and there &apos;d be more -- when we got into certain areas , maybe there would be more people interested .
And maybe we &apos;d be helped financially a little bit more , which had been desperately difficult .
I won &apos;t go into that .
So Jude said , &quot; Okay , I &apos;ll do some statements for you . &quot;
While I was filming these statements , he said to me , &quot; Where are you going next ? &quot;
I said , &quot; I &apos;m going to go to Afghanistan . &quot; He said , &quot; Really ? &quot;
And I could sort of see a little look in his eye of interest .
So I said to him , &quot; Do you want to come with me ?
It &apos;d be really interesting if you came .
It would help and bring attention .
And that attention would help leverage the situation , as well as all of the other sides of it . &quot;
I think there &apos;s a number of pillars to success .
One is you &apos;ve got to have a great idea .
The other is you &apos;ve got to have a constituency , you &apos;ve got to have finance , and you &apos;ve got to be able to raise awareness .
And actually I could never raise awareness by myself , no matter what I &apos;d achieved .
So these guys were absolutely crucial .
So he said yes , and we found ourselves in Afghanistan .
It was a really incredible thing that when we landed there , I was talking to various people , and they were saying to me , &quot; You &apos;ve got to get everybody involved here .
You can &apos;t just expect it to work . You have to get out and work . &quot;
And we did , and we traveled around , and we spoke to elders , we spoke to doctors , we spoke to nurses , we held press conferences , we went out with soldiers , we sat down with ISAF , we sat down with NATO , we sat down with the U.K. government .
I mean , we basically sat down with everybody -- in and out of schools with ministers of education , holding these press conferences , which of course , now were loaded with press , everybody was there .
There was an interest in what was going on .
This amazing woman , Fatima Gailani , was absolutely instrumental in what went on as she was the spokesperson for the resistance against the Russians .
And her Afghan network was just absolutely everywhere .
And she was really crucial in getting the message in .
And then we went home . We &apos;d sort of done it .
We had to wait now and see what happened .
And I got home , and I remember one of the team bringing in a letter to me from the Taliban .
And that letter basically said , &quot; We &apos;ll observe this day .
We will observe this day .
We see it as a window of opportunity .
And we will not engage . We &apos;re not going to engage . &quot;
And that meant that humanitarian workers wouldn &apos;t be kidnapped or killed .
And then suddenly , I obviously knew at this point , there was a chance .
And days later , 1.6 million children were vaccinated against polio as a consequence of everybody stopping .
And like the General Assembly , obviously the most wonderful , wonderful moment .
And so then we wrapped the film up and we put it together because we had to go back .
We put it into Dari and Pashto . We put it in the local dialects .
We went back to Afghanistan , because the next year was coming , and we wanted to support .
But more importantly , we wanted to go back , because these people in Afghanistan were the heroes .
They were the people who believed in peace and the possibilities of it , etc . , etc . -- and they made it real .
And we wanted to go back and show them the film and say , &quot; Look , you guys made this possible . And thank you very much . &quot;
And we gave the film over .
Obviously it was shown , and it was amazing .
And then that year , that year , 2008 , this ISAF statement from Kabul , Afghanistan , September 17th : &quot; General Stanley McChrystal , commander of international security assistance forces in Afghanistan , announced today ISAF will not conduct offensive military operations on the 21st of September . &quot;
They were saying they would stop .
And then there was this other statement that came out from the U.N. Department of Security and Safety saying that , in Afghanistan , because of this work , the violence was down by 70 percent .
70 percent reduction in violence on this day at least .
And that completely blew my mind almost more than anything .
And I remember being stuck in New York , this time because of the volcano , which was obviously much less harmful .
And I was there thinking about what was going on .
And I kept thinking about this 70 percent .
70 percent reduction in violence -- in what everyone said was completely impossible and you couldn &apos;t do .
And that made me think that , if we can get 70 percent in Afghanistan , then surely we can get 70 percent reduction everywhere .
We have to go for a global truce .
We have to utilize this day of ceasefire and nonviolence and go for a global truce , go for the largest recorded cessation of hostilities , both domestically and internationally , ever recorded .
That &apos;s exactly what we must do .
And on the 21st of September this year , we &apos;re going to launch that campaign at the O2 Arena to go for that process , to try and create the largest recorded cessation of hostilities .
And we will utilize all kinds of things -- have a dance and social media and visiting on Facebook and visit the website , sign the petition .
And it &apos;s in the six official languages of the United Nations .
And we &apos;ll globally link with government , inter-government , non-government , education , unions , sports .
And you can see the education box there .
We &apos;ve got resources at the moment in 174 countries trying to get young people to be the driving force behind the vision of that global truce .
And obviously the life-saving is increased , the concepts help .
Linking up with the Olympics -- I went and saw Seb Coe . I said , &quot; London 2012 is about truce .
Ultimately , that &apos;s what it &apos;s about . &quot;
Why don &apos;t we all team up ? Why don &apos;t we bring truce to life ?
Why don &apos;t you support the process of the largest ever global truce ?
We &apos;ll make a new film about this process .
We &apos;ll utilize sport and football .
On the Day of Peace , there &apos;s thousands of football matches all played , from the favelas of Brazil to wherever it might be .
So , utilizing all of these ways to inspire individual action .
And ultimately , we have to try that .
We have to work together .
And when I stand here in front of all of you , and the people who will watch these things , I &apos;m excited , on behalf of everybody I &apos;ve met , that there is a possibility that our world could unite , that we could come together as one , that we could lift the level of consciousness around the fundamental issues , brought about by individuals .
I was with Brahimi , Ambassador Brahimi .
I think he &apos;s one of the most incredible men in relation to international politics -- in Afghanistan , in Iraq .
He &apos;s an amazing man .
And I sat with him a few weeks ago .
And I said to him , &quot; Mr. Brahimi , is this nuts , going for a global truce ?
Is this possible ? Is it really possible that we could do this ? &quot;
He said , &quot; It &apos;s absolutely possible . &quot;
I said , &quot; What would you do ?
Would you go to governments and lobby and use the system ? &quot;
He said , &quot; No , I &apos;d talk to the individuals . &quot;
It &apos;s all about the individuals .
It &apos;s all about you and me .
It &apos;s all about partnerships .
It &apos;s about your constituencies ; it &apos;s about your businesses .
Because together , by working together , I seriously think we can start to change things .
And there &apos;s a wonderful man sitting in this audience , and I don &apos;t know where he is , who said to me a few days ago -- because I did a little rehearsal -- and he said , &quot; I &apos;ve been thinking about this day and imagining it as a square with 365 squares , and one of them is white . &quot;
And it then made me think about a glass of water , which is clear .
If you put one drop , one drop of something , in that water , it &apos;ll change it forever .
By working together , we can create peace one day .
Thank you TED . Thank you .
Thank you .
Thanks a lot .
Thank you very much . Thank you .

&lt; url &gt; http : / / www.ted.com / talks / terry _ moore _ how _ to _ tie _ your _ shoes.html &lt; / url &gt;
I &apos;m used to thinking of the TED audience as a wonderful collection of some of the most effective , intelligent , intellectual , savvy , worldly and innovative people in the world .
And I think that &apos;s true .
However , I also have reason to believe that many , if not most , of you are actually tying your shoes incorrectly .
Now I know that seems ludicrous .
I know that seems ludicrous .
And believe me , I lived the same sad life until about three years ago .
And what happened to me was I bought , what was for me , a very expensive pair of shoes .
But those shoes came with round nylon laces , and I couldn &apos;t keep them tied .
So I went back to the store and said to the owner , &quot; I love the shoes , but I hate the laces . &quot;
He took a look and said , &quot; Oh , you &apos;re tying them wrong . &quot;
Now up until that moment , I would have thought that , by age 50 , one of the life skills that I had really nailed was tying my shoes .
But not so -- let me demonstrate .
This is the way that most of us were taught to tie our shoes .
Now as it turns out -- thank you .
Wait , there &apos;s more .
As it turns out , there &apos;s a strong form and a weak form of this knot , and we were taught to tie the weak form .
And here &apos;s how to tell .
If you pull the strands at the base of the knot , you will see that the bow will orient itself down the long axis of the shoe .
That &apos;s the weak form of the knot .
But not to worry .
If we start over and simply go the other direction around the bow , we get this , the strong form of the knot .
And if you pull the cords under the knot , you will see that the bow orients itself along the transverse axis of the shoe .
This is a stronger knot . It will come untied less often .
It will let you down less , and not only that , it looks better .
We &apos;re going to do this one more time .
Start as usual , go the other way around the loop .
This is a little hard for children , but I think you can handle it .
Pull the knot .
There it is : the strong form of the shoe knot .
Now , in keeping with today &apos;s theme , I &apos;d like to point out -- and something you already know -- that sometimes a small advantage someplace in life can yield tremendous results someplace else .
Live long and prosper .

&lt; url &gt; http : / / www.ted.com / talks / lucianne _ walkowicz _ finding _ planets _ around _ other _ stars.html &lt; / url &gt;
Planetary systems outside our own are like distant cities whose lights we can see twinkling , but whose streets we can &apos;t walk .
By studying those twinkling lights though , we can learn about how stars and planets interact to form their own ecosystem and make habitats that are amenable to life .
In this image of the Tokyo skyline , I &apos;ve hidden data from the newest planet-hunting space telescope on the block , the Kepler Mission .
Can you see it ?
There we go .
This is just a tiny part of the sky the Kepler stares at , where it searches for planets by measuring the light from over 150,000 stars , all at once , every half hour , and very precisely .
And what we &apos;re looking for is the tiny dimming of light that is caused by a planet passing in front of one of these stars and blocking some of that starlight from getting to us .
In just over two years of operations , we &apos;ve found over 1,200 potential new planetary systems around other stars .
To give you some perspective , in the previous two decades of searching , we had only known about 400 prior to Kepler .
When we see these little dips in the light , we can determine a number of things .
For one thing , we can determine that there &apos;s a planet there , but also how big that planet is and how far it is away from its parent star .
That distance is really important because it tells us how much light the planet receives overall .
And that distance and knowing that amount of light is important because it &apos;s a little like you or I sitting around a campfire : You want to be close enough to the campfire so that you &apos;re warm , but not so close that you &apos;re too toasty and you get burned .
However , there &apos;s more to know about your parent star than just how much light you receive overall .
And I &apos;ll tell you why .
This is our star . This is our Sun .
It &apos;s shown here in visible light .
That &apos;s the light that you can see with your own human eyes .
You &apos;ll notice that it looks pretty much like the iconic yellow ball -- that Sun that we all draw when we &apos;re children .
But you &apos;ll notice something else , and that &apos;s that the face of the Sun has freckles .
These freckles are called sunspots , and they are just one of the manifestations of the Sun &apos;s magnetic field .
They also cause the light from the star to vary .
And we can measure this very , very precisely with Kepler and trace their effects .
However , these are just the tip of the iceberg .
If we had UV eyes or X-ray eyes , we would really see the dynamic and dramatic effects of our Sun &apos;s magnetic activity -- the kind of thing that happens on other stars as well .
Just think , even when it &apos;s cloudy outside , these kind of events are happening in the sky above you all the time .
So when we want to learn whether a planet is habitable , whether it might be amenable to life , we want to know not only how much total light it receives and how warm it is , but we want to know about its space weather -- this high-energy radiation , the UV and the X-rays that are created by its star and that bathe it in this bath of high-energy radiation .
And so , we can &apos;t really look at planets around other stars in the same kind of detail that we can look at planets in our own solar system .
I &apos;m showing here Venus , Earth and Mars -- three planets in our own solar system that are roughly the same size , but only one of which is really a good place to live .
But what we can do in the meantime is measure the light from our stars and learn about this relationship between the planets and their parent stars to suss out clues about which planets might be good places to look for life in the universe .
Kepler won &apos;t find a planet around every single star it looks at .
But really , every measurement it makes is precious , because it &apos;s teaching us about the relationship between stars and planets , and how it &apos;s really the starlight that sets the stage for the formation of life in the universe .
While it &apos;s Kepler the telescope , the instrument that stares , it &apos;s we , life , who are searching .
Thank you .

&lt; description &gt; How do we find planets -- even habitable planets -- around other stars ? By looking for tiny dimming as a planet passes in front of its sun , Fellow Lucianne Walkowicz and the Kepler mission have found some 1,200 potential new planetary systems . With new techniques , they may even find ones with the right conditions for life . &lt; / description &gt;

&lt; url &gt; http : / / www.ted.com / talks / dave _ meslin _ the _ antidote _ to _ apathy.html &lt; / url &gt;
How often do we hear that people just don &apos;t care ?
How many times have you been told that real , substantial change isn &apos;t possible because most people are too selfish , too stupid or too lazy to try to make a difference in their community ?
I propose to you today that apathy as we think we know it doesn &apos;t actually exist , but rather , that people do care , but that we live in a world that actively discourages engagement by constantly putting obstacles and barriers in our way .
And I &apos;ll give you some examples of what I mean .
Let &apos;s start with city hall .
You ever see one of these before ?
This is a newspaper ad .
It &apos;s a notice of a zoning application change for a new office building so the neighborhood knows what &apos;s happening .
As you can see , it &apos;s impossible to read .
You need to get halfway down to even find out which address they &apos;re talking about , and then farther down , in tiny 10-point font , to find out how to actually get involved .
Imagine if the private sector advertised in the same way -- if Nike wanted to sell a pair of shoes and put an ad in the paper like that .
Now that would never happen .
You &apos;ll never see an ad like that because Nike actually wants you to buy their shoes .
Whereas the city of Toronto clearly doesn &apos;t want you involved with the planning process , otherwise their ads would look something like this -- with all the information basically laid out clearly .
As long as the city &apos;s putting out notices like this to try to get people engaged , then of course people aren &apos;t going to be engaged .
But that &apos;s not apathy ; that &apos;s intentional exclusion .
Public space .
The manner in which we mistreat our public spaces is a huge obstacle towards any type of progressive political change because we &apos;ve essentially put a price tag on freedom of expression .
Whoever has the most money gets the loudest voice , dominating the visual and mental environment .
The problem with this model is that there are some amazing messages that need to be said that aren &apos;t profitable to say .
So you &apos;re never going to see them on a billboard .
The media plays an important role in developing our relationship with political change , mainly by ignoring politics and focusing on celebrities and scandals , but even when they do talk about important political issues , they do it in a way that I feel discourages engagement .
And I &apos;ll give you an example : the Now magazine from last week -- progressive , downtown weekly in Toronto .
This is the cover story .
It &apos;s an article about a theater performance , and it starts with basic information about where it is , in case you actually want to go and see it after you &apos;ve read the article -- where , the time , the website .
Same with this -- it &apos;s a movie review , an art review , a book review -- where the reading is in case you want to go .
A restaurant -- you might not want to just read about it , maybe you want to go to the restaurant .
So they tell you where it is , what the prices are , the address , the phone number , etc .
Then you get to their political articles .
Here &apos;s a great article about an important election race that &apos;s happening .
It talks about the candidates -- written very well -- but no information , no follow-up , no websites for the campaigns , no information about when the debates are , where the campaign offices are .
Here &apos;s another good article about a new campaign opposing privatization of transit without any contact information for the campaign .
The message seems to be that the readers are most likely to want to eat , maybe read a book , maybe see a movie , but not be engaged in their community .
And you might think this is a small thing , but I think it &apos;s important because it sets a tone and it reinforces the dangerous idea that politics is a spectator sport .
Heroes : How do we view leadership ?
Look at these 10 movies . What do they have in common ?
Anyone ?
They all have heroes who were chosen .
Someone came up to them and said , &quot; You &apos;re the chosen one .
There &apos;s a prophesy . You have to save the world . &quot;
And then someone goes off and saves the world because they &apos;ve been told to , with a few people tagging along .
This helps me understand why a lot of people have trouble seeing themselves as leaders because it sends all the wrong messages about what leadership is about .
A heroic effort is a collective effort , number one .
Number two , it &apos;s imperfect ; it &apos;s not very glamorous , and it doesn &apos;t suddenly start and suddenly end .
It &apos;s an ongoing process your whole life .
But most importantly , it &apos;s voluntary .
It &apos;s voluntary .
As long as we &apos;re teaching our kids that heroism starts when someone scratches a mark on your forehead , or someone tells you that you &apos;re part of a prophecy , they &apos;re missing the most important characteristic of leadership , which is that it comes from within .
It &apos;s about following your own dreams -- uninvited , uninvited -- and then working with others to make those dreams come true .
Political parties : oh boy .
Political parties could and should be one of the basic entry points for people to get engaged in politics .
Instead , they &apos;ve become , sadly , uninspiring and uncreative organizations that rely so heavily on market research and polling and focus groups that they end up all saying the same thing , pretty much regurgitating back to us what we already want to hear at the expense of putting forward bold and creative ideas .
And people can smell that , and it feeds cynicism .
Charitable status : Groups who have charitable status in Canada aren &apos;t allowed to do advocacy .
This is a huge problem and a huge obstacle to change because it means that some of the most passionate and informed voices are completely silenced , especially during election time .
Which leads us to the last one , which is our elections .
As you may have noticed , our elections in Canada are a complete joke .
We use out-of-date systems that are unfair and create random results .
Canada &apos;s currently led by a party that most Canadians didn &apos;t actually want .
How can we honestly and genuinely encourage more people to vote when votes don &apos;t count in Canada ?
You add all this up together and of course people are apathetic .
It &apos;s like trying to run into a brick wall .
Now I &apos;m not trying to be negative by throwing all these obstacles out and explaining what &apos;s in our way .
Quite the opposite : I actually think people are amazing and smart and that they do care .
But that , as I said , we live in this environment where all these obstacles are being put in our way .
As long as we believe that people , our own neighbors , are selfish , stupid or lazy , then there &apos;s no hope .
But we can change all those things I mentioned .
We can open up city hall .
We can reform our electoral systems .
We can democratize our public spaces .
My main message is , if we can redefine apathy , not as some kind of internal syndrome , but as a complex web of cultural barriers that reinforces disengagement , and if we can clearly define , we can clearly identify , what those obstacles are , and then if we can work together collectively to dismantle those obstacles , then anything is possible .
Thank you .

What you &apos;re doing , right now , at this very moment , is killing you .
More than cars or the Internet or even that little mobile device we keep talking about , the technology you &apos;re using the most almost every day is this , your tush .
Nowadays people are sitting 9.3 hours a day , which is more than we &apos;re sleeping , at 7.7 hours .
Sitting is so incredibly prevalent , we don &apos;t even question how much we &apos;re doing it , and because everyone else is doing it , it doesn &apos;t even occur to us that it &apos;s not okay .
In that way , sitting has become the smoking of our generation .
Of course there &apos;s health consequences to this , scary ones , besides the waist .
Things like breast cancer and colon cancer are directly tied to our lack of physical &#91; activity &#93; , Ten percent in fact , on both of those .
Six percent for heart disease , seven percent for type 2 diabetes , which is what my father died of .
Now , any of those stats should convince each of us to get off our duff more , but if you &apos;re anything like me , it won &apos;t .
What did get me moving was a social interaction .
Someone invited me to a meeting , but couldn &apos;t manage to fit me in to a regular sort of conference room meeting , and said , &quot; I have to walk my dogs tomorrow . Could you come then ? &quot;
It seemed kind of odd to do , and actually , that first meeting , I remember thinking , &quot; I have to be the one to ask the next question , &quot; because I knew I was going to huff and puff during this conversation .
And yet , I &apos;ve taken that idea and made it my own .
So instead of going to coffee meetings or fluorescent-lit conference room meetings , I ask people to go on a walking meeting , to the tune of 20 to 30 miles a week .
It &apos;s changed my life .
But before that , what actually happened was , I used to think about it as , you could take care of your health , or you could take care of obligations , and one always came at the cost of the other .
So now , several hundred of these walking meetings later , I &apos;ve learned a few things .
First , there &apos;s this amazing thing about actually getting out of the box that leads to out-of-the-box thinking .
Whether it &apos;s nature or the exercise itself , it certainly works .
And second , and probably the more reflective one , is just about how much each of us can hold problems in opposition when they &apos;re really not that way .
And if we &apos;re going to solve problems and look at the world really differently , whether it &apos;s in governance or business or environmental issues , job creation , maybe we can think about how to reframe those problems as having both things be true .
Because it was when that happened with this walk-and-talk idea that things became doable and sustainable and viable .
So I started this talk talking about the tush , so I &apos;ll end with the bottom line , which is , walk and talk .
Walk the talk .
You &apos;ll be surprised at how fresh air drives fresh thinking , and in the way that you do , you &apos;ll bring into your life an entirely new set of ideas .
Thank you .

&lt; url &gt; http : / / www.ted.com / talks / graham _ hill _ weekday _ vegetarian.html &lt; / url &gt;
About a year ago , I asked myself a question : &quot; Knowing what I know , why am I not a vegetarian ? &quot;
After all , I &apos;m one of the green guys : I grew up with hippie parents in a log cabin .
I started a site called TreeHugger -- I care about this stuff .
I knew that eating a mere hamburger a day can increase my risk of dying by a third .
Cruelty : I knew that the 10 billion animals we raise each year for meat are raised in factory farm conditions that we , hypocritically , wouldn &apos;t even consider for our own cats , dogs and other pets .
Environmentally , meat , amazingly , causes more emissions than all of transportation combined : cars , trains , planes , buses , boats , all of it .
And beef production uses 100 times the water that most vegetables do .
I also knew that I &apos;m not alone .
We as a society are eating twice as much meat as we did in the 50s .
So what was once the special little side treat now is the main , much more regular .
So really , any of these angles should have been enough to convince me to go vegetarian .
Yet , there I was -- chk , chk , chk -- tucking into a big old steak .
So why was I stalling ?
I realized that what I was being pitched was a binary solution .
It was either you &apos;re a meat eater or you &apos;re a vegetarian , and I guess I just wasn &apos;t quite ready .
Imagine your last hamburger .
So my common sense , my good intentions , were in conflict with my taste buds .
And I &apos;d commit to doing it later , and not surprisingly , later never came .
Sound familiar ?
So I wondered , might there be a third solution ?
And I thought about it , and I came up with one .
I &apos;ve been doing it for the last year , and it &apos;s great .
It &apos;s called weekday veg .
The name says it all : Nothing with a face Monday through Friday .
On the weekend , your choice .
Simple .
If you want to take it to the next level , remember , the major culprits in terms of environmental damage and health are red and processed meats .
So you want to swap those out with some good , sustainably harvested fish .
It &apos;s structured , so it ends up being simple to remember , and it &apos;s okay to break it here and there .
After all , cutting five days a week is cutting 70 percent of your meat intake .
The program has been great , weekday veg .
My footprint &apos;s smaller , I &apos;m lessening pollution , I feel better about the animals , I &apos;m even saving money .
Best of all , I &apos;m healthier , I know that I &apos;m going to live longer , and I &apos;ve even lost a little weight .
So , please ask yourselves , for your health , for your pocketbook , for the environment , for the animals : What &apos;s stopping you from giving weekday veg a shot ?
After all , if all of us ate half as much meat , it would be like half of us were vegetarians .
Thank you .

&lt; url &gt; http : / / www.ted.com / talks / lisa _ kristine _ glimpses _ of _ modern _ day _ slavery.html &lt; / url &gt;
I &apos;m 150 feet down an illegal mine shaft in Ghana .
The air is thick with heat and dust , and it &apos;s hard to breathe .
I can feel the brush of sweaty bodies passing me in the darkness , but I can &apos;t see much else .
I hear voices talking , but mostly the shaft is this cacophony of men coughing , and stone being broken with primitive tools .
Like the others , I wear a flickering , cheap flashlight tied to my head with this elastic , tattered band , and I can barely make out the slick tree limbs holding up the walls of the three-foot square hole dropping hundreds of feet into the earth .
When my hand slips , I suddenly remember a miner I had met days before who had lost his grip and fell countless feet down that shaft .
As I stand talking to you today , these men are still deep in that hole , risking their lives without payment or compensation , and often dying .
I got to climb out of that hole , and I got to go home , but they likely never will , because they &apos;re trapped in slavery .
For the last 28 years , I &apos;ve been documenting indigenous cultures in more than 70 countries on six continents , and in 2009 I had the great honor of being the sole exhibitor at the Vancouver Peace Summit .
Amongst all the astonishing people I met there , I met a supporter of Free the Slaves , an NGO dedicated to eradicating modern day slavery .
We started talking about slavery , and really , I started learning about slavery , for I had certainly known it existed in the world , but not to such a degree .
After we finished talking , I felt so horrible and honestly ashamed at my own lack of knowledge of this atrocity in my own lifetime , and I thought , if I don &apos;t know , how many other people don &apos;t know ?
It started burning a hole in my stomach , so within weeks , I flew down to Los Angeles to meet with the director of Free the Slaves and offer them my help .
Thus began my journey into modern day slavery .
Oddly , I had been to many of these places before .
Some I even considered like my second home .
But this time , I would see the skeletons hidden in the closet .
A conservative estimate tells us there are more than 27 million people enslaved in the world today .
That &apos;s double the amount of people taken from Africa during the entire trans-Atlantic slave trade .
A hundred and fifty years ago , an agricultural slave cost about three times the annual salary of an American worker .
That equates to about $ 50,000 in today &apos;s money .
Yet today , entire families can be enslaved for generations over a debt as small as $ 18 .
Astonishingly , slavery generates profits of more than $ 13 billion worldwide each year .
Many have been tricked by false promises of a good education , a better job , only to find that they &apos;re forced to work without pay under the threat of violence , and they cannot walk away .
Today &apos;s slavery is about commerce , so the goods that enslaved people produce have value , but the people producing them are disposable .
Slavery exists everywhere , nearly , in the world , and yet it is illegal everywhere in the world .
In India and Nepal , I was introduced to the brick kilns .
This strange and awesome sight was like walking into ancient Egypt or Dante &apos;s Inferno .
Enveloped in temperatures of 130 degrees , men , women , children , entire families in fact , were cloaked in a heavy blanket of dust , while mechanically stacking bricks on their head , up to 18 at a time , and carrying them from the scorching kilns to trucks hundreds of yards away .
Deadened by monotony and exhaustion , they work silently , doing this task over and over for 16 or 17 hours a day .
There were no breaks for food , no water breaks , and the severe dehydration made urinating pretty much inconsequential .
So pervasive was the heat and the dust that my camera became too hot to even touch and ceased working .
Every 20 minutes , I &apos;d have to run back to our cruiser to clean out my gear and run it under an air conditioner to revive it , and as I sat there , I thought , my camera is getting far better treatment than these people .
Back in the kilns , I wanted to cry , but the abolitionist next to me quickly grabbed me and he said , &quot; Lisa , don &apos;t do that . Just don &apos;t do that here . &quot;
And he very clearly explained to me that emotional displays are very dangerous in a place like this , not just for me , but for them .
I couldn &apos;t offer them any direct help .
I couldn &apos;t give them money , nothing .
I wasn &apos;t a citizen of that country .
I could get them in a worse situation than they were already in .
I &apos;d have to rely on Free the Slaves to work within the system for their liberation , and I trusted that they would .
As for me , I &apos;d have to wait until I got home to really feel my heartbreak .
In the Himalayas , I found children carrying stone for miles down mountainous terrain to trucks waiting at roads below .
The big sheets of slate were heavier than the children carrying them , and the kids hoisted them from their heads using these handmade harnesses of sticks and rope and torn cloth .
It &apos;s difficult to witness something so overwhelming .
How can we affect something so insidious , yet so pervasive ?
Some don &apos;t even know they &apos;re enslaved , people working 16 , 17 hours a day without any pay , because this has been the case all their lives .
They have nothing to compare it to .
When these villagers claimed their freedom , the slaveholders burned down all of their houses .
I mean , these people had nothing , and they were so petrified , they wanted to give up , but the woman in the center rallied for them to persevere , and abolitionists on the ground helped them get a quarry lease of their own , so that now they do the same back-breaking work , but they do it for themselves , and they get paid for it , and they do it in freedom .
Sex trafficking is what we often think of when we hear the word slavery , and because of this worldwide awareness , I was warned that it would be difficult for me to work safely within this particular industry .
In Kathmandu , I was escorted by women who had previously been sex slaves themselves .
They ushered me down a narrow set of stairs that led to this dirty , dimly fluorescent lit basement .
This wasn &apos;t a brothel , per se .
It was more like a restaurant .
Cabin restaurants , as they &apos;re known in the trade , are venues for forced prostitution .
Each has small , private rooms , where the slaves , women , along with young girls and boys , some as young as seven years old , are forced to entertain the clients , encouraging them to buy more food and alcohol .
Each cubicle is dark and dingy , identified with a painted number on the wall , and partitioned by plywood and a curtain .
The workers here often endure tragic sexual abuse at the hands of their customers .
Standing in the near darkness , I remember feeling this quick , hot fear , and in that instant , I could only imagine what it must be like to be trapped in that hell .
I had only one way out : the stairs from where I &apos;d come in .
There were no back doors .
There were no windows large enough to climb through .
These people have no escape at all , and as we take in such a difficult subject , it &apos;s important to note that slavery , including sex trafficking , occurs in our own backyard as well .
Tens of hundreds of people are enslaved in agriculture , in restaurants , in domestic servitude , and the list can go on .
Recently , the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 American children are sold into sex slavery every year .
It &apos;s all around us . We just don &apos;t see it .
The textile industry is another one we often think of when we hear about slave labor .
I visited villages in India where entire families were enslaved in the silk trade .
This is a family portrait .
The dyed black hands are the father , while the blue and red hands are his sons .
They mix dye in these big barrels , and they submerge the silk into the liquid up to their elbows , but the dye is toxic .
My interpreter told me their stories .
&quot; We have no freedom , &quot; they said .
&quot; We hope still , though , that we could leave this house someday and go someplace else where we actually get paid for our dyeing . &quot;
It &apos;s estimated that more than 4,000 children are enslaved on Lake Volta , the largest man-made lake in the world .
When we first arrived , I went to have a quick look .
I saw what seemed to be a family fishing on a boat , two older brothers , some younger kids , makes sense right ?
Wrong . They were all enslaved .
Children are taken from their families and trafficked and vanished , and they &apos;re forced to work endless hours on these boats on the lake , even though they do not know how to swim .
This young child is eight years old .
He was trembling when our boat approached , frightened it would run over his tiny canoe .
He was petrified he would be knocked in the water .
The skeletal tree limbs submerged in Lake Volta often catch the fishing nets , and weary , frightened children are thrown into the water to untether the lines .
Many of them drown .
For as long as he can recall , he &apos;s been forced to work on the lake .
Terrified of his master , he will not run away , and since he &apos;s been treated with cruelty all his life , he passes that down to the younger slaves that he manages .
I met these boys at five in the morning , when they were hauling in the last of their nets , but they had been working since 1 a.m.
in the cold , windy night .
And it &apos;s important to note that these nets weigh more than a thousand pounds when they &apos;re full of fish .
I want to introduce you to Kofi .
Kofi was rescued from a fishing village .
I met him at a shelter where Free the Slaves rehabilitates victims of slavery .
Here he &apos;s seen taking a bath at the well , pouring big buckets of water over his head , and the wonderful news is , as you and I are sitting here talking today , Kofi has been reunited with his family , and what &apos;s even better , his family has been given tools to make a living and to keep their children safe .
Kofi is the embodiment of possibility .
Who will he become because someone took a stand and made a difference in his life ?
Driving down a road in Ghana with partners of Free the Slaves , a fellow abolitionist on a moped suddenly sped up to our cruiser and tapped on the window .
He told us to follow him down a dirt road into the jungle .
At the end of the road , he urged us out of the car , and told the driver to quickly leave .
Then he pointed toward this barely visible footpath , and said , &quot; This is the path , this is the path . Go . &quot;
As we started down the path , we pushed aside the vines blocking the way , and after about an hour of walking in , found that the trail had become flooded by recent rains , so I hoisted the photo gear above my head as we descended into these waters up to my chest .
After another two hours of hiking , the winding trail abruptly ended at a clearing , and before us was a mass of holes that could fit into the size of a football field , and all of them were full of enslaved people laboring .
Many women had children strapped to their backs while they were panning for gold , wading in water poisoned by mercury .
Mercury is used in the extraction process .
These miners are enslaved in a mine shaft in another part of Ghana .
When they came out of the shaft , they were soaking wet from their own sweat .
I remember looking into their tired , bloodshot eyes , for many of them had been underground for 72 hours .
The shafts are up to 300 feet deep , and they carry out heavy bags of stone that later will be transported to another area , where the stone will be pounded so that they can extract the gold .
At first glance , the pounding site seems full of powerful men , but when we look closer , we see some less fortunate working on the fringes , and children too .
All of them are victim to injury , illness and violence .
In fact , it &apos;s very likely that this muscular person will end up like this one here , racked with tuberculosis and mercury poisoning in just a few years .
This is Manuru . When his father died , his uncle trafficked him to work with him in the mines .
When his uncle died , Manuru inherited his uncle &apos;s debt , which further forced him into being enslaved in the mines .
When I met him , he had been working in the mines for 14 years , and the leg injury that you see here is actually from a mining accident , one so severe doctors say his leg should be amputated .
On top of that , Manuru has tuberculosis , yet he &apos;s still forced to work day in and day out in that mine shaft .
Even still , he has a dream that he will become free and become educated with the help of local activists like Free the Slaves , and it &apos;s this sort of determination , in the face of unimaginable odds , that fills me with complete awe .
I want to shine a light on slavery .
When I was working in the field , I brought lots of candles with me , and with the help of my interpreter , I imparted to the people I was photographing that I wanted to illuminate their stories and their plight , so when it was safe for them , and safe for me , I made these images .
They knew their image would be seen by you out in the world .
I wanted them to know that we will be bearing witness to them , and that we will do whatever we can to help make a difference in their lives .
I truly believe , if we can see one another as fellow human beings , then it becomes very difficult to tolerate atrocities like slavery .
These images are not of issues . They are of people , real people , like you and me , all deserving of the same rights , dignity and respect in their lives .
There is not a day that goes by that I don &apos;t think of these many beautiful , mistreated people I &apos;ve had the tremendous honor of meeting .
I hope that these images awaken a force in those who view them , people like you , and I hope that force will ignite a fire , and that fire will shine a light on slavery , for without that light , the beast of bondage can continue to live in the shadows .
Thank you very much .

&lt; url &gt; http : / / www.ted.com / talks / kirk _ citron _ and _ now _ the _ real _ news.html &lt; / url &gt;
We are drowning in news .
Reuters alone puts out three and a half million news stories a year .
That &apos;s just one source .
My question is : How many of those stories are actually going to matter in the long run ?
That &apos;s the idea behind The Long News .
It &apos;s a project by The Long Now Foundation , which was founded by TEDsters including Kevin Kelly and Stewart Brand .
And what we &apos;re looking for is news stories that might still matter 50 or 100 or 10,000 years from now .
And when you look at the news through that filter , a lot falls by the wayside .
To take the top stories from the A.P. this last year , is this going to matter in a decade ?
Or this ?
Or this ?
Really ?
Is this going to matter in 50 or 100 years ?
Okay , that was kind of cool .
But the top story of this past year was the economy , and I &apos;m just betting that , sooner or later , this particular recession is going to be old news .
So , what kind of stories might make a difference for the future ?
Well , let &apos;s take science .
Someday , little robots will go through our bloodstreams fixing things .
That someday is already here if you &apos;re a mouse .
Some recent stories : nanobees zap tumors with real bee venom ; they &apos;re sending genes into the brain ; a robot they built that can crawl through the human body .
What about resources ? How are we going to feed nine billion people ?
We &apos;re having trouble feeding six billion today .
As we heard yesterday , there &apos;s over a billion people hungry .
Britain will starve without genetically modified crops .
Bill Gates , fortunately , has bet a billion on &#91; agricultural &#93; research .
What about global politics ?
The world &apos;s going to be very different when and if China sets the agenda , and they may .
They &apos;ve overtaken the U.S. as the world &apos;s biggest car market , they &apos;ve overtaken Germany as the largest exporter , and they &apos;ve started doing DNA tests on kids to choose their careers .
We &apos;re finding all kinds of ways to push back the limits of what we know .
Some recent discoveries : There &apos;s an ant colony from Argentina that has now spread to every continent but Antarctica ; there &apos;s a self-directed robot scientist that &apos;s made a discovery -- soon , science may no longer need us , and life may no longer need us either ; a microbe wakes up after 120,000 years .
It seems that with or without us , life will go on .
But my pick for the top Long News story of this past year was this one : water found on the moon .
Makes it a lot easier to put a colony up there .
And if NASA doesn &apos;t do it , China might , or somebody in this room might write a big check .
My point is this : In the long run , some news stories are more important than others .

&lt; url &gt; http : / / www.ted.com / talks / juan _ enriquez _ how _ to _ think _ about _ digital _ tattoos.html &lt; / url &gt;
All right , so let &apos;s take four subjects that obviously go together : big data , tattoos , immortality and the Greeks .
Right ?
Now , the issue about tattoos is that , without a word , tattoos really do shout .
&#91; Beautiful &#93; &#91; Intriguing &#93; So you don &apos;t have to say a lot .
&#91; Allegiance &#93; &#91; Very intimate &#93; &#91; Serious mistakes &#93; And tattoos tell you a lot of stories .
If I can ask an indiscreet question , how many of you have tattoos ?
A few , but not most .
What happens if Facebook , Google , Twitter , LinkedIn , cell phones , GPS , Foursquare , Yelp , Travel Advisor , all these things you deal with every day turn out to be electronic tattoos ?
And what if they provide as much information about who and what you are as any tattoo ever would ?
What &apos;s ended up happening over the past few decades is the kind of coverage that you had as a head of state or as a great celebrity is now being applied to you every day by all these people who are Tweeting , blogging , following you , watching your credit scores and what you do to yourself .
And electronic tattoos also shout .
And as you &apos;re thinking of the consequences of that , it &apos;s getting really hard to hide from this stuff , among other things , because it &apos;s not just the electronic tattoos , it &apos;s facial recognition that &apos;s getting really good .
So you can take a picture with an iPhone and get all the names , although , again , sometimes it does make mistakes .
But that means you can take a typical bar scene like this , take a picture , say , of this guy right here , get the name , and download all the records before you utter a word or speak to somebody , because everybody turns out to be absolutely plastered by electronic tattoos .
And so there &apos;s companies like face.com that now have about 18 billion faces online .
Here &apos;s what happened to this company .
&#91; Company sold to Facebook , June 18 , 2012 ... &#93; There are other companies that will place a camera like this — this has nothing to do with Facebook — they take your picture , they tie it to the social media , they figure out you really like to wear black dresses , so maybe the person in the store comes up and says , &quot; Hey , we &apos;ve got five black dresses that would just look great on you . &quot;
So what if Andy was wrong ?
Here &apos;s Andy &apos;s theory .
&#91; In the future , everybody will be world famous for 15 minutes . &#93; What if we flip this ?
What if you &apos;re only going to be anonymous for 15 minutes ?
Well , then , because of electronic tattoos , maybe all of you and all of us are very close to immortality , because these tattoos will live far longer than our bodies will .
And if that &apos;s true , then what we want to do is we want to go through four lessons from the Greeks and one lesson from a Latin American .
Why the Greeks ?
Well , the Greeks thought about what happens when gods and humans and immortality mix for a long time .
So lesson number one : Sisyphus .
Remember ? He did a horrible thing , condemned for all time to roll this rock up , it would roll back down , roll back up , roll back down .
It &apos;s a little like your reputation .
Once you get that electronic tattoo , you &apos;re going to be rolling up and down for a long time , so as you go through this stuff , just be careful what you post .
Myth number two : Orpheus , wonderful guy , charming to be around , great partier , great singer , loses his beloved , charms his way into the underworld , only person to charm his way into the underworld , charms the gods of the underworld , they release his beauty on the condition he never look at her until they &apos;re out .
So he &apos;s walking out and walking out and walking out and he just can &apos;t resist . He looks at her , loses her forever .
With all this data out here , it might be a good idea not to look too far into the past of those you love .
Lesson number three : Atalanta .
Greatest runner . She would challenge anybody .
If you won , she would marry you .
If you lost , you died .
How did Hippomenes beat her ?
Well , he had all these wonderful little golden apples , and she &apos;d run ahead , and he &apos;d roll a little golden apple .
She &apos;d run ahead , and he &apos;d roll a little golden apple .
She kept getting distracted . He eventually won the race .
Just remember the purpose as all these little golden apples come and reach you and you want to post about them or tweet about them or send a late-night message .
And then , of course , there &apos;s Narcissus .
Nobody here would ever be accused or be familiar with Narcissus .
But as you &apos;re thinking about Narcissus , just don &apos;t fall in love with your own reflection .
Last lesson , from a Latin American : This is the great poet Jorge Luis Borges .
When he was threatened by the thugs of the Argentine military junta , he came back and said , &quot; Oh , come on , how else can you threaten , other than with death ? &quot;
The interesting thing , the original thing , would be to threaten somebody with immortality .
And that , of course , is what we are all now threatened with today because of electronic tattoos .
Thank you .

In the next 18 minutes , I &apos;m going to take you on a journey .
And it &apos;s a journey that you and I have been on for many years now , and it began some 50 years ago , when humans first stepped off our planet .
And in those 50 years , not only did we literally , physically set foot on the moon , but we have dispatched robotic spacecraft to all the planets -- all eight of them -- and we have landed on asteroids , we have rendezvoused with comets , and , at this point in time , we have a spacecraft on its way to Pluto , the body formerly known as a planet .
And all of these robotic missions are part of a bigger human journey : a voyage to understand something , to get a sense of our cosmic place , to understand something of our origins , and how Earth , our planet , and we , living on it , came to be .
And of all the places in the solar system that we might go to and search for answers to questions like this , there &apos;s Saturn . And we have been to Saturn before -- we visited Saturn in the early 1980s -- but our investigations of Saturn have become far more in-depth in detail since the Cassini spacecraft , traveling across interplanetary space for seven years , glided into orbit around Saturn in the summer of 2004 , and became at that point the farthest robotic outpost that humanity had ever established around the Sun .
Now , the Saturn system is a rich planetary system .
It offers mystery , scientific insight and obviously splendor beyond compare , and the investigation of this system has enormous cosmic reach .
In fact , just studying the rings alone , we stand to learn a lot about the discs of stars and gas that we call the spiral galaxies .
And here &apos;s a beautiful picture of the Andromeda Nebula , which is our closest , largest spiral galaxy to the Milky Way .
And then , here &apos;s a beautiful composite of the Whirlpool Galaxy , taken by the Hubble Space Telescope .
So the journey back to Saturn is really part of and is also a metaphor for a much larger human voyage to understand the interconnectedness of everything around us , and also how humans fit into that picture .
And it pains me that I can &apos;t tell you all that we have learned with Cassini .
I can &apos;t show you all the beautiful pictures that we &apos;ve taken in the last two and a half years , because I simply don &apos;t have the time .
So I &apos;m going to concentrate on two of the most exciting stories that have emerged out of this major exploratory expedition that we are conducting around Saturn , and have been for the past two and a half years .
Saturn is accompanied by a very large and diverse collection of moons .
They range in size from a few kilometers across to as big across as the U.S.
Most of the beautiful pictures we &apos;ve taken of Saturn , in fact , show Saturn in accompaniment with some of its moons . Here &apos;s Saturn with Dione , and then , here &apos;s Saturn showing the rings edge-on , showing you just how vertically thin they are , with the moon Enceladus .
Now , two of the 47 moons that Saturn has are standouts .
And those are Titan and Enceladus . Titan is Saturn &apos;s largest moon , and , until Cassini had arrived there , was the largest single expanse of unexplored terrain that we had remaining in our solar system .
And it is a body that has long intrigued people who &apos;ve watched the planets .
It has a very large , thick atmosphere , and in fact , its surface environment was believed to be more like the environment we have here on the Earth , or at least had in the past , than any other body in the solar system .
Its atmosphere is largely molecular nitrogen , like you are breathing here in this room , except that its atmosphere is suffused with simple organic materials like methane and propane and ethane .
And these molecules high up in the atmosphere of Titan get broken down , and their products join together to make haze particles .
This haze is ubiquitous . It &apos;s completely global and enveloping Titan .
And that &apos;s why you cannot see down to the surface with our eyes in the visible region of the spectrum .
But these haze particles , it was surmised , before we got there with Cassini , over billions and billions of years , gently drifted down to the surface and coated the surface in a thick organic sludge .
So like the equivalent , the Titan equivalent , of tar , or oil , or what -- we didn &apos;t know what .
But this is what we suspected . And these molecules , especially methane and ethane , can be liquids at the surface temperatures of Titan .
And so it turns out that methane is to Titan what water is to the Earth .
It &apos;s a condensable in the atmosphere , and so recognizing this circumstance brought to the fore a whole world of bizarre possibilities . You can have methane clouds , OK , and above those clouds , you have this hundreds of kilometers of haze , which prevent any sunlight from getting to the surface .
The temperature at the surface is some 350 degrees below zero Fahrenheit .
But despite that cold , you could have rain falling down on the surface of Titan .
And doing on Titan what rain does on the Earth : it carves gullies ; it forms rivers and cataracts ; it can create canyons ; it can pool in large basins and craters .
It can wash the sludge off high mountain peaks and hills , down into the lowlands . So stop and think for a minute .
Try to imagine what the surface of Titan might look like .
It &apos;s dark . High noon on Titan is as dark as deep earth twilight on the Earth .
It &apos;s cold , it &apos;s eerie , it &apos;s misty , it might be raining , and you might be standing on the shores of Lake Michigan brimming with paint thinner .
That is the view that we had of the surface of Titan before we got there with Cassini , and I can tell you that what we have found on Titan , though it is not the same in detail , is every bit as fascinating as that story is .
And for us , it has been like -- the Cassini people -- it has been like a Jules Verne adventure come true .
As I said , it has a thick , extensive atmosphere .
This is a picture of Titan , backlit by the Sun , with the rings as a beautiful backdrop .
And yet another moon there -- I don &apos;t even know which one it is . It &apos;s a very extensive atmosphere .
We have instruments on Cassini which can see down to the surface through this atmosphere , and my camera system is one of them .
And we have taken pictures like this .
And what you see is bright and dark regions , and that &apos;s about as far as it got for us .
It was so mystifying : we couldn &apos;t make out what we were seeing on Titan .
When you look closer at this region , you start to see things like sinuous channels -- we didn &apos;t know . You see a few round things .
This , we later found out , is , in fact , a crater , but there are very few craters on the surface of Titan , meaning it &apos;s a very young surface .
And there are features that look tectonic .
They look like they &apos;ve been pulled apart .
Whenever you see anything linear on a planet , it means there &apos;s been a fracture , like a fault .
And so it &apos;s been tectonically altered .
But we couldn &apos;t make sense of our images , until , six months after we got into orbit , an event occurred that many have regarded as the highlight of Cassini &apos;s investigation of Titan .
And that was the deployment of the Huygens probe , the European-built Huygens probe that Cassini had carried for seven years across the solar system . We deployed it to the atmosphere of Titan , it took two and a half hours to descend , and it landed on the surface .
And I just want to emphasize how significant an event this is .
This is a device of human making , and it landed in the outer solar system for the first time in human history .
It is so significant that , in my mind , this was an event that should have been celebrated with ticker tape parades in every city across the U.S. and Europe , and sadly , that wasn &apos;t the case .
.
It was significant for another reason . This is an international mission , and this event was celebrated in Europe , in Germany , and the celebratory presentations were given in English accents , and American accents , and German accents , and French and Italian and Dutch accents .
It was a moving demonstration of what the words &quot; united nations &quot; are supposed to mean : a true union of nations joined together in a colossal effort for good .
And , in this case , it was a massive undertaking to explore a planet , and to come to understand a planetary system that , for all of human history , had been unreachable , and now humans had actually touched it .
So it was -- I mean , I &apos;m getting goose bumps just talking about it .
It was a tremendously emotional event , and it &apos;s something that I will personally never forget , and you shouldn &apos;t either .
But anyway , the probe took measurements of the atmosphere on the way down , and it also took panoramic pictures .
And I can &apos;t tell you what it was like to see the first pictures of Titan &apos;s surface from the probe . And this is what we saw .
And it was a shocker , because it was everything we wanted those other pictures taken from orbit to be .
It was an unambiguous pattern , a geological pattern .
It &apos;s a dendritic drainage pattern that can be formed only by the flow of liquids .
And you can follow these channels and you can see how they all converge .
And they converge into this channel here , which drains into this region .
You are looking at a shoreline .
Was this a shoreline of fluids ? We didn &apos;t know .
But this is somewhat of a shoreline .
This picture is taken at 16 kilometers .
This is the picture taken at eight kilometers , OK ? Again , the shoreline .
Okay , now , 16 kilometers , eight kilometers -- this is roughly an airline altitude .
If you were going to take an airplane trip across the U.S. , you would be flying at these altitudes .
So , this is the picture you would have at the window of Titanian Airlines as you fly across the surface of Titan .
And then finally , the probe came to rest on the surface , and I &apos;m going to show you , ladies and gentlemen , the first picture ever taken from the surface of a moon in the outer solar system .
And here is the horizon , OK ?
These are probably water ice pebbles , yes ?
And obviously , it landed in one of these flat , dark regions and it didn &apos;t sink out of sight . So it wasn &apos;t fluid that we landed in .
What the probe came down in was basically the Titan equivalent of a mud flat .
This is an unconsolidated ground that is suffused with liquid methane .
And it &apos;s probably the case that this material has washed off the highlands of Titan through these channels that we saw , and has drained over billions of years to fill in low-lying basins .
And that is what the Huygens probe landed in .
But still , there was no sign in our images , or even in the Huygens &apos; images , of any large , open bodies of fluids .
Where were they ? It got even more puzzling when we found dunes .
OK , so this is our movie of the equatorial region of Titan , showing these dunes . These are dunes that are 100 meters tall , separated by a few kilometers , and they go on for miles and miles and miles .
There &apos;s hundreds , up to a 1,000 or 1,200 miles of dunes .
This is the Saharan desert of Titan .
It &apos;s obviously a place which is very dry , or you wouldn &apos;t get dunes .
So again , it got puzzling that there were no bodies of fluid , until finally , we saw lakes in the polar regions .
And there is a lake scene in the south polar region of Titan .
It &apos;s about the size of Lake Ontario .
And then , only a week and a half ago , we flew over the north pole of Titan and found , again , we found a feature here the size of the Caspian Sea .
So it seems that the liquids , for some reason we don &apos;t understand , or during at least this season , are apparently at the poles of Titan .
And I think you would agree that we have found Titan is a remarkable , mystical place . It &apos;s exotic , it &apos;s alien , but yet strangely Earth-like , and having Earth-like geological formations and a tremendous geographical diversity , and is a fascinating world whose only rival in the solar system for complexity and richness is the Earth itself .
And so now we go onto Enceladus . Enceladus is a small moon , it &apos;s about a tenth the size of Titan . And you can see it here next to England , just to show you the size . This is not meant to be a threat .
And Enceladus is very white , it &apos;s very bright , and its surface is obviously wrecked with fractures .
It is a very geologically active body .
But the mother lode of discoveries on Enceladus was found at the south pole -- and we &apos;re looking at the south pole here -- where we found this system of fractures .
And they &apos;re a different color because they &apos;re a different composition .
They are coated . These fractures are coated with organic materials .
Moreover , this whole , entire region , the south polar region , has elevated temperatures . It &apos;s the hottest place on the planet , on the body .
That &apos;s as bizarre as finding that the Antarctic on the Earth is hotter than the tropics .
And then , when we took additional pictures , we discovered that from these fractures are issuing jets of fine , icy particles extending hundreds of miles into space .
And when we color-code this image , to bring out the faint light levels , we see that these jets feed a plume that , in fact , we see , in other images , goes thousands of miles into the space above Enceladus .
My team and I have examined images like this , and like this one , and have thought about the other results from Cassini .
And we have arrived at the conclusion that these jets may be erupting from pockets of liquid water under the surface of Enceladus .
So we have , possibly , liquid water , organic materials and excess heat .
In other words , we have possibly stumbled upon the holy grail of modern day planetary exploration , or in other words , an environment that is potentially suitable for living organisms .
And I don &apos;t think I need to tell you that the discovery of life elsewhere in our solar system , whether it be on Enceladus or elsewhere , would have enormous cultural and scientific implications .
Because if we could demonstrate that genesis had occurred not once , but twice , independently , in our solar system , then that means , by inference , it has occurred a staggering number of times throughout the universe and its 13.7 billion year history .
Right now , Earth is the only planet still that we know is teeming with life .
It is precious , it is unique , it is still , so far , the only home we &apos;ve ever known .
And if any of you were alert and coherent during the 1960s -- and we &apos;d forgive you , if you weren &apos;t , OK -- you would remember this very famous picture taken by the Apollo 8 astronauts in 1968 .
It was the first time that Earth was imaged from space , and it had an enormous impact on our sense of place in the universe , and our sense of responsibility for the protection of our own planet .
Well , we on Cassini have taken an equivalent first , a picture that no human eye has ever seen before .
It is a total eclipse of the Sun , seen from the other side of Saturn .
And in this impossibly beautiful picture , you see the main rings backlit by the Sun , you see the refracted image of the Sun and you see this ring created , in fact , by the exhalations of Enceladus .
But as if that weren &apos;t brilliant enough , we can spot , in this beautiful image , sight of our own planet , cradled in the arms of Saturn &apos;s rings .
Now , there is something deeply moving about seeing ourselves from afar , and capturing the sight of our little , blue-ocean planet in the skies of other worlds .
And that , and the perspective of ourselves that we gain from that , may be , in the end , the finest reward that we earn from this journey of discovery that started half a century ago .
And thank you very much .

In 2008 , Cyclone Nargis devastated Myanmar .
Millions of people were in severe need of help .
The U.N. wanted to rush people and supplies to the area .
But there were no maps , no maps of roads , no maps showing hospitals , no way for help to reach the cyclone victims .
When we look at a map of Los Angeles or London , it is hard to believe that as of 2005 , only 15 percent of the world was mapped to a geo-codable level of detail .
The U.N. ran headfirst into a problem that the majority of the world &apos;s populous faces : not having detailed maps .
But help was coming .
At Google , 40 volunteers used a new software to map 120,000 kilometers of roads , 3,000 hospitals , logistics and relief points .
And it took them four days .
The new software they used ? Google Mapmaker .
Google Mapmaker is a technology that empowers each of us to map what we know locally .
People have used this software to map everything from roads to rivers , from schools to local businesses , and video stores to the corner store .
Maps matter .
Nobel Prize nominee Hernando De Soto recognized that the key to economic liftoff for most developing countries is to tap the vast amounts of uncapitalized land .
For example , a trillion dollars of real estate remains uncapitalized in India alone .
In the last year alone , thousands of users in 170 countries have mapped millions of pieces of information , and created a map of a level of detail never thought viable .
And this was made possible by the power of passionate users everywhere .
Let &apos;s look at some of the maps being created by users right now .
So , as we speak , people are mapping the world in these 170 countries .
You can see Bridget in Africa who just mapped a road in Senegal .
And , closer to home , Chalua , an N.G. road in Bangalore .
This is the result of computational geometry , gesture recognition , and machine learning .
This is a victory of thousands of users , in hundreds of cities , one user , one edit at a time .
This is an invitation to the 70 percent of our unmapped planet .
Welcome to the new world .

How do you explain when things don &apos;t go as we assume ?
Or better , how do you explain when others are able to achieve things that seem to defy all of the assumptions ?
For example : Why is Apple so innovative ?
Year after year , after year , after year , they &apos;re more innovative than all their competition .
And yet , they &apos;re just a computer company .
They &apos;re just like everyone else .
They have the same access to the same talent , the same agencies , the same consultants , the same media .
Then why is it that they seem to have something different ?
Why is it that Martin Luther King led the Civil Rights Movement ?
He wasn &apos;t the only man who suffered in a pre-civil rights America , and he certainly wasn &apos;t the only great orator of the day .
Why him ?
And why is it that the Wright brothers were able to figure out controlled , powered man flight when there were certainly other teams who were better qualified , better funded ...
and they didn &apos;t achieve powered man flight , and the Wright brothers beat them to it .
There &apos;s something else at play here .
About three and a half years ago I made a discovery .
And this discovery profoundly changed my view on how I thought the world worked , and it even profoundly changed the way in which I operate in it .
As it turns out , there &apos;s a pattern .
As it turns out , all the great and inspiring leaders and organizations in the world -- whether it &apos;s Apple or Martin Luther King or the Wright brothers -- they all think , act and communicate the exact same way .
And it &apos;s the complete opposite to everyone else .
All I did was codify it , and it &apos;s probably the world &apos;s simplest idea .
I call it the golden circle .
Why ? How ? What ?
This little idea explains why some organizations and some leaders are able to inspire where others aren &apos;t .
Let me define the terms really quickly .
Every single person , every single organization on the planet knows what they do , 100 percent .
Some know how they do it , whether you call it your differentiated value proposition or your proprietary process or your USP .
But very , very few people or organizations know why they do what they do .
And by &quot; why &quot; I don &apos;t mean &quot; to make a profit . &quot;
That &apos;s a result . It &apos;s always a result .
By &quot; why , &quot; I mean : What &apos;s your purpose ?
What &apos;s your cause ? What &apos;s your belief ?
Why does your organization exist ?
Why do you get out of bed in the morning ?
And why should anyone care ?
Well , as a result , the way we think , the way we act , the way we communicate is from the outside in .
It &apos;s obvious . We go from the clearest thing to the fuzziest thing .
But the inspired leaders and the inspired organizations -- regardless of their size , regardless of their industry -- all think , act and communicate from the inside out .
Let me give you an example .
I use Apple because they &apos;re easy to understand and everybody gets it .
If Apple were like everyone else , a marketing message from them might sound like this : &quot; We make great computers .
They &apos;re beautifully designed , simple to use and user friendly .
Want to buy one ? &quot; &quot; Meh . &quot;
And that &apos;s how most of us communicate .
That &apos;s how most marketing is done , that &apos;s how most sales is done and that &apos;s how most of us communicate interpersonally .
We say what we do , we say how we &apos;re different or how we &apos;re better and we expect some sort of a behavior , a purchase , a vote , something like that .
Here &apos;s our new law firm : We have the best lawyers with the biggest clients , we always perform for our clients who do business with us .
Here &apos;s our new car : It gets great gas mileage , it has leather seats , buy our car .
But it &apos;s uninspiring .
Here &apos;s how Apple actually communicates .
&quot; Everything we do , we believe in challenging the status quo .
We believe in thinking differently .
The way we challenge the status quo is by making our products beautifully designed , simple to use and user friendly .
We just happen to make great computers .
Want to buy one ? &quot;
Totally different right ? You &apos;re ready to buy a computer from me .
All I did was reverse the order of the information .
What it proves to us is that people don &apos;t buy what you do ; people buy why you do it .
People don &apos;t buy what you do ; they buy why you do it .
This explains why every single person in this room is perfectly comfortable buying a computer from Apple .
But we &apos;re also perfectly comfortable buying an MP3 player from Apple , or a phone from Apple , or a DVR from Apple .
But , as I said before , Apple &apos;s just a computer company .
There &apos;s nothing that distinguishes them structurally from any of their competitors .
Their competitors are all equally qualified to make all of these products .
In fact , they tried .
A few years ago , Gateway came out with flat screen TVs .
They &apos;re eminently qualified to make flat screen TVs .
They &apos;ve been making flat screen monitors for years .
Nobody bought one .
Dell came out with MP3 players and PDAs , and they make great quality products , and they can make perfectly well-designed products -- and nobody bought one .
In fact , talking about it now , we can &apos;t even imagine buying an MP3 player from Dell .
Why would you buy an MP3 player from a computer company ?
But we do it every day .
People don &apos;t buy what you do ; they buy why you do it .
The goal is not to do business with everybody who needs what you have .
The goal is to do business with people who believe what you believe .
Here &apos;s the best part : None of what I &apos;m telling you is my opinion .
It &apos;s all grounded in the tenets of biology .
Not psychology , biology .
If you look at a cross-section of the human brain , looking from the top down , what you see is the human brain is actually broken into three major components that correlate perfectly with the golden circle .
Our newest brain , our Homo sapien brain , our neocortex , corresponds with the &quot; what &quot; level .
The neocortex is responsible for all of our rational and analytical thought and language .
The middle two sections make up our limbic brains , and our limbic brains are responsible for all of our feelings , like trust and loyalty .
It &apos;s also responsible for all human behavior , all decision-making , and it has no capacity for language .
In other words , when we communicate from the outside in , yes , people can understand vast amounts of complicated information like features and benefits and facts and figures .
It just doesn &apos;t drive behavior .
When we can communicate from the inside out , we &apos;re talking directly to the part of the brain that controls behavior , and then we allow people to rationalize it with the tangible things we say and do .
This is where gut decisions come from .
You know , sometimes you can give somebody all the facts and figures , and they say , &quot; I know what all the facts and details say , but it just doesn &apos;t feel right . &quot;
Why would we use that verb , it doesn &apos;t &quot; feel &quot; right ?
Because the part of the brain that controls decision-making doesn &apos;t control language .
And the best we can muster up is , &quot; I don &apos;t know . It just doesn &apos;t feel right . &quot;
Or sometimes you say you &apos;re leading with your heart , or you &apos;re leading with your soul .
Well , I hate to break it to you , those aren &apos;t other body parts controlling your behavior .
It &apos;s all happening here in your limbic brain , the part of the brain that controls decision-making and not language .
But if you don &apos;t know why you do what you do , and people respond to why you do what you do , then how will you ever get people to vote for you , or buy something from you , or , more importantly , be loyal and want to be a part of what it is that you do .
Again , the goal is not just to sell to people who need what you have ; the goal is to sell to people who believe what you believe .
The goal is not just to hire people who need a job ; it &apos;s to hire people who believe what you believe .
I always say that , you know , if you hire people just because they can do a job , they &apos;ll work for your money , but if you hire people who believe what you believe , they &apos;ll work for you with blood and sweat and tears .
And nowhere else is there a better example of this than with the Wright brothers .
Most people don &apos;t know about Samuel Pierpont Langley .
And back in the early 20th century , the pursuit of powered man flight was like the dot com of the day .
Everybody was trying it .
And Samuel Pierpont Langley had , what we assume , to be the recipe for success .
I mean , even now , you ask people , &quot; Why did your product or why did your company fail ? &quot;
and people always give you the same permutation of the same three things : under-capitalized , the wrong people , bad market conditions .
It &apos;s always the same three things , so let &apos;s explore that .
Samuel Pierpont Langley was given 50,000 dollars by the War Department to figure out this flying machine .
Money was no problem .
He held a seat at Harvard and worked at the Smithsonian and was extremely well-connected ; he knew all the big minds of the day .
He hired the best minds money could find and the market conditions were fantastic .
The New York Times followed him around everywhere , and everyone was rooting for Langley .
Then how come we &apos;ve never heard of Samuel Pierpont Langley ?
A few hundred miles away in Dayton Ohio , Orville and Wilbur Wright , they had none of what we consider to be the recipe for success .
They had no money ; they paid for their dream with the proceeds from their bicycle shop ; not a single person on the Wright brothers &apos; team had a college education , not even Orville or Wilbur ; and The New York Times followed them around nowhere .
The difference was , Orville and Wilbur were driven by a cause , by a purpose , by a belief .
They believed that if they could figure out this flying machine , it &apos;ll change the course of the world .
Samuel Pierpont Langley was different .
He wanted to be rich , and he wanted to be famous .
He was in pursuit of the result .
He was in pursuit of the riches .
And lo and behold , look what happened .
The people who believed in the Wright brothers &apos; dream worked with them with blood and sweat and tears .
The others just worked for the paycheck .
And they tell stories of how every time the Wright brothers went out , they would have to take five sets of parts , because that &apos;s how many times they would crash before they came in for supper .
And , eventually , on December 17th , 1903 , the Wright brothers took flight , and no one was there to even experience it .
We found out about it a few days later .
And further proof that Langley was motivated by the wrong thing : The day the Wright brothers took flight , he quit .
He could have said , &quot; That &apos;s an amazing discovery , guys , and I will improve upon your technology , &quot; but he didn &apos;t .
He wasn &apos;t first , he didn &apos;t get rich , he didn &apos;t get famous so he quit .
People don &apos;t buy what you do ; they buy why you do it .
And if you talk about what you believe , you will attract those who believe what you believe .
But why is it important to attract those who believe what you believe ?
Something called the law of diffusion of innovation , and if you don &apos;t know the law , you definitely know the terminology .
The first two and a half percent of our population are our innovators .
The next 13 and a half percent of our population are our early adopters .
The next 34 percent are your early majority , your late majority and your laggards .
The only reason these people buy touch tone phones is because you can &apos;t buy rotary phones anymore .
We all sit at various places at various times on this scale , but what the law of diffusion of innovation tells us is that if you want mass-market success or mass-market acceptance of an idea , you cannot have it until you achieve this tipping point between 15 and 18 percent market penetration , and then the system tips .
And I love asking businesses , &quot; What &apos;s your conversion on new business ? &quot;
And they love to tell you , &quot; Oh , it &apos;s about 10 percent , &quot; proudly .
Well , you can trip over 10 percent of the customers .
We all have about 10 percent who just &quot; get it . &quot;
That &apos;s how we describe them , right ?
That &apos;s like that gut feeling , &quot; Oh , they just get it . &quot;
The problem is : How do you find the ones that get it before you &apos;re doing business with them versus the ones who don &apos;t get it ?
So it &apos;s this here , this little gap that you have to close , as Jeffrey Moore calls it , &quot; Crossing the Chasm &quot; -- because , you see , the early majority will not try something until someone else has tried it first .
And these guys , the innovators and the early adopters , they &apos;re comfortable making those gut decisions .
They &apos;re more comfortable making those intuitive decisions that are driven by what they believe about the world and not just what product is available .
These are the people who stood in line for six hours to buy an iPhone when they first came out , when you could have just walked into the store the next week and bought one off the shelf .
These are the people who spent 40,000 dollars on flat screen TVs when they first came out , even though the technology was substandard .
And , by the way , they didn &apos;t do it because the technology was so great ; they did it for themselves .
It &apos;s because they wanted to be first .
People don &apos;t buy what you do ; they buy why you do it and what you do simply proves what you believe .
In fact , people will do the things that prove what they believe .
The reason that person bought the iPhone in the first six hours , stood in line for six hours , was because of what they believed about the world , and how they wanted everybody to see them : They were first .
People don &apos;t buy what you do ; they buy why you do it .
So let me give you a famous example , a famous failure and a famous success of the law of diffusion of innovation .
First , the famous failure .
It &apos;s a commercial example .
As we said before , a second ago , the recipe for success is money and the right people and the right market conditions , right ? You should have success then .
Look at TiVo .
From the time TiVo came out about eight or nine years ago to this current day , they are the single highest-quality product on the market , hands down , there is no dispute .
They were extremely well-funded .
Market conditions were fantastic .
I mean , we use TiVo as verb .
I TiVo stuff on my piece of junk Time Warner DVR all the time .
But TiVo &apos;s a commercial failure .
They &apos;ve never made money .
And when they went IPO , their stock was at about 30 or 40 dollars and then plummeted , and it &apos;s never traded above 10 .
In fact , I don &apos;t think it &apos;s even traded above six , except for a couple of little spikes .
Because you see , when TiVo launched their product they told us all what they had .
They said , &quot; We have a product that pauses live TV , skips commercials , rewinds live TV and memorizes your viewing habits without you even asking . &quot;
And the cynical majority said , &quot; We don &apos;t believe you .
We don &apos;t need it . We don &apos;t like it .
You &apos;re scaring us . &quot;
What if they had said , &quot; If you &apos;re the kind of person who likes to have total control over every aspect of your life , boy , do we have a product for you .
It pauses live TV , skips commercials , memorizes your viewing habits , etc . , etc . &quot;
People don &apos;t buy what you do ; they buy why you do it , and what you do simply serves as the proof of what you believe .
Now let me give you a successful example of the law of diffusion of innovation .
In the summer of 1963 , 250,000 people showed up on the mall in Washington to hear Dr. King speak .
They sent out no invitations , and there was no website to check the date .
How do you do that ?
Well , Dr. King wasn &apos;t the only man in America who was a great orator .
He wasn &apos;t the only man in America who suffered in a pre-civil rights America .
In fact , some of his ideas were bad .
But he had a gift .
He didn &apos;t go around telling people what needed to change in America .
He went around and told people what he believed .
&quot; I believe , I believe , I believe , &quot; he told people .
And people who believed what he believed took his cause , and they made it their own , and they told people .
And some of those people created structures to get the word out to even more people .
And lo and behold , 250,000 people showed up on the right day at the right time to hear him speak .
How many of them showed up for him ?
Zero .
They showed up for themselves .
It &apos;s what they believed about America that got them to travel in a bus for eight hours to stand in the sun in Washington in the middle of August .
It &apos;s what they believed , and it wasn &apos;t about black versus white : 25 percent of the audience was white .
Dr. King believed that there are two types of laws in this world : those that are made by a higher authority and those that are made by man .
And not until all the laws that are made by man are consistent with the laws that are made by the higher authority will we live in a just world .
It just so happened that the Civil Rights Movement was the perfect thing to help him bring his cause to life .
We followed , not for him , but for ourselves .
And , by the way , he gave the &quot; I have a dream &quot; speech , not the &quot; I have a plan &quot; speech .
Listen to politicians now , with their comprehensive 12-point plans .
They &apos;re not inspiring anybody .
Because there are leaders and there are those who lead .
Leaders hold a position of power or authority , but those who lead inspire us .
Whether they &apos;re individuals or organizations , we follow those who lead , not because we have to , but because we want to .
We follow those who lead , not for them , but for ourselves .
And it &apos;s those who start with &quot; why &quot; that have the ability to inspire those around them or find others who inspire them .
Thank you very much .

The kind of neuroscience that I do and my colleagues do is almost like the weatherman .
We are always chasing storms .
We want to see and measure storms -- brainstorms , that is .
And we all talk about brainstorms in our daily lives , but we rarely see or listen to one .
So I always like to start these talks by actually introducing you to one of them .
Actually , the first time we recorded more than one neuron -- a hundred brain cells simultaneously -- we could measure the electrical sparks of a hundred cells in the same animal , this is the first image we got , the first 10 seconds of this recording .
So we got a little snippet of a thought , and we could see it in front of us .
I always tell the students that we could also call neuroscientists some sort of astronomer , because we are dealing with a system that is only comparable in terms of number of cells to the number of galaxies that we have in the universe .
And here we are , out of billions of neurons , just recording , 10 years ago , a hundred .
We are doing a thousand now .
And we hope to understand something fundamental about our human nature .
Because , if you don &apos;t know yet , everything that we use to define what human nature is comes from these storms , comes from these storms that roll over the hills and valleys of our brains and define our memories , our beliefs , our feelings , our plans for the future .
Everything that we ever do , everything that every human has ever done , do or will do , requires the toil of populations of neurons producing these kinds of storms .
And the sound of a brainstorm , if you &apos;ve never heard one , is somewhat like this .
You can put it louder if you can .
My son calls this &quot; making popcorn while listening to a badly-tuned A.M. station . &quot;
This is a brain .
This is what happens when you route these electrical storms to a loudspeaker and you listen to a hundred brain cells firing , your brain will sound like this -- my brain , any brain .
And what we want to do as neuroscientists in this time is to actually listen to these symphonies , these brain symphonies , and try to extract from them the messages they carry .
In particular , about 12 years ago we created a preparation that we named brain-machine interfaces .
And you have a scheme here that describes how it works .
The idea is , let &apos;s have some sensors that listen to these storms , this electrical firing , and see if you can , in the same time that it takes for this storm to leave the brain and reach the legs or the arms of an animal -- about half a second -- let &apos;s see if we can read these signals , extract the motor messages that are embedded in it , translate it into digital commands and send it to an artificial device that will reproduce the voluntary motor wheel of that brain in real time .
And see if we can measure how well we can translate that message when we compare to the way the body does that .
And if we can actually provide feedback , sensory signals that go back from this robotic , mechanical , computational actuator that is now under the control of the brain , back to the brain , how the brain deals with that , of receiving messages from an artificial piece of machinery .
And that &apos;s exactly what we did 10 years ago .
We started with a superstar monkey called Aurora that became one of the superstars of this field .
And Aurora liked to play video games .
As you can see here , she likes to use a joystick , like any one of us , any of our kids , to play this game .
And as a good primate , she even tries to cheat before she gets the right answer .
So even before a target appears that she &apos;s supposed to cross with the cursor that she &apos;s controlling with this joystick , Aurora is trying to find the target , no matter where it is .
And if she &apos;s doing that , because every time she crosses that target with the little cursor , she gets a drop of Brazilian orange juice .
And I can tell you , any monkey will do anything for you if you get a little drop of Brazilian orange juice .
Actually any primate will do that .
Think about that .
Well , while Aurora was playing this game , as you saw , and doing a thousand trials a day and getting 97 percent correct and 350 milliliters of orange juice , we are recording the brainstorms that are produced in her head and sending them to a robotic arm that was learning to reproduce the movements that Aurora was making .
Because the idea was to actually turn on this brain-machine interface and have Aurora play the game just by thinking , without interference of her body .
Her brainstorms would control an arm that would move the cursor and cross the target .
And to our shock , that &apos;s exactly what Aurora did .
She played the game without moving her body .
So every trajectory that you see of the cursor now , this is the exact first moment she got that .
That &apos;s the exact first moment a brain intention was liberated from the physical domains of a body of a primate and could act outside , in that outside world , just by controlling an artificial device .
And Aurora kept playing the game , kept finding the little target and getting the orange juice that she wanted to get , that she craved for .
Well , she did that because she , at that time , had acquired a new arm .
The robotic arm that you see moving here 30 days later , after the first video that I showed to you , is under the control of Aurora &apos;s brain and is moving the cursor to get to the target .
And Aurora now knows that she can play the game with this robotic arm , but she has not lost the ability to use her biological arms to do what she pleases .
She can scratch her back , she can scratch one of us , she can play another game .
By all purposes and means , Aurora &apos;s brain has incorporated that artificial device as an extension of her body .
The model of the self that Aurora had in her mind has been expanded to get one more arm .
Well , we did that 10 years ago .
Just fast forward 10 years .
Just last year we realized that you don &apos;t even need to have a robotic device .
You can just build a computational body , an avatar , a monkey avatar .
And you can actually use it for our monkeys to either interact with them , or you can train them to assume in a virtual world the first-person perspective of that avatar and use her brain activity to control the movements of the avatar &apos;s arms or legs .
And what we did basically was to train the animals to learn how to control these avatars and explore objects that appear in the virtual world .
And these objects are visually identical , but when the avatar crosses the surface of these objects , they send an electrical message that is proportional to the microtactile texture of the object that goes back directly to the monkey &apos;s brain , informing the brain what it is the avatar is touching .
And in just four weeks , the brain learns to process this new sensation and acquires a new sensory pathway -- like a new sense .
And you truly liberate the brain now because you are allowing the brain to send motor commands to move this avatar .
And the feedback that comes from the avatar is being processed directly by the brain without the interference of the skin .
So what you see here is this is the design of the task .
You &apos;re going to see an animal basically touching these three targets .
And he has to select one because only one carries the reward , the orange juice that they want to get .
And he has to select it by touch using a virtual arm , an arm that doesn &apos;t exist .
And that &apos;s exactly what they do .
This is a complete liberation of the brain from the physical constraints of the body and the motor in a perceptual task .
The animal is controlling the avatar to touch the targets .
And he &apos;s sensing the texture by receiving an electrical message directly in the brain .
And the brain is deciding what is the texture associated with the reward .
The legends that you see in the movie don &apos;t appear for the monkey .
And by the way , they don &apos;t read English anyway , so they are here just for you to know that the correct target is shifting position .
And yet , they can find them by tactile discrimination , and they can press it and select it .
So when we look at the brains of these animals , on the top panel you see the alignment of 125 cells showing what happens with the brain activity , the electrical storms , of this sample of neurons in the brain when the animal is using a joystick .
And that &apos;s a picture that every neurophysiologist knows .
The basic alignment shows that these cells are coding for all possible directions .
The bottom picture is what happens when the body stops moving and the animal starts controlling either a robotic device or a computational avatar .
As fast as we can reset our computers , the brain activity shifts to start representing this new tool , as if this too was a part of that primate &apos;s body .
The brain is assimilating that too , as fast as we can measure .
So that suggests to us that our sense of self does not end at the last layer of the epithelium of our bodies , but it ends at the last layer of electrons of the tools that we &apos;re commanding with our brains .
Our violins , our cars , our bicycles , our soccer balls , our clothing -- they all become assimilated by this voracious , amazing , dynamic system called the brain .
How far can we take it ?
Well , in an experiment that we ran a few years ago , we took this to the limit .
We had an animal running on a treadmill at Duke University on the East Coast of the United States , producing the brainstorms necessary to move .
And we had a robotic device , a humanoid robot , in Kyoto , Japan at ATR Laboratories that was dreaming its entire life to be controlled by a brain , a human brain , or a primate brain .
What happens here is that the brain activity that generated the movements in the monkey was transmitted to Japan and made this robot walk while footage of this walking was sent back to Duke , so that the monkey could see the legs of this robot walking in front of her .
So she could be rewarded , not by what her body was doing but for every correct step of the robot on the other side of the planet controlled by her brain activity .
Funny thing , that round trip around the globe took 20 milliseconds less than it takes for that brainstorm to leave its head , the head of the monkey , and reach its own muscle .
The monkey was moving a robot that was six times bigger , across the planet .
This is one of the experiments in which that robot was able to walk autonomously .
This is CB1 fulfilling its dream in Japan under the control of the brain activity of a primate .
So where are we taking all this ?
What are we going to do with all this research , besides studying the properties of this dynamic universe that we have between our ears ?
Well the idea is to take all this knowledge and technology and try to restore one of the most severe neurological problems that we have in the world .
Millions of people have lost the ability to translate these brainstorms into action , into movement .
Although their brains continue to produce those storms and code for movements , they cannot cross a barrier that was created by a lesion on the spinal cord .
So our idea is to create a bypass , is to use these brain-machine interfaces to read these signals , larger-scale brainstorms that contain the desire to move again , bypass the lesion using computational microengineering and send it to a new body , a whole body called an exoskeleton , a whole robotic suit that will become the new body of these patients .
And you can see an image produced by this consortium .
This is a nonprofit consortium called the Walk Again Project that is putting together scientists from Europe , from here in the United States , and in Brazil together to work to actually get this new body built -- a body that we believe , through the same plastic mechanisms that allow Aurora and other monkeys to use these tools through a brain-machine interface and that allows us to incorporate the tools that we produce and use in our daily life .
This same mechanism , we hope , will allow these patients , not only to imagine again the movements that they want to make and translate them into movements of this new body , but for this body to be assimilated as the new body that the brain controls .
So I was told about 10 years ago that this would never happen , that this was close to impossible .
And I can only tell you that as a scientist , I grew up in southern Brazil in the mid- &apos; 60s watching a few crazy guys telling &#91; us &#93; that they would go to the Moon .
And I was five years old , and I never understood why NASA didn &apos;t hire Captain Kirk and Spock to do the job ; after all , they were very proficient -- but just seeing that as a kid made me believe , as my grandmother used to tell me , that &quot; impossible is just the possible that someone has not put in enough effort to make it come true . &quot;
So they told me that it &apos;s impossible to make someone walk .
I think I &apos;m going to follow my grandmother &apos;s advice .
Thank you .
